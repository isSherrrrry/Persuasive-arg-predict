"I believe women are only interested in men for their suitability for support/protection, and nothing else. Please, please, please CMV.","I realize I haven't had the best history with the opposite sex and it's likely causing, or at least influencing this view. But when I see posts like this one in /r/morbidreality where this woman [loses her fiance](www.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/1rk4j7/the_picture_of_a_woman_that_just_learned_that_her/), the only thing I can think that she's thinking is ""oh no, my future support so that I don't have to ever work a day in my life. Oh no, I wasted years trying to track down someone like that who was willing to support me and protect me while I get fat and ugly, now the person I find next won't be as good of a protector/win me as much bread, there goes the princess lifestyle that I've been told to expect to get for years."" or ""If only it had happened in a couple months, I'd have collected BIG on life insurance!""  I'm dating. I have no trouble *attracting* women. Even keeping them isn't a problem, but I'm getting really sick of these sorts of thoughts. I realize they're misogynistic. But at the same time, after all the times I've been taken advantage of and had my sex/gender used as justification for it from family and lovers... I can't think of anything else that might motivate a woman except protection in the form of him-as-a-bodyguard, free money from mooching, or whatever.  Prior abuse from mother/grandmother as a boy and figures that I tried to fill the void with (I.E. when I was unable to win my own bread) has filled me with the notion that a woman will abuse you/scorn you/hate you/beat you if you can do nothing for them. In the dating world (I am just really attractive. I don't have ""game"" or any of that crap, I can't dance, I don't try and be ""alpha as fuck."" I'm just me.), I'm very successful, and for someone my age, I'm very well off financially. Early exes (when I was dirt poor) treated me like crap. Women recently have tended to treat me very, very well. This has led me to add to the above rule of ""will beat you/hate you/spite you if you cannot do anything for them, but if you can do something for them, they will suddenly bend over backwards to get you to commit to them.   This has left me with nightmares, waking up in a cold sweat that someday I'll lose my income and it'll go back to the beatings from someone I am trying to love, out of both duty and a genuine desire to not feel so alone in life.  Alright, that's about it. Thanks. Please CMV. This is starting to interfere with my daily life.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you feel this way more than you think this way. Thoughts often follow feelings, not the other way around. Given your history of abuse, it makes sense for you to conceptualize women this way, rationalizing their behavior in a way that explains your experiences and observations. Believing the women in your life now love you for you, and not your money, is a huge risk on your part. It is also the opposite of what you&amp;#39;ve experienced. To believe you are valuable for who you are and not your money only to have that proven wrong and be rejected for who you are, would be very traumatic. That is also exactly what it sounds like you experienced as a child. You were perhaps taught that who you are is worthless to women.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For you, material success sounds like your only source of worth because it&amp;#39;s the only thing you can think of that would explain your experiences. You may feel worthless and unlovable without it. Considering the only time in your life women have treated you well is after you acquired money, the fear of losing your wealth means losing their love. Losing your source of worth means returning to the abuse(and perhaps a sense of worthlessness). If the only thing you can see that changed between then and now is your wealth, it&amp;#39;s easy to understand how you made the connection between love and financial success/utility. And quite frankly, it makes it immensely valuable to you because it&amp;#39;s your only perceived means of feeling loved, so your fear of losing it is justified.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, your perception of the world is shaped by your unique experiences and it is &lt;strong&gt;not universally accurate&lt;/strong&gt;. No one&amp;#39;s is. It is a means to conceptualize and understand what you&amp;#39;ve personally experienced and adapt you for your specific environment, it serves that purpose. It&amp;#39;s not a means of finding truth. Feelings are not truth. I get it if accepting another explanation is difficult, it&amp;#39;s a big risk. I get it if everything in you is trying to protect you from re-living those traumas from your past by maintaining this view of the world. Its possible you even suspect an ulterior motive when people say women are different than you feel they are. But I think you are wrong and so do a lot of others. Accepting that may require profession help and I encourage you to seek it. It isn&amp;#39;t as simple as changing a fact in your head. Your worldview was built this way for a reason, those reasons have to be addressed. You are valuable for more than your utility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I shall only provide anecdotal evidence in full realization that my comment alone will not be the view changing comment, but to reinforce the idea that what you said is not always true and these women do exist. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Money never crossed my mind. My mom worked my whole life because she had to in order for us to survive. Being a stay at home mom wasn&amp;#39;t something I ever thought would be me because it&amp;#39;s not something I&amp;#39;m used to. So a man that made a lot of money was never something that I was specifically attracted to. I&amp;#39;m a very independent person and I always supported and protected myself and never had issue doing so. When I met my husband, the thing that attracted me to him was how kind he was to others. That is the number one thing. The way he treats others was so huge for me because I knew that would be the way he would treat me and our kids. He was also incredibly interesting and that helped. Overall, support and protection never crossed my mind. It was only about the fact that he treated me and others well. He would never say a mean thing about me and has set the standard. We don&amp;#39;t talk bad about each other and only bring each other up. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;edit: a letter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: As an environmental engineer, I give up! PLEASE CMV!","Greetings  I am an environmental engineer, with a degree in environment and land management. I have studied and dedicated my professional life to make a change on our world, to make this planet a better place for future generations and protect it from those that would exploit it for greed and short term gain.  After 15 years of working in the field I am ready to give up. The fact is most people don't give a shit about our planet and the legacy we are leaving for future generations. I have worked hard, sometimes more than 70 hours a week, to see all that I have accomplished destroyed by short sighted corporations and the uncaring government that work for them.  I have been called a useless hippy who works only to stifle profits, I have seen the depths of which government and corporations will go to fuck us all for short term gains and I have lived for many years barely breaking even and financially keeping myself afloat because most environmental jobs that aren't about exploiting the system to maximize a companies profits pays for shit.  Well now I have a wife, a son, banks who are hounding me night and day to pay back my student loans and the dream of offering a better life for my family. This week I have been offered two new career opportunity. One is to manage a non profit organisation dedicated to protecting the last vestiges of forests and wetlands around the city i live in (while paying only 13$/h). The other is for a big construction company, to make sure that it is compliant with the pathetic environmental regulations while it bulldozes over the last natural ecosystems we have (but for more money per month than I ever made in a year)  I am to give my decision next week and I am truly considering for the first time in my life to give up my principals and go work for the money. I need somebody to change my views, but I am so tired of living poor, of not being respected and of seeing all my work be for nothing.  Edit: Wow I am getting finger cramps from replying to all of these great posts (very few of them were not so great ... you know who you are!) I sincerely thank you all for contributing to this great discussion. I have made this post as a whimsical experiment... I have already discussed about my career choice with my wife and close family and I have already come to a decision considering what to do with my immediate future. I just wanted to anonymously find out what the reddit community thought about my hard decision and I have been more than happily suprised with the response. This is the essence of what makes reddit so great... Many thanks to all of you... I will continue to respond to as many comments as I can and tomorrow I will update this post with my final decision and the reasons why I chose it.     Final decision Edit: First I would like to thank you all for this awesome CMV. It went way beyond what I had ever expected and I don't think I have ever spent so much time typing since my time at university. Like I said in the previous edit, I had already reached a decision by consulting my wife, my friends and my family, but all the incredible advice and the insightful comment gave me great hope that my decision will be the right one for my career, myself and my family. So here it goes  I have decided to take the construction industry job for the following reasons:  - Right now it is an awful time to be working in the non-profit NGO, where I live. The conservative government has slashed all funding in the environment sector and the provincial government only cares about austerity. If I took the NGO job, I wouldn't even be guarantied to be able to keep it for very long if the meager funding dries out.  - I have been working in the same field, with the same people for over 15 years. I am feel enthusiastic about learning new things and working with new people. Also if I learn the inner workings of the construction industry, I may become much more efficient to enact long term meaningful changes.  - I have been living poor (well much more then most engineer do) for the past 15 and I still have some student loans to reimburse. Banks have constantly been picking at my heels and it will be quite a load of my stress, if I can finally repay then and make then STFU! Also having some form of financial stability would be great for a change.  - Although where I live, our society has quite the safety net and I am assured that my child will never lack of his basic needs whatever salary I make, It would be great to offer my family a better quality of life. Rest assured I am not someone who will have more money go to his head. By nature, I am not a great consumer and I am very likely to put most of my money aside for personal projects and even help out the NGO I had worked for and respect.  - I have dedicated my entire life to fight for the environment and that in not about to change, even if I work in a different field. Over the years I have found that enacting change from the outside of a system is next to impossible, so it will be quite interesting to see if change can be had from the inside.   - My greatest fear is that the construction job asks me to compromise to much on my value and that makes me fall into a depression. In order to prevent this scenario, I will be following the advice given by many of you. Quickly put money aside, so I can safely bail out if thing get to rough and have multiple contingency plan if ever it does.   - Finally I must admit that the money does sound attractive. I never had a job that pays so much and I never thought I would. However having grown in a wealthy (relatively speaking) family, I know first hand that money doesn't buy happiness, it just makes misery very comfortable. Since I am a woodsman and love working outdoors comforts aren't that important to me, but it's been forever since I have dreamed of visiting the different forests around the world and for the first time in my life, I may actually be able to do that (If I ever get some vacation time... a concept that is equally alien to me)   Once again many thanks to all the people who commented on my CMV post (yes even the trolls, their idiotic antics proved somewhat entertaining) I wish you all the very best of luck in your endeavours and if anyone wants to help me in my quest to make this world a better place, feel free to go out an plant a tree. In the long run it does actually make a difference. Ardaron9 out!         Tldr: CMV really worked and I no longer believe that going to work for a big construction company is a huge betrayal of my environmental values. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"CMV: I am going on Birthright soon, and I don't think I should boycott Israel.","I am going on a Birthright trip soon, and I am feeling very conflicted about going. I am pretty liberal in most ways, but I don't understand a whole lot about international politics, although I try. Obviously, I've been hearing a lot about the conflict on the West Bank, because I don't completely live under a rock. While I think that Israel does what it has to do a lot of the time, and I do think that liberal media often misrepresents Israel, I do not approve of the settlements. Some of my more educated liberal acquaintances are advocating a boycott of Israeli products and companies. They do not know I am going to go on this trip, and I am embarrassed to tell them. Is it wrong for me to go on the trip? I don't want to cancel, because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to see Israel and meet some interesting new people. But oh, the guilt. Guide me? (I may be slow to respond to comments, but I will read everything)","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to try to convince you to not go.  I am however going to try to convince you to look at it another way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In fact, I think going there and seeing the situation for yourself is probably the best thing you can do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps you should not consider it a &amp;quot;birthright&amp;quot; trip so much as an opportunity for a learning experience?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Neither side of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict is in the right.  Hamas doesn&amp;#39;t care about civilian casualties and hides their weaponry in places like churches, giving Israel little ability to try to fight them without attacking citizens at the same time.  However, most Palestinian civilians are barely above the poverty line.  There have been at least 120 deaths of innocent Palestinians in response to the deaths of three Israeli teenagers (deaths Hamas has denied involvement in, and ISIS of Iraq has been screaming bloody murder they are responsible for.).  So, obviously Israel is responding militarily and punishing civilians for the actions of a few.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also consider, Israel has built a wall that the world has not seen the likes of since the Berlin Wall.  They have consistently stolen Palestinian land through the settlements, burning olive trees as they go.  Israel has one of the strongest economies on the planet, and one of the largest and most well-run militaries worldwide.  Every single Israeli has a mandatory two years of military service, so everyone in the country is very familiar with military-grade weaponry and uses it exceptionally well.  Palestine is a freaking dirt-hole where all the weapons are home-made or smuggled into the country.  None of the Palestinians involved have had &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; training.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;None of this means that the crimes of Hamas are forgivable, they are not.  However, the Israeli response is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; over the top, and the last time I checked, &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Law_and_the_Gaza_War#Collective_punishment""&gt;punishing a civilian population for the crimes of a handful of people is considered a &lt;em&gt;war crime&lt;/em&gt; by the UN.&lt;/a&gt;  So, I still personally tend to side with Palestinians simply because while I abhor Hamas, they do not represent all of Palestine, while the Israeli government and military ostensibly &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; represent Israel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once again, I do not think you should cancel your trip, but use it as an opportunity to learn about the real issues in this part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for &amp;quot;liberal media&amp;quot; misrepresenting Israeli&amp;#39;s, &lt;a href=""http://www.intifada-palestine.com/2014/07/cnn-palestinians-want-die/""&gt;here is a video from yesterday of a CNN anchor arguing that Palestinians &amp;quot;want to die.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;  Right, sure they do.  A white male American totally knows the values of all Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not just the conflict in the west bank, though. It&amp;#39;s the entire conflict with all of Palestine for the last 50 years, constantly annexing land, &amp;#39;settling&amp;#39; on people&amp;#39;s homes, burning olive groves, displacing and killing Palestinians (you want to count how many children they&amp;#39;ve killed in the last decade?), denyng food, water, medical supplies and building materials, and generally running an apartheid state, while still playing the &amp;#39;plucky little underdog&amp;#39; card, and while guzzling down billions in US aid, while having a virtually unlimited military budget and the political backing of half the western world. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Who does that remind you of? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s right: &lt;em&gt;Dudley Dursley&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With guns. And bombs. And bulldozers. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t want to give this asshole your tourist dollars and tacit support, really you don&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A generally good rule of thumb in life is that if a country is generating refugees on a regular basis, it&amp;#39;s a shitty country that you shouldn&amp;#39;t give stuff to. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If Israel and Palestine really are as bad as each other, how come you only hear of Palestinian refugees, and never hear of Israeli ones?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is the &lt;em&gt;birthright&lt;/em&gt; of Palestinisans to continue living on their own land, in their own homes, yet Israel violates that right on a constant and ever-increasing basis. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you had been born Palestinian, how do you think you&amp;#39;d feel? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: I think that salesmen are useless middlemen striving for legitimacy in the Information Era,"I think they should be replaced with non-commission based customer service representatives in all industries who can answer pre-sales questions.  The most useless, and obsolete salesmen IMO are:  Car salesmen  Suit/Shoe/Clothing salesmen (department stores)  Appliance salesmen  Cell phone salesmen    The only salesmen I think have any legitimacy are finance and insurance salesmen, and they should instead act as consultants giving you the pros and cons of all firms in an industry, instead of represeting one firm.  I'd be much more likely to go to Joe's Insurance shop who deals with 100 insurance companies and can find the best one for my needs (having claims experience with all of them) as opposed to an Allstate rep who will knowingly sell me a bad product simply because it's by Allstate.  The fact that there are still industries where the price is left to be haggled, on a product neither party of the transaction has an intrinsic stake in (think bartering at a garage sale) is disgusting.  Google and web forums can answer everything you need to know unbiased about a product. For people too old or stupid to know how to research online, they can talk to a phone based (non commission) CSR.   EDIT: To clarify, my biggest issue is with commission based salesmen where the customer pays the commmission.  Affiliate marketing (which I participate in) involves getting a kickback from a company for selling a product. The consumer pays no extra cost if they buy it through you or directly through the the company. Your commission comes from the company as a cost of advertising.   Bottom line, every customer pays the same price for the product, and the ""salesmen"" is paid by the company.  Salesmen (cars/suits/etc) charge a different price not based on volume of purchase, or ability to pay, but on ability to negotiate and knowledge of the industry.  Salesmen make their commission off the backs of the consumer, even if their ""expertise"" is not needed. Consumers pay different amounts for the same product based on their knowledge of the industry and negotiation skills. I consider this unethical. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work in sales and there are some points I think you are missing. First off not all salesmen sell to the general public. Many sale to business. You seem to only address salesmen that sale to the public. An example of this is a sales rep.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Secondly there is a large benefit for a business to use commission based salesmen. They are far more motivated to sell you more and better product which increases revenue for their employees.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thirdly, I think you underestimate how much a salesmen can help you as a consultant. Sure there are terrible salesmen that don&amp;#39;t care about you and just want you to spend money, but in my experience the best salesmen try to fashion themselves as consultants helping you make the best decision for you. Top salesmen thrive on return customers and referrals. You have to look out for your customer to get you this. And though you can research a lot now days, salesmen generally have an inside track to information from the companies they sale and deal with many customers and get their feed back on what is quality and not. Many times in my experience a consumer will do research but actually confuse themselves more than educate. My biggest goal is to educate my clients to make a better decision no matter where they spend their money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s forget titles, your problem with with commission vs non commissioned.  Because really a CSR and a salesman have the same goal, and that&amp;#39;s to sell you product.  In a sense, both are middlemen, but in reality neither of them are.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;#39;s commission or not, a chunk of your purchase is still going to the pay cheque of the person who sold it to you.  Either the company is making it a straight percentage, or they are building into the price the average cost of the employee.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The benefit for having a commissioned salesman over a non commissioned CSR is really for the company and not for the customer.  The thinking is that a commissioned salesperson will make a greater effort to make a sale if it is directly tied to their earnings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Commissioned salespeople also tend to take more pride in the products they sell and will educate themselves about the product.  CSRs tend to do the minimum in product knowledge, while salesmen strive for maximum knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure most information is available on line, but would most people even know what information to look up.  The truth is, a good salesmen can give enough relevant information in 5 minutes, that would take the average Joe over an hour to look up on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You might not like haggling, but haggling will get you a lower price not a higher price.  If you aren&amp;#39;t haggling, you are paying the sticker price, haggling will get you below the sicker price.  A commissioned salesman will be much more likely to haggle the lower price, even going to a manager for the sake of getting a sale, while a CSR probably won&amp;#39;t care about putting in any effort to drop the price. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0

I believe the clash of civilizations is real and happening. CMV.,"I'm not exactly down with Huntington on all of his points. But in broad terms, I believe the world is divided in regions of cultural homogeneity that compete with each other for world hegemony (economical, cultural and eventually political).   [This is a map I could agree with, for example.](http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2013/286/a/6/clash_of_civilizations_world_map_by_saint_tepes-d68d0kw.png)  (*edit for clarity : I'm not familiar enough with Ethiopia and Haiti's situation here, so I would not know if they're rightfully taken apart. I mostly agree with Turkey &amp; Japan being hybrid even though it may complexify the map. I agree with Israel being a unique state.)   I'm aware that ""homogenous"" here can sound simplistic. I know that all these regions carry internal divisions, and opposing agendas, but I believe their sum of the divergences is less important than the sum of the convergences. In the end it's still about the clash.   Change my view.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an idea proposed by Samuel Huntington* originally, and was originally much less detailed than the map you gave, but the idea is the same - there are cohesive civilizational units, and world conflict appears at the borders. This is usually focused on military conflict, but you mentioned economic and cultural hegemony as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, within those blocs there are plenty of differences. Persians and Arabs have fought each other very recently (Iran-Iraq war, Saudi distrust of the Iranians, Iranian support for militant groups in Syria and Lebanon). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Within the &amp;quot;western world&amp;quot; there is competition for economic hegemony between the USA and EU (indeed, this was the primary reason the EU was brought into existence was to resist US dominance of the world economy). Within Europe itself you have vast political and cultural differences between the UK and continental Europe, or cleavages between northern and southern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Within the Orthodox world of course you have attempts of hegemony by Russia, and resentment from CIS countries like Ukraine and Georgia. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Within the East Asian world China has fought wars against both Vietnam and South Korea and has historically used Korea as a client state. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In short, the theory that most major world conflict appears between civilizations or at their frontiers is just not true - there are plenty of dimensions that require that we look at the world in smaller units of states, nations, or even subnational groups. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if you&amp;#39;re going for more cultural similarities or international political alliances, but trying to combine the two on this map makes it awkward.  Japan and south korea are much more culturally similar to each other than to vietnam, but both are more allied to the western powers than to any asian one.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Turkey is a still muslim nation, despite being more friendly to the west.  kazakhstan is also a muslem country and should be in green.  If we&amp;#39;re talking cultural, western china (Xinjiang) should be green, but if we&amp;#39;re talking political then taiwan should be blue.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Isreal is also considered a western state, since most of it&amp;#39;s population immigrated from europe, and has almost nothing in common with the surrounding states.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Culturally, Brazil should be seperate from the rest of South America, but politically, Mexico should be with the US.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite being majority christian, Ethiopia is still very similar to the african nations around it, and should probably be dark brown.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those are just the ones I know, but I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s more.  For instance, the north/south line in Africa looks kinda arbitrarily drawn, and could probably move north a few degrees.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;#39;ve pointed out a few points of contention, don&amp;#39;t you think that the issue of cultural clashing is much, much more complicated than just East vs West vs Islam vs South?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: I'm wasting four years of my life and thousands of dollars for an education that is subpar to what I could acquire myself and for a piece of paper that is taken for more than it is actually worth.,"FLUFF  For some background, I'm a computer science major.  Before that I was a music major.  I think college is a useful resource for many people who want to go into specialized occupations-- for instance, law, psychology, medicine, anthropology, teaching, etc.  There are specialized fields in which the only place with the resources to teach them is a university.  I also think that liberal arts education is a good program for these sorts of students, because it exposes them to knowledge outside of the academic tedium to which they will likely be bound to in their career--teaches people who are very interested in one subject to poke their heads up every once in a while.  BUT, college is becoming ""second high school.""  Anyone who is smart is supposed to go to college, or else they're considered subpar citizens of some sort.  There's a major for everything now--even though many subjects are not well suited to academia.    For instance, the best way to become a musician is to find a teacher [AKA better musician,] practice and work enough to eat and pay said teacher, and then practice until you can convince a better teacher to let you pay them to teach you, and then repeat until you're good enough that somebody will pay you to do music.  Musical knowledge is not behind a paywall.  Yet, so many people think that the only way to become a real musician is to go to college for it.  You don't need to go to college to be a great writer.  You don't need to go to a four-year-college to be a great business administrator, in most cases.  You don't need to go to college to be a great journalist.  A great detective.  Graphic designer.  Chef.  Electrician.  Botanist.  *Programmer.*  CRUNCH  So essentially I shouldn't be here.  But I'm here because:  A) I'm smart and apparently that's what smart people do.  B) My parents saved up and I'd feel bad if I didn't spend it on college.  C) It's really not cool to live in your parent's basement.  Especially when you're engaged.  D) No matter how good at programming I am, employers will pick someone with a college degree over me because they have no fucking idea how college or programming works.  E) Everyone says that they regret not going to college and that I will regret it too.  F) I feel guilty for hating college because I like the people here and because I'm supposed to like college if I'm intelligent.  G) I've never had a real job.  H) *** I'm a woman.  I don't plan to have kids.  As a woman, not going to college hurts my jobs chances a lot more than if I were a man.  Also, since I don't plan to have kids, not going to college is seen as being a lazy ass.  Reasons I shouldn't be here:  A) The languages I'm learning will likely be outdated or irrelevent by the time I graduate.   B) ""Liberal Arts Education"" is slowing down my learning of programming and squashing my natural love of learning by forcing me to try to attain a certain GPA.  (""I can't learn chemistry for all the academics that's getting thrown at me"" is something I've lamented about at least twice every week since the beginning of this semester. This semester I learned to hate chemistry, when I used to love it, and that's about it.)  C) The education I'm receiving here is subpar to what I can easily achieve on the internet for free--in fact, it inhibits my learning abilities because it forces me to learn inside a box, or be punished.  D) The academia assume that the students are mindless plebeians that must be coerced into learning. (We're given grades because it is assumed that we must be explicitly motivated since we apparently lack implicit motivation.)   E) The students here are taught to be arrogant and to feel entitled without having earned any actual skills.  F) For all the pain and money, the rise in my chances of getting a job after graduating is not nearly high enough.  G) I want to take charge of my own fucking education and make the world a better place and move and shake some shit up.  Not shackle myself to a four year education plan and then shackle myself to endless debt and to a job that I hate because I'm afraid I won't have the money to pay the debt if I pursue something I enjoy.   And also I hate this place.    Fight.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to look at your assertion that you would be able to teach yourself or learn what you need to know for free. The problem is, the most valuable things you learn from college are going to be the things that you probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to teach yourself. An example: when I was a tutor at college, I heard complaints about the liberal arts education all the time. It was usually from math, science, computer science, etc, students who were really good at one thing: their major subject. They resented the fact that they had to take one or two writing classes in order to get their degree. The problem? The STEM folks who complained about liberal arts education were all terrible at writing. So bad, in fact, that they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to function in the workplace because their writing was incomprehensible. I had several math and science professors complain to me that their students didn&amp;#39;t understand that there are so many other skills they need to learn in order to be successful: writing, teamwork, problem solving, awareness of basic facts about history, politics, etc.  It seems to me that the broad liberal arts education is designed with the idea that every student should graduate with basic skills and understanding in multiple areas so that they will be more flexible and successful. So, you may not need to go to college to learn the basics of botany, but any &lt;em&gt;botanist&lt;/em&gt; will tell you that, to succeed in that career, you need at least an undergraduate degree and probably a masters or doctorate. Also, having been both a student and an instructor, I can tell you that academics don&amp;#39;t think students are mindless plebeians. They didn&amp;#39;t get into this business to simply reward and punish students for jumping through hoops, but if a student is only thinking about a class in terms of reward and punishment, and shows no interest in learning the material because the material is important or interesting, they won&amp;#39;t expend energy trying to change your view. If you go into a class thinking the thing that matters is getting an A, and you don&amp;#39;t care about the material, then you are the one putting yourself in a box.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: A liberal arts education is trying to take you out of the box you are already putting yourself in. Just teaching yourself the things that are easy for you to learn and ignoring the hard stuff isn&amp;#39;t going to help you in the long run. Also, you may consider yourself &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; now, but if you don&amp;#39;t challenge yourself by stepping out of your box, you won&amp;#39;t be able to keep up with the people who do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like it&amp;#39;s November, you&amp;#39;re a sophomore or junior, your social life isn&amp;#39;t great right now, your classes aren&amp;#39;t as exciting as a month ago but the material, unfortunately, still has to be learned, and you&amp;#39;re sitting in your dorm room pissed off that everybody  but you is having fun.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now imagine the same thing is happening, but you also have to get up in the morning and find a way to make money and pursue your career. That&amp;#39;s roughly what your life would be like if you quit school. I would posit that the most valuable thing about college for a young person such as yourself is the structure. If anything, having classes you must attend at least gets you out of bed when you can&amp;#39;t make yourself turn the Netflix off because you have focus problems - these problems won&amp;#39;t magically go away, by the way, if you decide to Steve Jobs it. Like, people who actually have something better to do than go to college are doing that thing. It&amp;#39;s no use complaining if you don&amp;#39;t have a practicable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Think of your life at college as similar to solving a complex applied problem. In college, you have professors to help you get started and guide you through your thought processes, peers to share your misery with, and deadlines to make sure that you actually do the work. In the real world, you are expected to look at the problem and develop a solution with the tools you have; if your solution isn&amp;#39;t good enough or you don&amp;#39;t get it done on time, well, sorry, somebody else is getting paid today. In college, similar mechanisms are in place that, whilst they can&amp;#39;t make you happy, can make sure that you&amp;#39;re not totally adrift. That&amp;#39;s why we have structured environments for young people, so we can build up our &amp;quot;toolbox&amp;quot; of coping mechanisms, so to say. College is your last stop before total independence, which is a very scary place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I believe that you should be allowed to drive at whatever speed you wish as long as you aren't driving recklessly or under extenuating circumstances CMV,"I think that if you feel comfortable driving 80 mph or 40 mph you should be allowed to do so, as long as you aren't in a school or work zone, etc. because there are a lot more risks in those areas. I think when you're comfortable driving you will be a better driver, and if you aren't worrying about the speed limit or cops you are going to be more comfortable.   However, I think that you should only be allowed to drive at whatever speed you wish as long as you aren't driving recklessly. If you're weaving in and out of traffic at 90, you probably shouldn't be allowed to go 90, but if you just stay in the fast lane and pass the occasional person I don't think there is a problem.

Especially when there is a certain amount of pressure from the task that pushes my body on or into the seat or rubs it against it. No, thank you.

The term 'Reverse racism' is racist. CMV.,"I had a heated ideological debate last night with 2 sociologists and a feminist over the definition of 'racism'.    The way I understand it, racism is simply race-based discrimination. If you make a statement that generalizes all members of a certain race or singles them out in a negative way, you're being racist regardless of which race you make the statement about.    The way they argued it is that racism is no longer racism if it's directed at the racial group in power aka white people. This is a paradox. They are discriminating against a specific race to redefine the term, 'racism', manifesting the new term, 'reverse racism', to address racial discrimination against white people. By doing this, they reinscribe the very meaning of racism that I claim to be true as they are discriminating against a group of people based on their race.    Help me wrap my head around how sociologists think they can redefine a term by employing that term.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people think of racism as a thing individuals believe: the KKK is racist or your uncle is racist. But in fact, it generally makes more sense to think of racism as a property of an entire society. I&amp;#39;d like to make the analogy to communism: sure, individuals can be communist, but what we really care about are communist countries, not individual communists.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This structural racism always has the majority race at the top. Given that, there&amp;#39;s no such thing as structural reverse racism, because the system simply isn&amp;#39;t set up that way. An individual black person can still be personally racist against white people, but for the most part, who cares? They don&amp;#39;t have enough power to make that belief any more than an annoyance for white people at best because society is structured to make sure white people are on top.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of other &amp;quot;isms&amp;quot; you&amp;#39;re familiar with: Communism, capitalism, socialism, existentialism: the suffix typically describes a system of thought. From a strict sociological definition, the sociologists and feminists are correct: racism only reflects an ideological system whereby the privileged race is believed to be in this position because they are stronger or better than the other races. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not the end of the discussion though: word definitions are informed by their etymology, but they&amp;#39;re ultimately defined by their usage. Ask the average person on the street to define racism and you&amp;#39;ll get the colloquial definition you use: discriminating against a group of people based on their race.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So in a way, you&amp;#39;re both right. However, as in all sciences, I tend to stick to the experts when talking about topics in an academic way. If I were talking about biology, and a botanist corrected me when I said &amp;quot;tomatoes aren&amp;#39;t vegetables, they&amp;#39;re fruits&amp;quot; I would listen to the botanist. So ultimately, while racism can be seen by any individual act of prejudice, when studying the effect of this prejudice on a society, the only way to look at it is at that societal level described by your friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"I believe GoneWild Plus is wrong because it tells women that it's okay to be fat and unhealthy, and that GoldWild Curvy is just a place for fat women who can't accept that they're overweight. CMV.","For anyone not familiar with the subreddits, /r/gonewildplus is pretty much /r/gonewild for overweight women to show off their bodies to the internet. /r/gonewildcurvy is essentially the same thing, expect for women who consider themselves ""curvy"" instead of fat. Usually, women on that subreddit belong in GW Plus but come off as ""in denial"" about their own weight. Granted, some of them would fit in just fine in regular Gone Wild. However, it doesn't seem too common.  Moving on:   The entire idea of GW Plus is to glorify unhealthy, overweight female bodies. This teaches these women that ""there's nothing wrong with being fat"", ""they're perfect just the way they are"", etc. It can discourage them from bothering to lose weight, and there's nothing ""okay"" with being unhealthy if you have the means to change it. With GW Curvy, it seems like a similar concept. Create a place for overweight women to show off their naked bodies, and call it something that sounds prettier (curvy) so they don't feel bad about themselves. Although in this case, it's more ""disguising the truth"" rather than ""making women feel content with the truth"". Neither one seems right to me. CMV.

Why do people who are overweight constantly need to feel bad about themselves?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would contend that many people who are overweight are that way because they feel bad about their body image and lead themselves to overeating as a coping technique.

CMV: TES is a fun series but getting really into the lore won't enhance my experience.,"[Some](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Withershins_\(Book\)) of the books are pretty [enjoyable](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Chance%27s_Folly) or just [silly](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/ABCs_for_Barbarians) and knowing a little bit about the relevant culture can be useful (more so in Morrowind than Oblivion or Skyrim) but some people get waaaay into it.  How does knowing about TES cosmology, CHIM (besides being used as a hand-waving explanation) or the biography of an insane king make *my* game playing experience more enjoyable?  It sort of seems a bit pointless.   Plus where do the lovely people of /r/TESlore get all this info?  Is *everything* they talk about found in books or dialogue or is there some EU shit I'm not aware of?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the abstract arguments have largely been covered, so I&amp;#39;ll get specific. Here are three examples of how the lore has changed my experience of skyrim. First, knowledge of the hist has deeply influenced how I play and view argonians. Rather than playing an argonian from cyrodiil, who was raised in that culture, I find myself playing an immigrant from the black marsh. Note how interesting Madesi, in Riften becomes when we consider how unique his experience must be. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Second, look at the Mage&amp;#39;s guild questline. If you don&amp;#39;t know about the altmer beliefs regarding mundus, Ancano&amp;#39;s behavior seems insane. His support from another thalmor agent is inexplicable. (Note that the thalmor attempt to eliminate talos worship changes importance drastically when you know he is convection 2.0).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, CHIM itself has a mirror that can really toss you for a loop. Zero-summing. The realization that I ARE ALL WE but also I AM NOT. Without knowledge of this coin and man&amp;#39;s place in the dream, the disintegration of Septimus Signus is a betrayal by Hermaus Mora. With that knowledge, it becomes an event of serious metaphysical implications. And the tension before reading the Oghma Infinium is heightened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suppose it depends how you play the games. You could argue that knowledge of certain lore will help you roleplay better. If you know that there&amp;#39;s historical animosity between certain groups or certain people, it might influence the way you decide to play, thus making for a richer RPG experience. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To use an example from a different game series, and I will avoid spoilers as much as I can, in Dragon Age: Origins, if you play as a human noble, a certain character betrays you. If you dig around, you find that there&amp;#39;s actually a historical reason why he resents your family. That&amp;#39;s information that you can only find if you dig around in the lore, read the books or ask questions of certain people. Does it make the game BETTER? Not really.

I believe that being Pro-Choice makes you Pro-Abortion. CMV,"In almost any thread or conversation about ProChoice vs ProLife, a ProChoice person will say that ""No one's ProAbortion"" or ""I personally wouldn't get an abortion but I think it should be a choice.""   I honestly have no idea how this position makes any sense. Even though I'm 100% ProLife, I can follow the logic of a person who admits to being Pro-Abortion and even (in a sense) respect that that is their opinion. I just cannot grasp why other people always call it ""Pro-Choice"" when in the end it boils down to Pro-Abortion.  Edit: It's not so much an argument about labels as much as positions. How can someone personally be against abortion but identify themselves as prochoice? is a bit more what i mean i suppose.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a question of what the legal consequences should be for abortion. There is a valid position that holds &amp;quot;Abortion is wrong, but we shouldn&amp;#39;t jail poor, desperate women for having one. Abortion should be safe, legal, and rare.&amp;quot; I think this position is rooted in acknowledging what a grey area it is for many people. By the time a fetus is 8 months in, it&amp;#39;s perfectly viable and ending the pregnancy seems to many people to be equivalent to murder (though some religions hold that ensoulment occurs at the moment of birth, and not before, so maybe a view from that quarter would be different). On the other hand, many people do not consider a fertilized egg to be a full human. Or a small number of unspecialized cells. Or a fetus 4 weeks in to pregnancy with no brain or heart. There is no clear demarcation of &amp;quot;this entity is now a full human being&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s a gradual spectrum, and reasonable people can disagree with where to draw a line. The pro-choice position lets people draw the line in any place for themselves while acknowledging that they could be wrong. The pro-life position is willing to use the force of law to punish those that think it should be drawn later or in different circumstances than their own preferences. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I personally don&amp;#39;t understand the pro-life position that is also in favor of exceptions in the case of abortion. If the fetus is a full person with all human rights, those are not suspended just because of the person&amp;#39;s origins. The idea of jailing a rape victim for an abortion is abhorrent to many people, though, so the pro-life movement mostly does not seem to demand ideological consistency on this point (which is fine with me, since I&amp;#39;m pro-choice anyway).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, the point is pro-choice does not always equal pro-abortion. There exist many people that abhor abortion but just don&amp;#39;t want to use the government to punish people for deciding a thorny issue in a different way than them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that it&amp;#39;s sometimes a problem of people talking past one another, but it may be that you&amp;#39;re working with terms rather than positions.  People who advocate for a &amp;#39;pro-choice&amp;#39; position often take that line that women have a legal and moral right over their own bodies.  This is not incompatible with the view that it&amp;#39;s sometimes awful to abort a fetus, especially (for example) if it&amp;#39;s a late-term abortion.  So while someone may be pro-choice (&amp;#39;you have the right to an abortion&amp;#39;) they may not be &amp;#39;pro-abortion&amp;#39; (&amp;#39;you have the right to an abortion but I don&amp;#39;t want you to do it&amp;#39;).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Think of it in terms of free speech: I may agree that you have a right to freedom of speech, and that it&amp;#39;s good to exercise your rights, but also find what you have to say repugnant and bad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: It is morally and practically unjustifiable to join the Stormcloaks. (Spoilers),"I am a huge fan of Skyrim's civil war storyline because both sides are somewhat morally ambiguous, leaving it to each player to determine which side is worth joining. I wish to argue that when one looks at the situation as a whole, the Imperial Legion is objectively the lighter shade of grey.  Admittedly, I have had a pro-Imperial bias since before I first started playing Skyrim. Based on my experiences in both Morrowind (especially so) and Oblivion, the Cyrodiilic Empire has always seemed like a very nice place to be, and so I've always been an Imperial loyalist. I was surprised that joining the rebels was even an option.  But now, after having analyzed the backgrounds and motivations of both sides, I'm even more of an Imperial loyalist than ever. This is because of the following reasons.  **1. A united Empire would be a stronger bulwark against Dominion aggression. Also, the Empire is generally good for Skyrim.**  This should be fairly obvious. If Skyrim was to secede from the Empire, then High Rock would be cut off from Cyrodiil, and could very well secede in turn. Hammerfell was already kicked out of the Empire, and whatever is left of Morrowind that has not been destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vvardenfell lies under the de facto control of the Kingdom of Argonia. (**EDIT** Argonia was actually kicked out of Morrowind due to the efforts of House Redoran.) In the event of a successful Stormcloak rebellion, the Dominion would be able to destroy the nations of men piecemeal.  Of course, a quick and decisive victory for the rebels is not quite optimal for the Thalmor; they would prefer that both sides bleed one another out (and don't forget that Ulfric is a Thalmor asset of a sort). But if they cannot have that, I'm sure that they would prefer to take on a bunch of smaller human kingdoms than one larger human Empire. Of course, for any of those who actually like the Dominion, this is a wonderful reason to join the Stormcloaks.  There is also the matter of trade and mutual benefit. Jarl Balgruuf says as much. Skyrim gets to benefit from the rich lands to the south, and in exchange Cyrodiil gets the protection of some of the best warriors on Tamriel.  **2. Ulfric's killing of King Toryyg sets a dangerous precedent.**  As Uncle Alvor put it:  &gt;Once the jarls start killing each other, we're back to the bad old days.  Ulfric's claim on rulership of Skyrim boils down to ""might begets right"". ""Well no kidding, that's how rebellions work,"" some of you might be saying. But Ulfric's point in killing the king was that leadership comes from individual martial prowess. No king who cannot beat challengers in single combat is fit to rule. Such an attitude does not belong in any civilized society, because it is hazardous to stability. What's to stop Skyrim from falling into civil war again in a generation if someone decides that he doesn't like Ulfric's successor?  It would have been different if Ulfric had asked Toryyg to declare independence from the Empire. Toryyg would have seriously considered it, and if he had agreed, then this point would be moot. As events turned out the way that they did, I'm convinced that Ulfric's rebellion is at least partially motivated by his own personal ambition: he still would not have wanted to be a vassal to Toryyg.  There are other points to be made about the Great War, the White-Gold Concordat, the release of Hammerfell, and the Markarth Incident, but I'll address those if they come up. So, rebel scum^^^I'm ^^^sorry , CMV if you can.  **EDIT**  First Delta goes to /u/Rdmknowledge. I've enjoyed having this discussion with all of you about one of my most beloved games. But I'm tired now, and I'll be back tomorrow. Feel free to continue this discussion.  ^^^Talos ^^^guide ^^^you ^^^all.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you have acknowledged, the Aldmeri Dominion is the true threat (not just to Skyrim, but to the world), but your belief in the Empire&amp;#39;s ability to meet that threat (as it currently stands) seems unsupported. The Empire has already been beaten: their continued existence is due to last minute heroics and the cost of most of their autonomy. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Aldmeri agents operate openly within the Empire&amp;#39;s borders, the people of the Empire face restrictions on their freedoms which are dictated by their enemies and the Empire is losing control of their outlying provinces one by one. What is left of their government is a mess of corruption, political infighting and assassinations. What faction within the Empire is capable of rebuilding armies sufficient to push back the Aldmeri while under their watchful eye? They cannot even protect their own emperor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the specific destruction of mankind is not the end goal of the Dominion. Rather, to unmake creation, they need only control/destroy the remaining Towers of the World. Rejection of the Talos mythos is also a core necessity of the Aldmeri plan to unmake creation, as the addition of Talos to the mythic &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/101dwz/convention_20/""&gt;reinforces the wheel of convention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thus, by supporting the Stormcloaks and ending the civil war as quickly as possible, several important actions are taken:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A) The Aldmeri lose control of the Tower in Skyrim, Snow-throat. Note that there is speculation this Tower has already been lost, leaving only Talos supporting Mundus.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;B) Skyrim&amp;#39;s people can openly worship Talos, especially as a continued act of defiance against the Aldmeri who attempted to stop them. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;C) The Aldmeri can no longer operate openly in Skyrim, and thus their intelligence gathering is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;D) Skyrim with a Dragonborn was the seed for the Empire&amp;#39;s original rise to strength and the founding of the third era.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Point (D), above, is especially poignant in the Elder Scrolls universe, as the process of &lt;a href=""http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Mantling""&gt;mantling&lt;/a&gt; is the method by which Tiber Septim ascended to godhood as Talos in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In regards to your second point, the sad fact is that Skyrim is already in open civil war, so the &amp;quot;bad old days&amp;quot; are already returned. Not to mention that challenge by combat is still largely considered an honorable tradition. If anything, it paves the possibility for an early exit of Ulfric, which would be especially fortuitous were the Dragonborn to be interested in the job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;A united Empire would be a stronger bulwark against Dominion aggression. Also, the Empire is generally good for Skyrim.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But clearly the Empire is not united as it appeared to be.  If it were this dissent for it wouldn&amp;#39;t have started in the first place.   There is only one party to blame when it comes to this scenario and that is leadership. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This should be fairly obvious. If Skyrim was to secede from the Empire, then High Rock would be cut off from Cyrodiil, and could very well secede in turn. Hammerfell was already kicked out of the Empire, and whatever is left of Morrowind that has not been destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vvardenfell lies under the de facto control of the Kingdom of Argonia. In the event of a successful Stormcloak rebellion, the Dominion would be able to destroy the nations of men piecemeal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But at-least this would actually involve fighting instead of having a puppet government.  Wouldn&amp;#39;t you rather go down fighting than submit to this?  Just try to imagine this in a real world terms imagine the government of the nation you are in is overthrown by a foreign power and has occupational forces (which you see all over Skyrim) in your lands  with your new government giving into any and all demands.  Would you really side with that?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, a quick and decisive victory for the rebels is not quite optimal for the Thalmor; they would prefer that both sides bleed one another out (and don&amp;#39;t forget that Ulfric is a Thalmor asset of a sort). But if they cannot have that, I&amp;#39;m sure that they would prefer to take on a bunch of smaller human kingdoms than one larger human Empire. Of course, for any of those who actually like the Dominion, this is a wonderful reason to join the Stormcloaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With the puppet government installed and under their thumb the rebellion only stands to hurt them in the end.  If they wanted to murder all humans they would have simply continued their crusade as they were clearly winning to begin with.   Instead the human races are being beaten into submission and it&amp;#39;s sicking that other humans are taking part in it.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is also the matter of trade and mutual benefit. Jarl Balgruuf says as much. Skyrim gets to benefit from the rich lands to the south, and in exchange Cyrodiil gets the protection of some of the best warriors on Tamriel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The average citizen in Skyrim is not very wealthy and do not have much to show for  so this only benefits those already wealthy which is a minority of the population.   Even if you were one of those wealthy people would you feel right selling out everyone&amp;#39;s freedom to continue access to luxury goods?   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ulfric&amp;#39;s claim on rulership of Skyrim boils down to &amp;quot;might begets right&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Well no kidding, that&amp;#39;s how rebellions work,&amp;quot; some of you might be saying.

What&amp;#39;s to stop Skyrim from falling into civil war again in a generation if someone decides that he doesn&amp;#39;t like Ulfric&amp;#39;s successor?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Can you give any realistic alternative Ulfric had?   Even if Ulfric had somehow peacefully managed to convince several Jarls to switch to his side without him raising a sword for his own cause this would have still lead to the same bloodshed.   Would you follow a man that isn&amp;#39;t willing to fight for what he believes in while sending you out to do tasks? Ulfric&amp;#39;s successor could be voted on democratically by the other Jarls which is the proper tradition.   We are also assuming that Ulfric wouldn&amp;#39;t be willing to put that vote up after the civil war if that was asked of him obviously he would win the vote and this would only further secure his right to the claim.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would have been different if Ulfric had asked Toryyg to declare independence from the Empire. Toryyg would have seriously considered it, and if he had agreed, then this point would be moot. As events turned out the way that they did, I&amp;#39;m convinced that Ulfric&amp;#39;s rebellion is at least partially motivated by his own personal ambition: he still would not have wanted to be a vassal to Toryyg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Toryyg was a puppet that was pro-empire  and not even properly elected.    The Empire also lies on the account of what happened in this scenario.  They accused Ulfric of l doing a shout that literally ripped Toryyg apart.  However we know that Ulfric lacks that amount of power to do the shouts  and Ulfric himself is both honest and humble on the subject saying he did it as  a method of knocking Toryyg  down to deliver the final blow.   Since Ulfric told the truth about that account it makes much more sense that Toryyg accepted this duel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, I am not going to say that the Stormcloaks are perfect because they aren&amp;#39;t  they make bad choices too and are often emotional rather than rational.  Race is a big subject in such.   But those issues can be dealt with in time where as the Empire is under a boot and doesn&amp;#39;t have the freedom to change.  The Stormcloaks at-least have hope.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last point I will make before awaiting your response is if we are assuming the Dovahkiin is siding with the Stormcloaks  they have the most powerful being on the planet on their side.  No one living person in Tamriel and perhaps all of Nirn can honestly boast of greater exploits.   He/she has the ability to clearly influence the war not just on the battlefield itself but because they are a hero who saved the world and that is something they can get behind.    The rebellion wouldn&amp;#39;t stop at Skyrim it would reach all over and the Empire the true Empire not the boot lickers we have now would rise like a phoenix out of the ashes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If we were to instead view the Dovahkiin as pro-Empire the Empire has no desire for another great war and grown content in being a puppet and keeping all their pitiful titles and riches.   The  Dovahkiin  is a oppressor in this scenario.   I would also like to note where did  Titus II  flee to when Cyrodiil fell?  Skyrim,   where did he get his reinforcements that captured it back?  Skyrim.    The Aldmeri Dominion fear Skyrim, as they do Hammerfell which they failed to conquer.  Titus cowardly surrendered in a war he would have won.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: Surplus Value Theorem is definitive proof that capitalism is an inefficient system.,"As I understand it, and crudely explained, SVT says that in an economic system that lets people hire other people for labour, waste has to be produced in order for the system to function.  Example: Consider a society of 101 people: 100 workers and 1 boss. The boss owns the factory where the workers work, and they produce, say, MLP dolls that everyone wants to buy. The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces, and a worker produces 1 doll a day. At the end of the day, the boss has 100 dolls, worth £1000 and has paid out £500. Wanting to make a profit on the dolls, the boss then sells the dolls for £10 each. She is now trying to sell £1000 worth of dolls, but the only people available to sell to are the workers, who's total funds are £500. No matter how they rearrange the money between them, they will be unable to buy more than £500 worth of the dolls, and so the rest are waste inherent to the system and a direct result of the boss wanting to make profit.  This example then scales up to the whole world when you throw in multiple bosses and lots more workers but the basic idea is the same: if each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce so that their boss can profit, then items that cannot be sold must still be produced and thrown away.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Absent price controls, profit maximizing behavior and competition will drive prices towards what the consumer values the item.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The main problem is that this would not scale up to the real world or to a more realistic scenario. The amount of money in the economy will be more than any one good. People can choose to buy or not buy based on the price. Price and supply will react to demand, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The boss pays each of her workers £5 for each doll that the worker produces&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most people aren&amp;#39;t paid on commission, so this isn&amp;#39;t really a good example, but I think I get where you&amp;#39;re going with it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;if each worker is being paid less than the price of the things they produce&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the money doesn&amp;#39;t just disappear.  For one thing, you&amp;#39;re neglecting the janitor who is necessary to keep the factory functioning (and presumably gets paid) but doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;produce&amp;quot; anything.  You&amp;#39;re also neglecting that when this system scales up you need to include the boss buying things.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since whatever profit the boss makes goes back into the system as they spend money, there should be at all times enough money in the system to cover the value of what it produced.  This value may not be the price being charged for the thing, and that&amp;#39;s where supply and demand are involved.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to deny that sometimes (or a lot of the time) the boss just hoards their extra money and doesn&amp;#39;t re-inject it, but that&amp;#39;s more a failure of the system than the system itself.  The same goes for when something is priced above its market value, it won&amp;#39;t sell and will be waste, but that&amp;#39;s because the seller overpriced it, not because it was doomed to be waste as soon as it was made.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No ideal system is really going to be inefficient, its the real ones that have problems.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you mean to say that real-life capitalism is inefficient, then no one is going to dispute you, but I will point out that it&amp;#39;s the most efficient real system we have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I think no one deserves more than $2 million annual income. CMV,"It's simple. I think society is allows people to get away with colossal gluttony way too often. CEOs make millions a year, music artists even more so. It's just a massive cabal of rich people getting richer. Money = More Money for them, this shouldn't be true for people who make $2 million or more. Honestly, there are a lot of factors that go into it, such as how can measure merit, a lot of rich people donate to charities, freedom etc. I'm willing to go into depth if anyone wants too.  Basically, we should develop so sort of salary gap set around $2 Million for the current inflation of this generation. No one deserves more than $2,000,000 a year as salary after taxes and liabilities.  EDIT:  **WALL OF TEXT INCOMING**  I just reached came back from uni and I've been trying to sift through all of the comments during my one hour commute but comments are just coming by the dozens so it's hard for me to keep up. Therefore, I'll present my founding principles, go into details and what not. I suggest arguing my founding arguments before proceeding to my corollary first. If you agree with my founding view then you can proceed to dismantle branching views.  Firstly, my view is that mankind follows a hybrid of Machiavellian and Thomas Hobbes state of nature which I will do injustice by merely summing up as that human are purely selfish and seekers of powers without true regard for the benefit of society. Government is an absolutely necessary in this worldview, thus I am not afraid, like some people are, to impose strict government regulation in certain areas of the economy. Of course, all in reasonable and studied restraint.  The number of $2,000,000 income cap was **indeed** arbitrary but I as I sort of hinted at in my original post; the cap is based off many factors which many of you have generously pointed out. That is why the cap should be under careful scrutiny with all of the relevant data of the present economy so that the most effective cap is reached.  As /u/obijuanvaldez pointed out that transparency and efficiency is a couple of factors that must be taken into consideration, however, this is more of a political/technological problem which should be tackled under any archetype. My view is not restricted to only USA but any government. A government will always be corrupt unless it's *sufficiently* transparent and *maximally* efficient. This is the ultimate government in my view and this is one of my founding principles. In a government which transparency and efficiency are at it's apex, it's not a stretch to consider that they are capable of gathering and redistributed **excess** wealth.  Now, what is **excess** wealth? and who says I don't **deserve** it? This is where I get a bit more strict that most people. This is a delicate issue that is quite subjective in some areas which I wager that should also be constant revision like any important machinery should be. Freedom because dangerously close to be lost, but honestly, in what government are we perfectly free? I would gladly sacrifice my freedom to be ridiculously affluent if it means that the government will redistribute my excess wealth to the betterment of society as a whole, which  an efficient government will be able to do. But apparently most people do not think that like that, they need incentives in order to seek improve their ventures. ""What's the point of finding the cure to an obscure disease if I already found a cure another lethal disease and make $2m annually?"" This is a problem of character in my subjective opinion. **No one should be seek monetary excess as a sign of ""success"" or ""incentive"".** I don't I phrased that properly as I am not very talented like some of you are in expressing my ideas explicitly. In other words, in a transparent and efficient society we should working for the sake of pleasure and survival. **NOT** some ethereal concept of value in a piece of paper or numbers on a screen. Capping the annual income at $2m **WITH** education on ethical and moral duties will help deconstruct this ""get money, get b*tches"" philosophy that has thoroughly pervaded human civilization since Catal Hyuuk. We currently live in a dog eat dog world; it's to put a leash on these dogs. All humans deserve to live with specific exceptions but I digress. We as ones who are alive and have the financial stability to survive should make it easier for others to survive which then will turn around to then help us survive.   I was going to type much more and detailed but after review I realized I'm not nearly as clear I decided to be perhaps it's because my headache has escalated to quasi-migraine. So I'm going to stop here and just state very succinctly my view in short excerpts of ideas. Perhaps I should have done that in the beginning.  * Humans are selfish and need proper government*  * Somehow find a way to prevent selfishness or at least mitigate it. * Convert selfishness through education and progress into prosperity of all  As of right now the forefront runner are the ""brain drain"" I see the problem in the current world where companies will migrate to other countries where they rule the humans there.

Companies/musicians/actors etc would simply relocate to a country that does allow for more than $2 million in income.

"I don't really agree with Richard Dawkins's ""meme theory"". CMV.","In Chapter 11 of *The Selfish Gene*, Richard Dawkins introduces us to the idea of *memes*.  Dawkins suggests that these *memes* are like the genes in the primordial soup of human culture. This means that they are self-replicating cultural ideas (tunes, phrases, methods, etc.).  Dawkins posits the existence of these *memes* in order to give us an explanation (via mechanisms that were well-established earlier in the book when talking about genes) of why humans are ""special"" in comparison to other species. We have culture, and this culture provides the primordial soup in which memes replicate.  The view sounds attractive because it allows us humans to carry on thinking of ourselves as ""better"" than other species without ever leaving behind the idea of complexity arising only through evolution by natural selection. We get to have it ""both ways"".  But the idea breaks down for me due to a few things. A couple of them are excerpts from Dawkins himself where he expresses some doubt (page numbers taken from the 30th anniversary paperback edition):  **1. Page 193:**  &gt; The survival value of the God meme in the meme pool results from its great psychological appeal. It provides of superficially plausible answer to deep and troubling questions about existence.  &gt; ...  &gt; Some of my colleagues have suggested to me that this account of the survival value of the god meme begs the question. In the last analysis they wish always to go back to 'biological advantage'. To them it is not good enough to say that the idea of a god has 'great psychological appeal'. They want to know *why* it has great psychological appeal. Psychological appeal means appeal to brains, and brains are shaped by natural selection of genes in gene-pools. they want to find some way in which having a brain like that improves gene survival.  **2. Page 194-5**  &gt; This brings me to the third general quality of successful replicators: copying-fidelity. Here I must admit that I am on shaky ground. At first sight it looks as if memes are not high-fidelity replicators at all. Every time a scientist hears an idea and passes it on to somebody else, he is likely to change it somewhat. I have made no secret of my debt in this book to the ideas of R. L. Trivers. Yet I have not repeated them in his own words. I have twisted them 'round for my own purposes, changing the emphasis, blending them with ideas of my own and of other people. The memes are being passed on to you in altered form. This looks quite unlike the particulate, all-or-nothing quality of gene transmission. It looks as though meme transmission is subject to continuous mutation, and also to blending.  I feel as if this lack of copying-fidelity combined with the worries of Dawkins's colleagues expressed on page 193 gives us too much doubt for this theory of *memes*.  Besides this lack of high fidelity in copying, we should also consider why these *memes* have merit in the first place. They (probably) have merit to us because they assist the replication of our genes. Now, I'm not saying that just because the replication of memes depends on the replication of genes, it means that memes automatically shouldn't be considered replicators. Two different selfish replicators can have a mutual relationship.  I don't think Dawkins is necessarily wrong when he says that our genes' survival machines (namely our bodies) provide the primordial soup in which memes can replicate. This idea seems to be explained well enough in the book. However, I just don't think we've *seen* enough evidence that these memes are actually replicating, let alone for *their own good*, the way genes replicate.  My personal gripe with the meme theory ultimately boils down to the questions that arise when we try to decide what counts as ""one meme"". For instance, when we consider an idea in science, we might say that the specific language used by the discoverer to express the idea is somewhat irrelevant. The language is a vehicle for the idea to merely be passed to the next generation. It's the unexpressed ""idea"" that is competing with others for brain space, and the language one expresses it in is a secondary feature.... But, you see, it's *not* a secondary feature. Not really. The survival of the meme depends on how well one generation can express it to the next. The language skills and whatnot of one generation determines how well the ""meme"" will do... it's not all up to the meme just to replicate itself. I think Dawkins is contradicting himself a bit here.  Dawkins defines one gene as ""one replicator"" or ""one unit of natural selection"", which allows him not to have to deal with the specifics of whether a certain gene ""for"" a trait is really one gene or not. He writes the definition he likes and then says that one gene is whatever the unit is which performs that function. This seems plausible to me when talking about genes but not with memes.  If we are to judge what ""counts"" as a meme, we have to admit that it's a bit fuzzy when it comes to certain musical and scientific ideas. Every generation of memes is going to be drastically twisted and altered from the original form, maybe sometimes not even fully recognizable to all as a form of the ""old meme"". But what determines how much it is ""okay"" for a meme to differ from its parent generations? It seems the answer is that it's ""okay"" for a meme to be different as long as we still like it and will still pass it down... for the good of the survival of our own genes. It feels wrong to say that memes are self-replicating units if their survival depends on so much more than longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity as we've seen with genes. Instead of saying that memes are ""competing"" for brain space, it seems that humans are ""competing"" for that which will help the survival of our genes. And since we are highly evolved, these resources include ideas and knowledge of certain methods as well.  tl;dr -- I disagree with the meme theory of Dawkins based on the idea that we don't have enough conceptual evidence to say that memes are really units of natural selection or units with any sort of copying-fidelity that we find in genes. The survival of a meme does not depend merely on its ability to copy itself. I have posted relevant quotes from *The Selfish Gene* above, but one will probably have to have read the book in order to come up with a forceful rebuttal.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The view sounds attractive because it allows us humans to carry on thinking of ourselves as &amp;quot;better&amp;quot; than other species without ever leaving behind the idea of complexity arising only through evolution by natural selection. We get to have it &amp;quot;both ways&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Small problem with this: an idea being unattractive or attractive has no bearing on it being true whatsoever. Darwinian-style evolution is an attractive idea to me, that doesn&amp;#39;t make it true or false. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not really. The survival of the meme depends on how well one generation can express it to the next. The language skills and whatnot of one generation determines how well the &amp;quot;meme&amp;quot; will do... it&amp;#39;s not all up to the meme just to replicate itself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Genes are subject to this as well. The passage of my genes depends on my ability to perform well and my ability to convey my worth as a human being to another human being with whom I want to copulate. (Worst description of dating ever.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, you can argue that genes can fight back by making me a more capable human being, but a lot of dating is personality, which seems more a product of that person&amp;#39;s experiences than their genes. I&amp;#39;m not the same person I was a year ago, or a year before that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Memes can also fight back in a roughly equivalent way by being easy to describe.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If I am to form a good answer though, I would have to ask you what exactly you disagree with. Do you disagree that good ideas survive and bad ideas don&amp;#39;t? Or do you just disagree that a meme can be quantified because ideas are more vague than genes? Or is it because they can change so easily from person to person?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To the former, I would argue that the invention of the bow and arrow on two different continents is evidence that people will progress towards more effective forms of technology over time. It isn&amp;#39;t that someone just sat down and made it one day. It went through painstaking alterations over time where everyone thought they could make a better version of the invention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or I could point to the creation of Blues music in the US. An entire genre of music was created and became popular because people liked it. There are also the floating verses that are in several blues songs just because they are short, clever, in rhythm, or compelling.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would point to people sharing recipes in families. I would point to the Hero&amp;#39;s Journey, as well as to how holidays all over the world were created around the seasons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s mainly because they are not easily definable, I would argue that genes aren&amp;#39;t easily definable either. We can&amp;#39;t tell what individual gene creates exactly what effect. All we can do is observe how all of the genes combined do by looking at a person, and how their offspring turn out. Only by looking at secondary data can we extrapolate the primary data. Similarly, there are many genes that affect the same factor, such as with height or hair color. Just because we don&amp;#39;t see what individual memes combine to make a certain cultural trend, we don&amp;#39;t know what individual genes contribute to create that a specific person&amp;#39;s ambiguous hair color. (I want to be clear that I&amp;#39;m not suggesting that we can&amp;#39;t tell which genes affect which things ever. I&amp;#39;m saying that we can&amp;#39;t take a person&amp;#39;s genes, independently of the person and know what they look like or what kind of person they are -yet.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If it is because they are so easily changed by how one tells an idea to another person, I would argue my reproductive abilities are the same way, depending on which sperm fertilizes the egg, the person will get a different sampling of my parent&amp;#39;s DNA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And I would argue that while individual instances are easily noticeable, the large scale affects of cultural movements (which would be the equivalent of, say, changes in climate on wetland life) are much more gradual and less affected by these individual changes. An example of this kind of memetic change is how racism has fallen out of favor in the US in the last howeve-rmany years. Not only is it less politically correct to share these ideas, people are often already of the opinion that these ideas are wrong. Over time, the meme of &amp;quot;black is worse than white&amp;quot; is fading away because the culture (or environment -gene equivalent) is hostile towards it. The culture has selected racism against black people to become (next to) extinct. We are seeing a similar change about people&amp;#39;s views on homosexuality. Someday we will probably see people&amp;#39;s opinions of trans-people change (though it will probably change from them being treated as a joke -minstrel shows- to being treated with fear before they start to be accepted).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The only thing left I can think of is that memetic evolution is faster and more spastic than genetic evolution. I would argue that being fast is not part of the definition of evolution. If you burned a forest down, all those species who could not survive without a forest would die out. That would be pretty damn fast. Darwin observed evolution in his lifetime. We observe evolution of diseases every year. It is also very spastic itself, if on it&amp;#39;s own scale. These kinds of individual changes can create dramatic shifts in what is selected for extinction. When London started burning coal, darkening the bark of trees for miles around, white moths -which had originally flourished hiding on the light bark, died out, and dark moths, which originally were rare, became the norm.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you clarify what specifically it is you dislike, I can produce a more honed response, but your arguments against it seem more like a collection of small problems that you add together into one big vague one. Please though, I want to know what you mean.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of points of disagreement I could isolate here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First of all, &amp;quot;copying-fidelity&amp;quot; is a very fuzzy concept. Some degree of mutation is &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for evolution to occur. If anything, memetics tolerates greater failures of copying-fidelity than genetics does.  (Look at the evolution of the Christmas tree from pagan symbol to a Christian symbol; similarly the &amp;#39;Christian fish&amp;#39;, or the handshake from a demonstration of being unarmed to a friendly greeting; &amp;#39;Ring around the rosie&amp;#39; being originally about the Black Death ....).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So memes survive, in altered forms - just like species survive ... by evolving into different species. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You also inject the phrase &amp;quot; for their own good&amp;quot; which Dawkins doesn&amp;#39;t use (IIRC), and that significantly alters the idea you&amp;#39;re opposing.  Genes don&amp;#39;t do anything &amp;quot; for their own good&amp;quot; either; they are machines which replicate under certain conditions, and reality selects for successful replicators.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also - genes can combine, and &lt;a href=""http://discovermagazine.com/2010/jun/03-the-insanity-virus#.UdLzgGKcfxI""&gt;even the concept of distinct organisms can become fuzzy at the genetic level&lt;/a&gt;.   At the meme level -  we could consider that the memes of the Mithras  cult of Rome and the Horus cult of Egypt combined and survived in the same way, in the meme of Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So - consider the elaboration that &lt;em&gt;memes can reproduce sexually&lt;/em&gt;, if that isn&amp;#39;t too much of a stretch.  They can exchange components, and alter form.  The basic point of Dawkins&amp;#39; whole argument is that ideas &amp;quot;survive&amp;quot; by being passed on from person to person over time, and so &lt;em&gt;ideas tend to accrete features that help them to be passed on&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People like thinking that a pleasant eternal afterlife awaits them after the difficulties of this one - so that feature gets added on to the package. Similarly - an omnipotent judge will administer justice to the wicked, you will receive ultimate forgiveness for your wrongdoing, etc. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given this picture, you can see an arc of memetic accretion from Judaism (monotheistic involved god as progress over polytheistic capricious gods), through Christianity as improving the spread of the idea by adding evangelism and salvation, to Islam by upping the evangelism ante, encouraging alignment with civil authorities, and adding penalties for apostasy ...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"I think the word ""queer"" should be considered offensive CMV","Disclaimer: I am personally heterosexual   I know a lot of LGBT people who use the term ""queer"" to describe themselves. At first I thought this was just stripping the word of its power like black people calling each other ""nigga"" but I noticed that LGBT people accept it when non-LGBT people use the term as well, and I was very surprised to learn that it is generally considered PC in most contexts. It seems strange, or well ""queer"" to me that the gay community accepts being called a word that literally means ""strange"" or ""abnormal."" I get that people have the right to be called whatever term they prefer, but I don't understand why gay people are OK with the term, and would like to understand it better. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is wrong with being strange? If you can&amp;#39;t answer that, it should explain why some people are proud to self-identify as queer. Many social movements have a split between people who want to assimilate as &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; and those who want the freedom to be strange without being persecuted for it. An early gay rights rallying cry was &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re here, we&amp;#39;re queer, get used to it.&amp;quot; Society will always have the abnormal, the freaks, geeks, queers, call it what you like. Some view the insistence for normality to be the problem, not the strange.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;its a label, not really a derogatory term and it is used in the correct meaning &amp;quot;abnormal&amp;quot;.  saying something isn&amp;#39;t normal isn&amp;#39;t derogatory.  i usually hear queer in the term &amp;quot;gender queer&amp;quot; which is (as far as i understand it) not identifying with your gender, though not really identifying with the opposite gender either.  so the term used is &amp;quot;gender queer&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;having a different/abnormal gender&amp;quot;  i don&amp;#39;t see why that should be offensive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: Osama bin Laden should've been tried,"As the title says, I think Osama bin Laden should have been subject to a trial. With extraordinary rendition and such that the CIA (among other groups) practices, it shouldn't be too difficult to grab Mr. Laden and transfer him to the USA or some other ""friendly"" territory. If we give the damn Nazis (master-minds of a plot that killed ~12 million) a trial, why not the ""master-mind"" of a plot that killed ~2,000 people?  TL;DR: If we can storm into his house, shoot him (killing him), taking his body, and dumping into the ocean... Why can't we take him, alive, to a ""safe-zone,"" and try him?  As the Declaration of Independence says: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that **all men are created equal.**""","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;it shouldn&amp;#39;t be too difficult to grab Mr. Laden and transfer him to the USA or some other &amp;quot;friendly&amp;quot; territory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;#39;s where your argument falls short. Osama Bin Laden was a very dangerous man, usually surrounded by very dangerous people. I&amp;#39;m sure that a capture attempt happened, but its not worth the risk. Why take the risk of him getting away or possibly killing US troops simply for him to have a trial? Its well known what crimes he has been found guilty for, and he had a &amp;quot;dead or alive&amp;quot; status so to speak. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many also don&amp;#39;t believe he deserved a trial because of the extreme nature of these crimes. I believe that wouldn&amp;#39;t be enough to convince you, so just really think about the fact that it would have been pretty impossible to give him a trial. Too many things could go wrong, the first shot that can be taken had to have been taken in order to ensure more lives would not be lost due to him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nazi&amp;#39;s were heads of governments, leading uniformed, professional militaries, who surrendered unconditionally at the end of the war.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bin Laden was leading a terrorist organization, no official uniformed military, who was hiding out in a compound in Pakistan. He did DESERVE a trial for his crimes, but he was in a heavily armed compound, and I&amp;#39;m fairly certain either him or the woman who was in the room with him had an AK-47 so the idea that he was standing there with his hands up waiting for the U.S. to take him to trial is completely false.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) The people in the compound were armed, so the SEAL team needed to go in ready to protect themselves. TAZERs and non-lethal methods probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have gotten the job done.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) The Nazi leaders were wearing uniforms, and they were Nazi&amp;#39;s so they were probably wearing elaborate, recognizable uniforms. Bin Laden was wearing daily clothing, it probably wasn&amp;#39;t possible to see his face, and the SEAL members probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have really recognized him anyway as I don&amp;#39;t think we had seen pictures of him in years whereas Nazi higher ups were extremely public figures.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very possible that the guy saw someone standing there, shot him, and later figured out it was Bin Laden. If he wanted a trial, he should have turned himself in. He didn&amp;#39;t, so he got shot twice in the face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: I believe that the Gay Marriage discussion isn't as important as the media portrays it to be,"The real problem is the concept of marriage itself. In my view, LGBT couples are already married, regardless of the legislation that is imposed on them. Marriage isn't a set of civil rights that confirms your connection to your partner, it's the choice you make to be in private, daily, lifelong commitment to another being.  Tradition dictates that in order to be 'properly' married you have to exchange vows, get a ring, and have a massive celebration (the set of traditions change based upon the culture.) But marriage isn't that, it is simple commitment to another person. The main issue that gay marriage has is that not all couples are given the same civil liberties, but this does not mean that their marriages are void. Marriage isn't decided by bystanders, it's decided by the people who live inside the union. It is for this very reason that a gay couple getting married doesn't affect your own marriage.   I've held this opinion for a while but have never had the opportunity to see if it stood up to criticism. CMV.  EDIT: Just to emphasise I believe that the gay couples should receive the same civil rights as straight couples however what I am stating above is that these civil liberties aren't required to be married to someone. These civil liberties come second to the relationship that you share with someone and no documentation ever defines that.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

You are right that unrequited love is, in it&amp;#39;s own right, the principle reward of a long-term committed and monogamous relationship. But is there  to be said for the emotional toll it takes on preventing those couple from having officially recognized marriages? Why do you think you see those tearful courthouse weddings when gay marriage is legalized? Those people didn&amp;#39;t suddenly start loving each other more because they were married, they were crying happy because they felt included and equal to everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s to say nothing to the societal impact of having legal gay marriage. In places where it is not allowed, it keeps alive a social stigma against LGBT persons, legitimizes it a way that goes beyond a simple social contract. Marriage is a symbol, and denying it to certain group is a symbol as well. When bi-racial marriages were illegal, was that really about the fact that the people didn&amp;#39;t have the same legal rights, or was it about the continued prejudicial treatment of minority group with the explicit purpose of discriminating against that minority.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why the issue is one that needs to be framed around marriage. It&amp;#39;s a symbol, and those sort of things are extremely important for affecting real change. If you legally legitimize gay marriage, you legitimize the rights of LGBT people as equal not just in marriage, but as citizens who are equally valued as their heterosexual counterparts.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole problem with this argument and the arguments you made responding to people is you are playing semantics.

Oh, &amp;quot;Civil Unions&amp;quot; are OK, but not &amp;quot;Marriages,&amp;quot; or maybe &amp;quot;Domestic Partnerships&amp;quot; or whatever. The fact of the matter is; the ENTIRE reason is people want equal rights. By denying civil liberties that a MARRIED couple has (by law), they are denying the marriage. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are civil liberties that are required with marriage. Adoption is one in some states, visiting your husband or wife in the ICU is another one. Guess what gay married couples can&amp;#39;t do? In accordance with state law, since the state does not recognize an LGBT couple as married, there are civil liberties that aren&amp;#39;t accessible to them. The root of the problem is the unavailability for these couples to get married in order to receive these liberties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: ""If you aren't with us, you're against us"" is an unhealthy and incorrect mentality; passive non-participation is not the same as opposition.","This idea has probably been around as long as people have existed but I think it is flawed. I do not think that simply by existing I have somehow chosen sides on any number of topics or issues of which I am or am not aware. In my experience, this type of thinking is used to persuade someone to actively join a cause through guilt (""You are part of the system, so if you aren't working to right the inherent wrongs, you are part of the problem"") but I think it often has the unintended effect of reinforcing ingroup vs. outgroup psychology by alienating people and telling them they have done something wrong. Common examples include race and gender issues.   This tends to have some shades of moral or philosophical implications with regards to things that you ""should"" do. In my opinion, I have no obligation to actively effect change for any cause, even if it is tangentially related to me (e.g. I don't have to protest a war that may be unjust simply because my country is involved, I don't have to fight against discrimination that doesn't apply to me, etc.). I use extreme examples to underscore the point that those things do not directly affect me. I did not cause them, support them, or actively contribute to them. I am obligated not to *actively engage* in things that are wrong, but that is a separate topic.   Change my view that it is possible to sit on the sidelines for things that don't affect me without being a detractor.  EDIT: As it has been pointed out, there are plenty of examples of when a choice is truly binary, and non-participation is not an option. This is not what I was referring to. I specifically had in mind instances when it is applied in systematic social problems that don't fall neatly into a binary choice (not limited to those I listed, but I tried to choose examples which would illustrate clearly instances of when this logic might be applied). Also, as noted ""non-action"" is not the same as ""non-participation"", and in some circumstances non-action is clearly a choice supporting one side of the issue.  My description was not meant to limit the scope of the topic, but to give context to times when I have experienced this type of thinking. The context may or may not be helpful depending on your experiences.    &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

CMV: Children should not be raised religiously,"Let me begin by saying that I'm not religious myself but I have nothing against people being religious. What I'm against however, is children being brought up in religious backgrounds. This includes religious schools, weekly attending churches (or whatever is applicable) - basically any activity that promotes a one certain religion.   I have nothing against children learning about different religions/ beliefs. Just don't think they should be 'taught/raised' in a particular one. I believe children don't have the capacity to think for themselves at that age yet. They should be free to choose what they want to believe in once they reached a certain maturity level. I'm hesitant to give an age as to when that might be as each child is different. Rather, children should learn about different religions and different beliefs in the world before making a decision.  Edit: Had my view (partially) changed. Realized that I did in fact have a problem with religious teachings so cannot look in the point of view of religious parents + cannot comment on their parenting styles. I believed that raising a child religiously is harmful because they will not be able to think for themselves. But as many of you commented, being religiously raised has actually been a positive impact on your life.

I absolutely agree that these things are highly, highly important. It&amp;#39;s those skills that i have that have forwarded my career as far and as fast as it has. But these are not the only things a child should learn. They should also learn how to love, and that they are loved. They should be provided multiple communities where they have the chance to develop their social skills. They should learn about the power of respect and the recognizance of human dignity as opposed to the trap of senselessly judging others as many of us do. Do i need a church to teach all these things? No. But I&amp;#39;m only human, will definitely not be the perfect dad, and will need some help in these areas.

"CMV: I have no desire to drink alcohol or partake in its associated culture, even at legal age.","I’ve simply never seen the point in drinking. I’ve been to a few stereotypical high school parties where people have asked me why I don’t drink on several occasions. I really have no specific reasons as to why I choose to abstain: I’m not religious, can’t dismiss it due to taste (although I’ve heard it’s fairly awful), have no history of alcoholics in my family, etc. I usually just go with excuses such as “I just don’t drink”, despite wanting to respond with something along the lines of “I don’t want to become like you” after seeing what drinking does to friends and classmates. As a result of not drinking I’ve stopped going to parties, as have the number of invites stopped coming. Six months into university the drinking culture is even worse than before. Essentially every school event is closely tied to drinking. As I don’t drink and people seem to be somewhat weirded out by that, I’ve yet to attend one of these uni events.   Not that I think adults or more *sophisticated* drinkers are any better. They come across to me as elitist and pretentious. “Oh, you’re drinking *that*?”, “this wine has hints of pear and an underlying smoky taste”, to which I can only roll my eyes.  I also dislike the notion of inebriety being seen as something desirable and cool. Losing the ability of rational thinking, depending on it as a social lubricant, having lesser-than-average consensual sex, breaking things, hurting people physically or emotionally all seem like idiotic things, even less so boasting about it. Not to mention the adverse health and economic implications that entail this activity.  At the same time I feel like an outcast among my peers. I cannot relate to their weekend antics at a fundamental level and I fear that I might miss out on things I’ll never be able to experience later on. I’m torn on the issue – on the one hand I want to be more *normal*, on the other hand I take pride in having stood up to peer-pressure for so many years and practiced a fair amount of  self-discipline. Please CMV.  **Edit** Wow, thanks for all the responses! Lots to read and think about – I'll try to reply to as many comments as I can tonight.  **Edit 2** Based on most of the comments I should simply have a couple of drinks before forming a definite opinion on the subject. While that seems quick and easy, the idea of me drinking is almost unimaginable to me. Can't even picture it. I don't know how to deal with this, maybe it'll come with age (or desperation?). All this has really made me think about myself in a different way and that will need some time to process.  **Edit 3** You've C'd my V, at least to some extent. I figure as I'm only a teen for a few more weeks I might as well mark the occasion. Won't pop my alcohol cherry at uni with people I only know very platonically though. Will instead invite very close childhood friends for a night of cooking, board games and drinking (baby steps). You guys have been stressing drinking in moderation, so if anyone would provide more detailed insight into that I'd be grateful (I'm 6"", 135 lbs if that's of any assistance). Also tips on what to drink/mix for a total newbie would be great. Deltas will be awarded in due time, gotta catch some Zs first.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV: Power is good. Greed is good.,"I believe power is good because it allows one who has proper self-control and a proper feel of responsibility to do godly things. Like fund research for immortality, or create a gigantic statue just to have it destroyed, to show how much power they have.  I believe *controlled* greed is good because it leads to a craving for more everything. Controlled, I believe it leads to a constant reminder of what one should do with their life as opposed to what they are doing right now.  Why do I believe this? Because I want to be perfect, I want to be godly. I want to get to the point where people work for me, where I would just have to say the word ""make this"" and this would be done without any effort done in my part.  Change my view, please. Tell me how and why this is wrong.   EDIT: Thank you for your inputs. I'm sorry I didn't get to reply early enough now :( But thank you again, I will go over each comment and consider. :)","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One obvious objection is that historically, I don&amp;#39;t see any evidence that this sort of lifestyle leads to anything resembling happiness.  What&amp;#39;s the point from which you are getting the idea that a human life of power is one that is desirable to have?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the greatest warlords in history lead terrible lives while in a complete state of power.  Mostly because a system that is rule via terror is usually one that is rule via whoever can kill the current leader.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;edit--&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Additionally, I think the life where you &amp;#39;have power&amp;#39; is going to be a lot more dependent on others then you think.  You will have to keep your guards happy, you will have to keep potential enemies happy, you will have to manage your operation, you will have to keep your slaves in check etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few quick questions:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Starting with your first paragraph, wouldn&amp;#39;t power be morally neutral that is to say, shouldn&amp;#39;t your topic be &amp;quot;power can be good&amp;quot; which is a lot less controversial?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As written, &amp;quot;power is good&amp;quot; implies that the ownership of power is morally good or that the use of power is morally good.  You later add the stipulations which lead me to believe that you only think that power can be good in certain situations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now greed... I think there is some equivocation going on here.  You add yet another stipulation (which arguably fundamentally changes the meaning of the word &amp;#39;greed&amp;#39;).  It sounds more like &lt;em&gt;desire&lt;/em&gt; is what you mean which isn&amp;#39;t exclusive to the greedy.  It sounds more like ambition to me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So my question, do you mean to say &amp;quot;Power &lt;em&gt;can be&lt;/em&gt; good. &lt;em&gt;Ambition/Desire&lt;/em&gt; is good.&amp;quot; which is a lot less provocative? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
I think the U.S. should seriously consider breaking apart. - CMV,"I think the politics in America has become a force that inhibits competent governance for all citizens.   I simply believe that there are too many people of different political opinions to address the concerns of our citizens properly. Since many of these differences of opinions are predicted by geographical region, I think it would be wise to break up the United States.   Let me elaborate further. For example, let the New England area become its own country, or even join with Canada for that matter should they desire to. The makeup of this area of the country is being hurt by the rest of the country. The policies they wish to see implemented are being blocked by other groups of people hundreds or even thousands of miles away.   Likewise for the South. If the majority of people in the South want less government, and to let religion be a powerful force in their politics, why not let them? Why should people far away deny them of this?  I also think we would do the world a favor by breaking apart militarily. Perhaps we can remain a continental coalition militarily, but a large part of the country would never commit their troops to another engagement like Vietnam or Iraq, thus limiting the scale of which ""America"" could be involved in a conflict. This arrangement could also allow unity among N. America should a conflict arise that all of us need to participate in.   This is just a general overview of my view and I hope to get into some great discussion about this. I have put a lot of thought into it, and as a disabled veteran I say it with a heavy heart. It is like that feeling  you get agreeing with the vet that your dog needs to be put to sleep (an analogy, not a comparison).  EDIT: Sorry for my lack of my involvement guys, I had an ER visit that took up a lot of my time.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;what would you do with the large minorities in the regions who end up in  countries they don&amp;#39;t want to be in? forced transfer? genocide? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;why not just allow more freedom to local and state governments instead of breaking up the most powerful nation in the world into 4 or 5 shitty countries? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;to change your view i offer you a better option, allow more local control and less federal control and let each do as they wish to a certain extent while maintaining a constitution that enforces the rights of minorities, personal beliefs and property, and government oversight (kind of like the constitution we have now) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;it is a myth that you would be doing the world a favor by taking apart the most powerful country in the world.  Considering we tend not to overtly abuse our powers and for the most part respect the rule of law compared to our next nearest competitors. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Do you think china or Russia unconcerned about the USA would be such neighborly people to have around? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Coalitions don&amp;#39;t work nearly as well as unified countries. best to keep us the way we are and next time vote for more state power and less federal power in your local and federal elections&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It shouldn&amp;#39;t be necessary if we go back to the way this country was designed. Each state is supposed to be a sovereign nation, with the people picking the kind of government they want. These states got together to create a federal government to unite them and provide for mutual defense, a common currency and a few other things. If you don&amp;#39;t like one state, move to one that better suits you. The idea was multiple small experiments in democracy, not one big one.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem of not being able to govern people with such widely differing political opinions is that the federal government has become too powerful and has started imposing policy on the people directly and uniformly across the nation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"I think cultural issues such as gay rights, gender equality, and body image get far too much discussion on the internet relative to more important economic issues. CMV.","I think in the popular sphere of internet discussion gender, body image and LGBT issues (cultural issues) are over-discussed relative to far more important issues of economic equality and to a certain extent, environmental issues, which will have much more lasting impacts on our society. This is important because economic conditions largely underpin the over-discussed issues.  First and foremost, I am not saying these issues are not real nor problematic. They certainly exist and affect people everyday and honestly, I am happy to see them being discussed at all. However, in recent years I've noticed the amount of discussion around things like women's body image, transgender rights and men's rights increase exponentially while issues like poverty, inequality, and climate change only emerge on my facebook feed occasionally. While my FB is a terrible sample, I think a similar conclusion can be drawn from looking at debates on Tumblr, Reddit etc.  This concerns me because things like rapid car growth and urbanization in China are going to have far more consequences on our lives than issues like whether or not 'thin privilege' is a thing. America is in a second gilded age where inequality increasing with huge consequences our country, but people spend hours debating the racial implications of Miley Cyrus twerking. The list goes on.  I think this is important because economic (and beyond that, environmental) issues effect everybody and determine the overall well-being of society as a whole. While certain issues effect certain populations, they become less and less relevant if we are all, collectively, completely fucked. For example, it won't be worth debating racist and sexist hiring preferences if there are no jobs left to hire for.  I think this is because it is a lot harder to have a solid, strong opinion on these things because it requires a lot of research and critical thinking compared to cultural criticism, which you can go at with a few Tumblr posts and personal anecdotes in your pocket. People want to feel like they are making a change in society, so they go out and debate issues that are most tangible to them while ignoring less visible but more insidious issues that are more important in the long run.  tl;dr: cultural issues, while real and important, are over-discussed on the internet relative to more important economic issues that affect everybody and underpin many cultural issues. CMV, reddit?  **EDIT: My view has been changed, or at least my approach. I realize now that I am approaching this issue far too much from my own internet filter bubble and I can't really know ""what is being discussed on the internet"" because I have a limited, controlled view. I am only seeing what my friends post and extrapolating from there that the rest of the internet is the same as my little bubble. Further comments have made me realize that the trade-off between cultural and economic issues are not necessarily zero-sum and that cultural and economic issues are almost always intertwined.**  **EDIT2: Wow, this sorta blew up.

There are a lot of people who are not capable of discussing economic and environmental issues.  There&amp;#39;s also a lot of people who aren&amp;#39;t interested, because it&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot;.

"CMV: Watches today serve no functional purpose other than fashion, and therefore are a waste of money","Many years ago, watches served the purpose of being able to tell time.  Now, with cell phones, as well as a plethora of other personal devices that are able to tell time, watches are functionally useless.  In my opinion, the only reason watches still exist are for fashion appeal, which I find stupid.  Yeah boots cost $100+, but they serve a niche purpose that hasn't been filled by another item.  I just think it's asinine to spend $100+ dollars on an item with no functional purpose for the sake of being fashionable.  Maybe being a broke college student affects this belief but I just do not understand the reason why watches still exist in today's time, no pun intended. CMV. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"CMV: The term ""survivor"" to refer to victims of sexual assault is inappropriate.","These people are definitely ""victims,"" but in my opinion, referring to them as ""survivors"" is in many cases overly dramatic. They might be referred to as ""survivors"" if their lives legitimately came into jeopardy (if they were held at gunpoint, if they were severely physically assaulted, etc.), but most instances of rape (unwanted sexual advances isolated to a single instance) do not come attached with a serious possibility of death. Rape is definitely one of the worst things that can happen to somebody, but I think that ""survivor"" suggests that what happened to them was on the same level as living through a genocidal campaign, a terminal illness, a plane crash, or something else of the sort. The former is bad, but the latter are almost certainly worse. Rape victims calling themselves ""survivors"" takes attention away from more serious issues in which death is on the line. Again, rape is a very serious issue, but not as serious as issues that consistently result in death. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I don't see the joy in raising a mental handicapped child CMV,"Whenever I see parents that are taking care of their children who have been diagnosed with extreme cases of mental disability, I often ask myself ""Why?""   In social situations it really only seems to be an astronomical cause of stress. Bathing the child, always making sure he/she isn't hurting him/herself. It literally never ends. To me, the joy of raising a child is watching it grow from an 8 pound crying/pooping machine into a functioning adult who has no limits to his/her capabilities. This dream is severely dampened with a mentally handicapped child.  The other issue I find, is that a lot of these children are also incapable of really expressing their emotions, and often cannot even verbalize what they want besides grunts and tantrums. Obviously this perspective is probably wildly different when the child has half of your genes, but to me it definitely seems harder to love this child. Especially when the child is a huge stressor. You can also say goodbye to a relaxing retirement.

From this, there are two possible explanations: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) Something has always existed. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) Something came from nothing. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If something has always existed, then it is possible (but not certain) that everything is caused by what has occurred previously in an unbroken line stretching back forever. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If something came from nothing, then we know that it is possible for something to occur without a prior cause. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Without more information, both options are equally likely. Within the &amp;quot;something has always existed&amp;quot; option, things may still not be entirely determined by previous causes. So, without further information, it seems like the odds are in favour that not everything is predetermined. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Free will&amp;quot; if it exists seems intimately linked in with consciousness. We have determinism from our understanding of the physical universe. We have some ideas of what things that are conscious look like at physical level (re brain structures), but we don&amp;#39;t have a way (to the best of my knowledge) for being able to explain the existence of subjective conscious experiences. That is, we can learn of physical things, and even see that those physical things influence mental states, but we don&amp;#39;t have an understanding of how physical things can produce the subjective conscious experience that we have - knowing neurons can form new connections doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily tell us about the &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; of it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since free will (if it exists) is tied in to something that we don&amp;#39;t understand how it is linked to the physical world, and our understanding of causality comes from the physical world, it is premature to decide that free will doesn&amp;#39;t exist. The physical can affect our subjective conscious experiences, but that by itself doesn&amp;#39;t mean that our subjective conscious experiences can&amp;#39;t also affect the physical, or that they must necessarily follow the same rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we can&amp;#39;t know that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reality isn&amp;#39;t simply just a program, running to completion. Or at least, form our current understanding of physics, nor do all chemical reactions have one given outcome, at least at the atomic level.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Actually, since this is a question of physics more than chemistry or philosophy, according to our current understanding of the laws of quantum mechanics, there is not a definite result at any given time. Particle attributes such as speed, spin, and location can be expressed by probability waves, and there is no one definite result. Einstein disagreed, bringing up hidden variables, but he was proved wrong by numerous experiments. So unless proven otherwise, current knowledge holds that you are wrong: Time is not a progression from A to B but a randomized dance that could end up infinite different ways.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But all that means is that chemicals mixing can be different on a molecular level, which can have an impact on the brain. I would say this would be hesitant evidence for the existence of free will - life is not a simple progression from A to B. There are no foregone conclusions; our lives are up in the air. This does not, of course, confirm that we are the ones making the decisions, but it is a step closer to that conclusion. There is even some debate as to whether there is a comprehensive, universal theory. According to a great Hawking book I read about physics, there are currently three things that could be true about our ability to understand the universe:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The laws of our universe are impossible to understand; they cannot be fathomed and we&amp;#39;ll never get there. This has already been proven fairly false - we&amp;#39;ve made great strides towards understanding.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The laws of physics are convoluted enough that we&amp;#39;ll never get to perfection. It will be like listing pi - you&amp;#39;ll be more an more precise as you go along, and after a point you may as well be exact, but you will never get exactly there.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The laws of physics are expressible through mathematics to perfect certainty. This, clearly, is what everyone is hoping for, and what you assumed is true about the universe. Unfortunately, if the universe does really work under rules of probability even if this is true, we&amp;#39;ll never be able to predict the future with perfect certainty.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So in conclusion, I would say that since the universe doesn&amp;#39;t work on a strict A to B progression, and everything is built and seems exactly as though humans have free will, there are only two logical conclusions to come to: Either we have free will, or we have a perfectly functioning impression of free will that completes the same result. The quote &amp;quot;What if gravity doesn&amp;#39;t exist, but a force exactly like gravity does&amp;quot; comes to mind. I personally am a proponent of the first, partially out of optimism and partially because there is enough evidence that a perfectly functioning system that imitates free will but isn&amp;#39;t just doesn&amp;#39;t seem as likely to me, from my own version of an applied Occam&amp;#39;s Razor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: I'm starting to believe 9/11 may have been at least partially propagated by the U.S. Government.,"EDIT: Please refrain from making anymore comments about controlled demolitions, my view has been thoroughly changed on that matter. I accept it as basically an impossibility.   I'm going to start off by saying that I'm not by any means a full-blown conspiratard, but the potential of 9/11 being propagated by the US Gov't is an idea that has always interested me. I've read most of the other 9/11 threads on this sub and they've all fostered fantastic discussions. I was hoping to have a discussion on some points I saw made in another thread. The rest of this post is going to be a comment I saw made in another thread which calls to light some inconsistencies in the official story behind the 9/11 attacks. Despite the research I've done on the subject, I'm not yet educated enough to be able to dispute many of these. I'm hoping that some of you can assist me with that, because the more I think about it the more I think that this whole thing being a false flag is a possibility.  Before I get into the full comment that I mentioned, the first and foremost thing I would like to have someone debunk is the [Insider Trading](http://en.wikipedia.org/?title=9/11_conspiracy_theories#Suspected_insider_trading) conspiracy theory, as that is one of the most compelling ones for me. What could be a reason for the MASSIVE disparity between ""put"" and ""call' options, and why did it only involve the two airlines whose planes were hijacked?  With that asked, here is the full comment from the other thread.  I have questions about that day and many others do as well — *Did you know?* — Senator Max Cleland Resigned from the 9/11 Commission.

It&amp;#39;s a long read so I&amp;#39;m going to pull out some of the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AMR put trading on September 10 further reveals how trading that looks highly suspicious at first blush can prove innocuous. The put volume of AMR on September 10 was unusually high and actually exceeded the call volume by a ratio of 6:1—again, highly suspicious on its face. The SEC traced much of the surge in volume to a California investment advice newsletter, distributed by email and fax on Sunday, September 9, which advised its subscribers to purchase a particular type of AMR put options. The SEC interviewed 28 individuals who purchased these types of AMR puts on September 10, and found that 26 of them cited the newsletter as the reason for their transaction. Another 27 purchasers were listed as subscribers of the newsletter. The SEC interviewed the author of the newsletter, a U.S. citizen, who explained his investment strategy analysis, which had nothing to do with foreknowledge of 9/11. Other put option volume on September 10 was traced to similarly innocuous trades.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another good example concerns a suspicious UAL put trade on September 7, 2001. A single trader bought more than one-third of the total puts purchased that day, establishing a position that proved very profitable after 9/11. Moreover, it turns out that the same trader had a short position in UAL calls—another strategy that would pay off if the price of UAL dropped. Investigation, however, identified the purchaser as a well-established New York hedge fund with $2 billion under management. Setting aside the unlikelihood of al Qaeda having a relationship with a major New York hedge fund, these trades looked facially suspicious. But further examination showed the fund also owned 29,000 shares of UAL stock at the time—all part of a complex, computer-driven trading strategy. As a result of these transactions, the fund actually lost $85,000 in value when the market reopened. Had the hedge fund wanted to profit from the attacks, it would not have retained the UAL shares.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The FBI investigated a trader who bought a substantial position in put options in AIG Insurance Co. shortly before 9/11. Viewed in isolation, the trade looked highly suspicious, especially when AIG stock plummeted after 9/11. The FBI found that the trade had been made by a fund manager to hedge a long position of 4.2 million shares in the AIG common stock. The fund manager owned a significant amount of AIG stock, but the fund had a very low tax basis in the stock (that is, it had been bought long ago and had appreciated significantly over time). Selling even some of it would have created a massive tax liability. Thus, the fund manager chose to hedge his position through a put option purchase. After 9/11, the fund profited substantially from its investment in puts. At the same time, however, it suffered a substantial loss on the common stock, and overall lost money as a result of the attacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When you just look at the fact that there were way more put options, it sounds very suspicious.  So that&amp;#39;s all &amp;quot;truthers&amp;quot; mention.  When you go a little deeper, and look at each of the individual companies and individuals who made those trades, as the SEC did, you see that there&amp;#39;s a reasonable, completely non-conspiracy reason those trades happened.  A conspiracy theorist will tell you &amp;quot;well the SEC was in on it&amp;quot;.  And in isolation, maybe that could be true.  But they have to say that over and over, about a growing number of people, organizations, and groups.  When your list of conspirators grows to thousands and thousands of individuals, it doesn&amp;#39;t make sense.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When you consider the scale of 9/11 - 1000&amp;#39;s killed, buildings destroyed, a significant change to our countries&amp;#39; mindset and even culture, you will find coincidences.  But when you fully investigate those coincidences, you don&amp;#39;t find a conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use Occam&amp;#39;s Razor here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How much money would they have made with all of these put options? A hundred million? There are easier ways to make money with WAY less risk than this.  Stock market activity is tracked like crazy, and the people who would have perpetrated it would know that as well.  If they had the ability to pull something like 9/11 off to make money, they would also have the ability to make money without something that would expose them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A lot of your sources basically claim that it was all a controlled demolition.  Think about what that would mean.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Who did the work?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How were they able to wire 2 buildings with 110 floors each without anyone noticing? No fresh drywall or paint noticed. No security tapes. Nothing.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What was the plan if something went wrong, as happens from time to time in demolitions? What if the plane just clipped the building?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How many people would have been involved at each level?  How much money would it take to keep EVERY SINGLE ONE of them quiet? Basically anyone involved would have enough proof to blow it wide open for, what would basically be the single biggest news story of all human history. Why hasn&amp;#39;t that happened?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"CMV:Immigrants who are illegal and/or do not pay taxes, should not get any public service that come from tax money","This includes any sort of welfare assistance, health care, etc. I honestly don't care if they come to America or not.

It cheapens the lot for legal immigrants and citizens alike if you get the same benefits regardless if you are legally present or not.

If they own property they pay property taxes. If illegal immigrants pay these types of taxes, why should they not be eligible to receive at least some public services?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, it&amp;#39;s impossible to stop illegal immigrants from using all public services.

How does the military protect its citizens but not illegal immigrants?

Imagine that an illegal immigrant comes in, and he comes down with a deadly disease.

Now, given that, he&amp;#39;s probably serving thousands of people daily.  he&amp;#39;s the guy ringing up sales, he&amp;#39;s the guy making your hamburger.  He&amp;#39;s sick like a dog with a deadly and easily transmittable disease.

So the first time someone is going to look at him and realize he&amp;#39;s sick is pretty much when he&amp;#39;s dead.  Someone does an autopsy and finds out that he&amp;#39;s got a deadly disease that spreads easily.

So how do you warn the perhaps hundreds of people who he served over the course of the incubation period of the disease?    You have a mess, and no way to contact those affected -- just wait until people get sick.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Only criminals should be worried about government snooping,"I don't believe that regular citizens have anything to worry about. It would be logistically impossible for any government officials to scrawl through your history and know everything about each citizen; they just have this information at hand in case they need catch a criminal.

CMV: Five-star-ism is converting all ratings to binaries and is making the world worse.,"I made this comment on /r/flipping but I want to discuss it further, because it's something that I genuinely think is a social problem, however I'd like to be reassured otherwise.  eBay are cancelling the accounts of sellers who get more than around 8% of less than five star ratings. By doing this, eBay are trying to force sellers to satisfy 100% of buyers. Because there is some irreducible percentage of buyers who are unreasonable, this is never going to actually work. Getting an unreasonable buyer is random, and accordingly there will be sellers who get pushed out due to nothing more than the bad luck of getting several unreasonable buyers in a row. No matter how good you are, your eBay account now has a half-life.  This is a consequence of an American cultural malaise, ""five-star-ism"", the drive towards unreasonable standards of perfection, and the perfect is the enemy of the good. A pass is a good mark. Three star service is actually good service. Three stars means that it wasn't noticably great or noticably terrible; you just got exactly what you wanted. Every transaction that you did today, that you didn't even notice, what you got there was three star service. You deserve three star service. What makes better service better, is that you didn't actually deserve it.  In a sane world, if you get better than acceptable service, that's four stars. If you get the best service you've ever seen, that's five. If you were disappointed in some way which is clearly attributable to the service provider, but you still got more-or-less what you wanted, that's two stars. If they were completely incompetent and absolutely failed you, that's one star. (Or zero, if they intentionally angered you.)  However, those who decide these things in eBay, Uber, Walmart, Blizzard, various American call centres, etc etc have all somehow come to the bizarre decision that ""acceptable"" should mean five stars, and anything less than five stars, is unacceptable. I took an Uber ride the other day. I rated the guy five stars, for no other reason than that I knew that if I did not, he would be punished. He had done nothing wrong. He did exactly what I expected of him. No more, no less. He deserved three stars. I wanted to be able to give him that rating without any concern for his continued employment (well, his contract).  This state of affairs completely grinds my gears. It destroys the very purpose of having rating systems at all. It converts the rating system back to a binary, ""bad/good"", with no meaningful distinction between those ratings. Worse, it makes no actual provision for recognition of genuinely good service. If you rate any seller who sent the thing out in acceptable condition within acceptable time as ""five star"" - how do you fairly rate the one who sent it out quicker than you expected, better packed, and the item in better condition than you were told? How do you rate the Uber driver who showed up early, got you to your destination quickly, and had a great conversation with you?  Am I wrong? Have I missed something here?  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I don&amp;#39;t feel like you think that excellence is a bad thing, just that companies should be satisfied with &amp;quot;acceptable.&amp;quot; I hope that I can convince you as to why companies encourage their employees to perform their job excellently -- giving 110 percent, as the saying goes -- and ask, or hope, for their clients to rate them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first point to keep in mind is that most simple review and rating systems descend into this no matter how well-intentioned their goals are. For example, some video game magazines and websites use 10 point reviewing schemes -- but very often they will not rate a game that is &amp;quot;acceptable&amp;quot; as any lower than a 7, even though the numbers suggest that a 5-6 would be &amp;quot;acceptable.&amp;quot; This is largely because, to many customers, &amp;quot;good enough isn&amp;#39;t good enough&amp;quot;, which is probably a result of a culture that promotes and strives for excellence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The alternative is to give up on forcing people to use numbers, but without numbers, it can be very difficult to translate one person&amp;#39;s experience to another&amp;#39;s. Numbers provide a less ambiguous metric that allows other people to predict if their experiences will be acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If we replaced the current system with ratings of:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Terrible&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Below Expectations&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Acceptable&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Above Expectations&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Excellent&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Companies would still push for &amp;quot;Excellent.&amp;quot; If we went back in time and made every already-existing system follow these rules, this post would still exist, except it would be protesting &amp;quot;Excellent-ism&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;Five-star-ism.&amp;quot; The only thing that might changes is where the line falls for customers versus where it falls for sellers -- every business wants to be seen as &amp;quot;Excellent&amp;quot; at what they do, while customers might only care about getting &amp;quot;Acceptable&amp;quot; performance, especially if excellence comes at a cost.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, I do agree with you that punishing sub-5 ratings by anybody except the consumers themselves is probably further than we need to go. A 2-star seller on eBay should suffer a market stigma entirely by market forces, without eBay needing to intervene and delete the account. A 4-star seller will probably do less business than a consistent 5-star seller, but may also tend to have lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I absolutely understand your problem with the system, but what you&amp;#39;re arguing for would be for businesses to say &amp;quot;We strive for whatever, so rate us accurately.&amp;quot; Would you be satisfied if you walked into a bank that was just clean enough, with tellers who sort of apathetically handed you your cash? Would you be satisfied if you went into a restaurant that had clean-ish tables and took just under the edge of your patience to get things done?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is why businesses strive for 4 or 5 or Excellent -- they don&amp;#39;t want you to just be satisfied with your experience. They want you to be happy with their experience. They don&amp;#39;t just want to satisfy you enough that you&amp;#39;ll come back, but to make you pleased enough that you will recommend them to your friends. To achieve this goal, they need to strive for Excellence, but just Acceptableness. 3-star reviews don&amp;#39;t bring customers in, and they barely maintain their patronage. Five star reviews do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Getting an unreasonable buyer is random, and accordingly there will be sellers who get pushed out due to nothing more than the bad luck of getting several unreasonable buyers in a row. No matter how good you are, your eBay account now has a half-life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re argument&amp;#39;s biggest problem is a lack of  a causal link. Your thesis is that five-star rating systems drive things towards a binary, good/bad, system. But, IMO, everything you&amp;#39;ve argued applies equally to a four star system.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;those who decide these things in eBay, Uber, Walmart, Blizzard, various American call centres, etc etc have all somehow come to the bizarre decision that &amp;quot;acceptable&amp;quot; should mean five stars, and anything less than five stars, is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I rate things on a four star system, I have the same thinking. I only give less than four stars for something that is, procedurally or substantively, defective in some way. In fact, I&amp;#39;d argue that with more stars, I&amp;#39;m less reluctant to give less than perfect. With a five-star system, four stars still looks like really good service to me. But, three stars seems less so, and makes me want to give three and a half.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a sane world, if you get better than acceptable service, that&amp;#39;s four stars. If you get the best service you&amp;#39;ve ever seen, that&amp;#39;s five. If you were disappointed in some way which is clearly attributable to the service provider, but you still got more-or-less what you wanted, that&amp;#39;s two stars. If they were completely incompetent and absolutely failed you, that&amp;#39;s one star. (Or zero, if they intentionally angered you.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;d be possible to get people to adhere to one system of rating things. Some people will never rate less than a perfect score, and others will be really picky. But, I don&amp;#39;t really see anything that implies a 5-star system encourages a bad/good system more than a 4-star system does. In fact, as I&amp;#39;ve argued, I&amp;#39;d think that the bigger the range of numbers, the less apprehensive a person will be about giving their true opinion (this is used in many scientific studies more recently, too. A 1-10 system can give very different results from a 1-100 test)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;eBay are cancelling the accounts of sellers who get more than around 8% of less than five star ratings. By doing this, eBay are trying to force sellers to satisfy 100% of buyers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would argue that the true creation of the binary system comes from the fact that people don&amp;#39;t care enough to spend time thinking about what rating a seller/buyer actually deserves. Because of this, the norm becomes 5 stars. Furthermore, companies like Ebay see this, and thus set the bar at 5 stars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: There is no such thing as a mental illness caused by genetics and 'chemical imbalance' attributed to genetics does not exist.,"Even if you have a genetic pre-disposition to schizophrenia, statistically youu probably wont get it and even if you dont have that pre-disposition you can still become schizophrenic. Genetics play a role in your statistical likelihood but considering a genetic pre-disposition does no actual pre-determine anything, it's still determined by your environment.   Likewise a chemical imbalance of dopamine or serotonin can exist but it doesnt follow that you're born with it. Our brains are changing constantly. Whatever you're doing at any time, you're training your brain to be better at it. Through neuroplasticity a certain environment can create a brain which behaves in a certain way, and just like you get better when you practice piano, the more you feel a certain emotion, the more that process is physically occuring in your brain, the more that process is strengthened similar to the physical neurological process of improving your piano skills. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I think that research into wind and solar energy sources are a waste of time. Nuclear power is the only way to go. CMV.,"My mother has worked in the nuclear industry my entire life. My step-father has worked in the nuclear industry for nearly four decades. Knowing the capabilities of nuclear power and the fact that it provides the greatest *amount* of power per unit tells me that it's more valuable than any other energy source. The media is a scare-tactic douche machine that needs to promote the fantastic possibilities instead of making people uncomfortable.  Germany used to have a fantastic nuclear program and they reached their goal of lowering carbon emissions before their estimated end point. Then they closed down the program for fear it would harm the environment, and they're back to high carbon emissions. Waste of time.  Chernobyl only happened because the Russians messed up in their construction. Three Mile Island was a mistake made by somebody uninformed. The Fukishima power plant was aptly protected in case of a flood or earthquake, but nobody could've predicted both would happen at once and 40 foot waves would tackle it.  It's not sunny or windy everywhere. Wind turbines are hideous and blow up. Solar energy is nonrenewable in that it cannot be stored. Give me good reasons why I should believe that we could run entire nations on wind and solar energy alone when I know for a fact we could do it on nuclear with little to no trouble.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;My mother has worked in the nuclear industry my entire life. My step-father has worked in the nuclear industry for nearly four decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First of all, with this kind of background you probably have a significant confirmation bias towards nuclear energy. If we are going to change your view, you have to try and consider all information you have about both nuclear and solar energy objectively.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Knowing the capabilities of nuclear power and the fact that it provides the greatest amount of power per unit tells me that it&amp;#39;s more valuable than any other energy source.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What it tells me is that research into nuclear energy has turned it into the most efficient form of energy conversion available. Research into other fields might yield something better or make other processes more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chernobyl only happened because the Russians messed up in their construction.

What exactly is stoping new nuclear power plant constructions from being messed up, what is preventing someone uninfromed from making a mistake, what is to be done in unpredictable or strong disasters (note: A tsunami happening after an eartquake is common occurance, the earth quake itself was simply too strong for Fukushima.). Oh, yes, there are regulations and safety standards, but we all know how much those are ultimately worth in our money-loving society. The possibility of accidents will only rise with more power plants.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not sunny or windy everywhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need them everywhere, just like you wouldn&amp;#39;t need a nuclear power plant everywhere. Power system exist to transport power from one place to another - that works for solar just as well as for nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wind turbines are hideous&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That is very subjective. I for one find them quite elegant.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;and blow up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, as we established earlier, accidents happen. Though those accidents are quite small-scale. But less research is certainly not going to prevent accidents.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Solar energy is nonrenewable in that it cannot be stored.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Storage is not part of the definition of renewable. Renewable energy is simply energy that is continually replenished. But I think you are trying to point out the problem of the whole day-night-thing and how solar doesn&amp;#39;t quite work in the dark. That is true, humanity currently lacks an effective way of storing electicity. But after all, we aren&amp;#39;t relying on solar power alone.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Give me good reasons why I should believe that we could run entire nations on wind and solar energy alone when I know for a fact we could do it on nuclear with little to no trouble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each year of research bring new rises in efficiency and cost reduction for solar arrays and there is nothing to suggest that we are anyway close to hitting the top. As for wind power, its effectiveness relies on where it&amp;#39;s placed. Placing them for example in the sea - which, besides being windy, means they hardly obstruct people - has yielded amazing results.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s not all! Why should we rely simply on sun and wind? There are so many forms of renewable energies. It&amp;#39;s possible to herness geothermal energy and tidal energy. Tidal energy especially is barely used, despite being far more predictable than other types of renewable energy and could benefit greatly from research.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s get some numbers in here. Can we run nations just on renewable energy? So far, Iceland manages to have 80% of it&amp;#39;s power renewable, but then again, Iceland is quite small. On the other hand, Brazil manages 50% renewable, and it definitely isn&amp;#39;t small. New Zealand, Norway, Indonesia, Sweden, all a third or more, Austrie, India, Finland, Portugal, all a quarter.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All these countries manage to make a significant chunk of their energy renewable, and that&amp;#39;s even though were not even close to reaching max effiecancy for all forms of renewable energy. Who knows what can be done with more research?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure, we could go exclusively with nuclear energy. But we would be bypassing energy that is quite frankly free to take. It&amp;#39;s there, wether we take it or not, and I say, take it. The sun is bombarding our planet with free energy 24/7, and to not use it seems wasteful to me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, even though I&amp;#39;m not a fanof nuclear energy, I understand that you might not want to give it up, but then again, you don&amp;#39;t have to. Nuclear and solar aren&amp;#39;t mutually exclusive. You can have nuclear power and renewable energy, and more energy is better than less energy, at least that&amp;#39;s what I think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with nuclear is that it simply isn&amp;#39;t cost effective. In the 50&amp;#39;s it was billed as too cheap to meter. Nuclear power plants went up across the West at a startling rate, but new plants stopped being constructed almost entirely during the 70&amp;#39;s because nuclear power is just too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is that the power itself is incredibly cheap to generate. Using nuclear fission, it is possible to produce massive quantities of energy with relatively little overhead. However, nuclear has a one MASSIVE gaping drawback that makes it undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You did lay out how nuclear disasters are rare and usually the result of human error, but that ignores the true cost of the disasters. When these things go bad (and they have kept going bad, even though we know WHY they can go bad) it costs billions and billions and billions of dollars to fix it. Things keep happening, and will continue to happen, that lead to nuclear accidents. Things we can&amp;#39;t avoid, like natural disasters, and things we cause, like human error or intent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During times of conflict, nuclear reactors pretty much just turn into big targets. A terrorist could inflict massive damage on a target state by attacking a nuclear facility. An enemy state (especially one weaker in terms of might) would gain a massive advantage from targeting nuclear power installations. Not only would you knock out an incredibly large source of power, you would leave the country reeling from nuclear disaster. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Herein lies the reason nuclear is too expensive. Even though the risk of failure is low, the cost of failure is high. When it fails, it causes billions and billions of dollars in damage. The insurance premiums are likewise sky-friggin high. No rational state would go about allowing private companies to operate nuclear reactors without the ability to fix the problem if things go wrong, so massive insurance policies are required. These make nuclear energy stupidly expensive, AND only have VERY limited coverage in some cases. The United States government (and I assume the governments of other countries that operate nuclear reactors) then claim responsibility for any damage over that which is covered by insurance, costs which could easily figure in the billions of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead, wind and solar are incredibly safe (and therefore require no insurance at all, making them have greater potential for being produced cheap), and always becoming increasingly reliable. Very little money has been but into researching these technologies (especially when compared side by side to the billions in subsidies that go towards nuclear power and fossil fuel production), but there is already a lot of research being done in increasing the efficiency of solar and wind, as well as the development of technologies that allow the storage of these energies. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And despite popular belief, they are pretty damn reliable at producing energy. Solar can still produce a lot of energy when it&amp;#39;s cloudy out, and if you build wind turbines high enough, you can pretty much always get a breeze. People working in GIS have mapped out all of everywhere, and it is easy to find which areas have the highest generating capacity for wind and solar and plan accordingly. It&amp;#39;s something that is going to take a bit of time to increase the efficiency of production of energy from these sources, but it&amp;#39;s happening even with only limited government support already.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Course the thorium thing is a whole different thing, one that I don&amp;#39;t actually know all that much about. If using a different type of fuel decreases the risks involved in the production of nuclear energy, then the fuel would be cheaper to insure and therefore more cost effective. Until it becomes safer, it won&amp;#39;t be cheap enough for a growing economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: Welfare you receive isn't ""your money"", and things like food stamps that make welfare non-discretionary are a good idea.","A social safety net is a good idea, and money is spent with the intent of providing a specific kind of help. In many places this includes a cash handout. I believe this is wrong on many levels.   * The money may be misspent. This idea is NOT based on the assumption that poor people are all stupid or drug addicts. It's simply the fact that there's no way of ensuring that the cash is used for its intended purpose. The best assumption you can make is that people would be so desperately craving the thing you give them extra money for that they would almost certainly spend it on that, but people may end up endure forms of squalor that were far from what the well intentioned policy makers had in mind.   * From the government's perspective, money is also being spent inefficiently. Let's say a program wanted to ensure that people were well fed. They'd have to find a cash amount that would buy enough healthy food to feed the recipients, but people have different needs, so they'll have to provide to the upper percentile of demand (the alternative is weighing people, paying women less etc.) This not only will result in discretionary income, but inequality in how much everyone gets. A food stamp system would allow everyone to get as much food as they need, and the money left over is still in the governments hands to spend on other initiatives.  * Things like food stamps are patronising, and that's a good thing. A cash handout creates a sense of entitlement beyond what something ""patronising"" like food stamps, rent vouchers etc. create. By the time money's in your pocket or bank account, there's several layers between you and the people providing that service. Food stamps create a meaningful difference between working poor and welfare recipients to encourage escaping the system. There's also the huge benefit of less resentment of those on welfare.  * In general they communicate purpose more clearly. Too often there's an attitude of getting as much money as you can from the government, and paying as little tax as possible. It seems like people would be less likely to trick their way into receiving food stamps, education and other initiatives purpose built to meet needs. On the other side, I would think policies would allow people to see their taxes as less of a redistribution of wealth, and more as funding for benevolent programs to create a better society.  I think as much welfare as possible should be in the form of vouchers and other purpose specific, non discretionary forms. I like food stamps, I like rent vouchers, I like free healthcare and education. Things like these over cash seem like the best way to prevent the safety net becoming a fishing net. I can't think of many situations where cash is the best option, which is why I'm here.  The other aspect to this changemyview is that I'm ok with policies that ""patronise"" the less fortunate. Being well fed, healthy, comfortably sheltered, continually educated to eventually earn the life you want are more important than not being insulted. If anyone can enlighten me on what it's like to be offended by a government policy assuming you're stupid or malevolent (especially if you don't pay taxes), that would be helpful.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people on welfare can&amp;#39;t be trusted to spend welfare money efficiently, then how can you be sure that the government can? For example, is the government going to distribute different forms of welfare for things like new clothes, haircuts, utilities, etc.? These seems like it would ultimately make the welfare system more inefficient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best case scenario, food stamps will always have an additional layer of inefficiency compared to cash. You require a system to administrate food stamps, both on the government&amp;#39;s end and on the merchant&amp;#39;s end. Handing out cash cards / direct deposit requires much less overhead.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Moreover, by handing out things like rent vouchers, you highly distort the housing market. By directly subsidizing housing in such a manner, you cause incredible harm to people just outside of qualifying for the vouchers because you distort the low end of the housing market.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, the equilibrium point for rent prices on the bottom end of the market is set by what the poor can afford not the value of the property. You directly subsidize their rent, and rent will eventually rise by exactly the amount you directly subsidize them for. Whereas if you hand those on welfare cash instead of subsidized housing, a smaller percentage of the welfare will be consumed by the landlords. It gets spread around to other sectors of the economy as well. Groceries, transportation, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: I think African Americans today should be grateful for the Atlantic Slave Trade of the 18-19th Century,"Greetings Reddit,  As horrific and racist as my title sounds, I'd like to start by saying that I am hardly a racist person by nature and do not discriminate in my dealings with anyone. This is simply a belief that I've held for quite some time, based on my study of history and observation of present-day situations. Unfortunately I can't seem to bring this up without being called racist, so I'm genuinely interested in hearing a sound argument that doesn't involve that logic.   I believe that slavery gave African descendants a better future in the Americas (particularly the USA) than they would have otherwise had in Africa.   Africa was, and still is, a pretty awful place to live in. Between AIDS and other diseases, famine, civil unrest, inadequate healthcare, lack of electricity/water, and non-existent educational systems, shouldn't African Americans be glad that they are in America now and not Africa? Would today's African Americans not certainly be in a worse state if they had been born in Africa today?   I'm well aware that the initial slaves brought over had to suffer horrific atrocities and it is a tragedy that they had to be subjected to such immense terror. They clearly did not benefit. But their children? Or their grandchildren? The African Americans of today, aren't they better off because of slavery?   So that's about it, Change My View.  EDIT: Wanted to point out that I'm not a big fan of the hypothetical ""what if we hadn't gotten involved"" argument with Africa. I get that Africa *could* have been better off, but I also feel that in the time that's passed some progress could have been made as well. Other countries have done more in less time, often with poor circumstances. So that argument really hasn't worked for me.   But I'd like to say thanks to /u/fibonacciapples for putting a different spin on things by pointing out that I should consider the entirety of time between slavery and today, not just the present state of African-Americans. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

They would be like they were before. Africa, pre-colonialism, was a pretty good society. In West Africa there were many kingdoms in pre-colonialism. They had their own society. There were advanced societies, centralized governments, educational systems, judicial systems. And some parts of Africa did not have centralized government, but that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean they were worse off. Who&amp;#39;s to say we&amp;#39;re better off than hunter gatherers? Google &amp;quot;What would Africa be like without slavery/without colonization&amp;quot; and click around. It&amp;#39;s quite interesting to speculate about.

CMV: There's nothing wrong with surgically altering the genitals of intersex infants,"This is inspired by [an article on TIL](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2lvqfa/til_a_couple_were_in_the_process_of_adopting_a_1/) so I will quote that for starters:  &gt; TIL a couple were in the process of adopting a 1 yr old intersexed child with both male &amp; female genitalia. While still in foster care, the state allowed a sexual reassignment surgery on the child. They removed his penis &amp; testicles. The child now identifies as male. His parents are suing the state.  The comments section on this post was overwhelmingly filled with rage against the state for performing what some term ""mutilation"" on this child, as well as countless comparisons to [David Reimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer). I am baffled by the response to the article and disagree with the Reimer comparison, so I would like my view changed.  For starters, I think Reimer is completely irrelevant to the case at hand. He was born male and his sex change was the result of a botched circumcision. He then suffered bizarre forms of so-called ""therapy"" that included a doctor forcing him and his twin brother to rehearse sexual acts. We can all agree this whole situation is fucked up and should serve as a lesson for all medical professionals. But I don't see why that implies sex reassignment surgery on children is inherently evil.  Unlike Reimer, this child was not born with a single sex and then reassigned to a different one.  He also wasn't forced into traumatic pseudoscientific behavioral therapy. From what I read, it sounds like he was raised like any normal girl would be. I think the comparisons to Reimer are an example of the Reddit hivemind desperately seeking comparisons for what they perceive to be medical malpractice.  I'm certainly open to being convinced Reimer's case is relevant, but it's not the important part of my view.  As stated in the title, I don't see anything wrong with what the doctors in this case did. The child was born with both sets of genitals and they made the decision he should be a girl. Let's look at some alternative scenarios.  First, if the child identified as female we would not be discussing it. I suspect this type of surgery happens quite often and the child grows up like any other member of their assigned gender. It's functionally the same as if they had been born that way.  If the intersex child hadn't received surgery, he would have grown up with ambiguous genitalia. Then he could have decided at a later time to be male, female, or whatever, along with the corresponding surgery or lack thereof. This is what all the commenters say should have happened, and it's what I disagree with.  I can only speculate on what that life would be like (so if you have experienced this personally you can probably change my view quite easily) but it sounds pretty terrible to me. Growing up is hard enough, especially dealing with body and gender issues. I'm not saying you should be embarrassed to be intersex, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't have been embarrassed about it if I were 12 years old and my genitals didn't look like anyone else's. And much as I think our society's gender roles are too rigid and need to be loosened, it doesn't change the fact that identifying with a particular gender makes puberty much easier.  Worst of all, I can't imagine having both sets of genitals and identifying as a specific gender. That leaves you with the choice of getting major surgery as an adult (as a guy, the thought of getting my dick cut off even for such an important part of my life sounds horrific) or being stuck in a body you don't feel comfortable in.  Note that in the case in question the child doesn't identify as intersex: he identifies as male. If he had both sets of genitals, he would currently be as unhappy as he is with just a vagina. The only difference is apparently FTM surgery is much harder than MTF, but that just tells me the doctors should have made him a male at birth (so he had the option to become female later) rather than leaving him intersex.  Therefore if I was born intersex I would rather have gender ~~re~~assignment surgery ASAP. If doctors make the right choice, great. If they make the wrong choice, I'm no different from any other trans person.  By the way, I'm not saying intersex infants should *have* to receive surgery. If the parents want to raise their child intersex, I guess that's their choice just like they're free to raise a child with a penis as a girl. I think such parents would be making a shitty choice, and if my parents did that I would be mad at them, but again I'm not going to bother arguing any surgery should be mandatory. I'm just saying it's not inherently wrong to perform the surgery.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

That&amp;#39;s how many intersex people feel about having their genitals surgically modified. They don&amp;#39;t all feel that way I&amp;#39;m sure, but the fact that some can feel that way makes it unethical.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me go ahead and make a con list. One of the main reasons to do normalizing surgeries is to hide the intersex condition so let me go ahead and assume you won&amp;#39;t be telling them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cons:  You will likely end up with painful scar tissue and lost sensation to the point where they might not feel anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They could very well notice the differences and feel like a freak and have no explanation as to why they are different.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The surgeries aren&amp;#39;t always done in one go and happen over the course of years sometimes they will go on till the infant is a toddler and can remember things as such will likely remember the memories as very traumatizing moments. The stories from people who remember this stuff are horrible. Most will have a fear or distrust of the medical community as a whole thus potentially making them not see care when they need it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A lot of intersex people have no desire for surgery and accept that they&amp;#39;re a bit different. There&amp;#39;s no reason they can&amp;#39;t live a healthy happy life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you get it wrong they have to transition and if they don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s up with them they might not find out until far later in life. Trust me when I say one puberty sucks you don&amp;#39;t want a second. Some changes can&amp;#39;t be undone and the surgery may have compromised the tissue that could be used for surgery later on if they desire it. The reactions for an intersex person telling their family they&amp;#39;re transitioning is pretty much the same for trans people. They might accept it but there&amp;#39;s always going to be a few who don&amp;#39;t. The intersex condition means nothing and they will completely ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You could make them infertile or force them on hormones for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over all there might be a few who are happy with the surgery and there might be a few who are just kinda ok with it but you&amp;#39;re going to get far too many who are not ok with it for it to be worth doing and there is no reason to not wait till they can decide for themselves or at least partake in the conversation. I know a lot of people don&amp;#39;t like letting a 12 yr old decide thing like that but it&amp;#39;s sure as hell better then them getting no say at all. The idea that there is only male or female is a rather troublesome idea anyways and riddled with problems so why not let intersex kids shine?

CMV: I believe God is a completely illogical concept with no basis in reality and was created solely to help us cope with our mortality.,"Before you dismiss me as some angsty teenage atheist, please hear me out. I am actually interested in having my view changed.  First, let me give you a little background to explain why I feel the way that I do about the concept of a supernatural being, particularly those held as deities by the major world religions. I was raised in a somewhat fundamentalist Christian household, and I fully believed the majority of what I was taught until around the age of 16. Even when I would question some things, I could usually find satisfactory answers to my questions through research or by talking to a pastor, youth group leader, family member or friend. However, as I got older and was became friends with people who held world views that starkly contradicted my own, I started questioning some of the more basic concepts of my faith- not out of rebellion or disdain, but simply out of a desire to learn more. In fact, at this point I thought that it was simply God’s way of making me a stronger Christian, and that once I found the answers I was looking for I would be able to confidently explain them to anyone who asked me the same questions. However, as time went on, I continued to pray, read, and talk about the doubts I was having, but I ended up coming to the conclusion that there were irreconcilable contradictions within the Bible and within the concept of God (or at least the God of Christianity, at that point). When I stopped believing in God, it was not a decision, but simply a realization that I no longer thought that the things I had learned my entire life were completely true.   That all happened a few years back. Since then I have had a few back-and-forth periods between trying to believe again and completely rejecting anything having to do with religion, but as I spent more time at college and had more time to think about and explore my beliefs, I have started to feel more and more that the idea of God is no more than a fairy tale to help people feel better about a world and a life that can be somewhat bleak at times. I still try to respect my family’s beliefs, because they really do try to respect mine as well, but the more time I spend apart from the church, the more I realize how silly it all sounds to me. Additionally, I have now had some time to look into other religions as well, and despite their differences (and my admittedly limited knowledge of them compared to Christianity), I find that most of them fall into the same category- fantastical stories, which are well-intentioned and (arguably) decent as moral guides, but most likely largely fictional. I acknowledge that most of the figureheads of the religions (i.e. Jesus, Muhammad, etc.) were real people, but I think they were nothing more than philosophical leaders who were deified after their deaths.   So now that I’ve explained why I don’t believe in any god, here is what I do believe. I believe that science represents the best of our knowledge and understanding of the world. While we do not know everything, and we never will, I do not see that as a reason to fill in the gaps with supernatural explanation. As long as we continue to pursue more knowledge and advancement through the rigor of scientific experimentation and theory, we will learn as much as we can about the universe we live in, and that is good enough for me. I believe that when we die, we simply cease to exist, and as such I believe it is important to make as much out of this life as possible. I believe that any religion is a largely primitive and illogical construct created simply out of the human desire to believe that there is more to life than meets the eye, and that religion as a whole will largely disappear at some point in the future of the human race.  You could change my view by convincing me of one of a few things. (A) I have only completely rejected religion because of my fundamentalist upbringing, and a lesser form of Christianity or some other religion might fit into a logical view of the world. (B) Science and religion (specifically one of the major world religions) are not mutually exclusive, and can instead complement one another for a more complete understanding of life. I should add that simply stating that believing in God would be a good thing will not be enough. Just because something would be nice or convenient does not mean I can force myself to believe it.  Addendum: In case anyone is wondering, the reason I want to have my view changed is simple. Where I live, most people are religious, and I feel that it would greatly help my relationship with a lot of people if I at least believed in something, even if I never return to a full belief in Christianity. Furthermore, I am currently dating a girl who is absolutely amazing and with whom I mesh perfectly in just about every other way, but she is a Christian (although not nearly as fundamentalist as my family) and has expressed some concern about my lack of faith. While she has not tried at all to push me towards changing that aspect of myself, I would hate for that to be the one thing that stands between us and long term happiness, so I’m taking the initiative. That may seem like a cheap reason to want to change my entire world view, but it is what it is- and honestly, maybe having something to believe in wouldn’t be so bad for me.  So there you have it. I may be barking up the wrong tree since I know reddit doesn’t have a whole lot of outspoken religious people, but if anyone feels up to the challenge, please Change My View.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You just list the reasons why you personally don&amp;#39;t believe in Christianity. I went through the exact same phase as you (Christian upbringing, around 16 started questioning, started going to &lt;a href=""/r/atheism""&gt;/r/atheism&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). But declaring &amp;quot;God doesn&amp;#39;t exist and if you disagree you&amp;#39;re an idiot!&amp;quot; is just as illogical as saying &amp;quot;God exists and if you disagree you&amp;#39;re going to hell!&amp;quot;. You don&amp;#39;t know for a certainty if a deity exists because by definition supernatural things can&amp;#39;t be examined or explained. You think that specific stories in the Bible are BS, sure.

Even Christians acknowledge that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to disagree with your assertion that gods are just a product of our fear of death (although certain ones are, and I believe that the Christian god falls under that net).  Humans naturally seek to explain the world around us.  There&amp;#39;s a reason that creation myths exist in every culture to explain the origins of the things around us.  We fear what we cannot know, so we try to deal with that by believing that we know it.  In the modern era, this has become less pronounced because the things we do not know have much less relation to our daily lives.  Death is the only exception, and this may be part of the reason for the surge in popularity of the three primary monotheistic religions over the past two millennia.  So, when we had a question but no basis by which to find the answer, such as the scientific method, we just found an answer that made sense.  It didn&amp;#39;t have to be proven or demonstrated, it just had to fit with what we thought of the world.  As a story is passed down, it gains authority and can morph into more of a truth than a story.  So, yes, religion and faith are illogical by the rules of the scientific method, but they were our earliest attempts at discovery - a representation of the human spirit, if an outdated one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"CMV: If we discover a species of aliens that at the time is less advanced than us, but is clearly more intelligent and will surpass us in technology in the future, the correct course of action would be to wipe that species out while we have the chance.","My thinking here is that if an alien species is simply ""better"" than us, but behind in terms of technology for the time being, then it would be an imperative to drive that species to extinction in the small window of opportunity that we have or else that species will eventually surpass us and our destiny will no longer be in our own control.  Even if the species may be peaceful in nature, I feel like loss of sovereignty/self-determination will become inevitable, as if the alien species disagrees with us on an issue and feels strongly about it, then they can just use their now superior military might to force their point of view.  On the other hand, if humanity remains the most intelligent species in the galaxy with all other known species less intelligent than we are, we would be able to forge our own destiny much easier.  I would like to have someone attempt to change my view, as I am personally uncomfortable with my own position at the moment.  Edits:  1) Final response to the ""interbreeding"" option: I do not think this is a valid option to maintain human self determination in the face of a superior alien species as interbreeding with the aliens would create offspring that I do not consider human. If ""humanity"" attempted to match the alien species through interbreeding, I would consider this extinction.  2) NuclearShadow has succeeded in changing my opinion by stressing that other species that are possibly already more advanced than us would look down upon genocidal activity, and might wipe us out in return. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I believe that all schools in all stages of education should be free. CMV,"Just to be clear, I believe that no one should be **able** to pay for school (except for extra curricular things like excursions).  I believe that the money which goes into schools and universities should come from our taxes and that schools should receive an amount of money depending on the amount of students attending it.  The problem I have with the current system is that wealthier families send their kids to private schools and many poorer families are forced to send their kids to public schools. Whilst public schools can still be good, I don't see why any child should receive a better education than any other child, no matter how much money they have.  If all schools were free to attend then eventually, I predict all schools would become much more equal, meaning that everyone would receive a much more equal education, which could eventually close the gap between rich and poor rather than widen it the way it does now.  I assume this would be incredibly difficult to implement, but could it still work in theory?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lived in a country where all education was free.  I was even getting paid a stipend while attending university.  The quality of education was good, and the fact that it was free was a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there is no such thing as free lunch.  Somebody still has to pay for it.  The government that paid teachers&amp;#39; salaries took this money from my parents by paying them way less than free market would (most jobs were controlled by the government, so the government set salaries).  The government also was notoriously inefficient, wasting money and resources.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So I would rather pay for education directly rather than pay the government and let it pay for the education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schooling system in my country(Slovenia) is almost exactly as you described. Education is free from primary school all the way up to phd. Everything is funded by taxpayers money so basically the only thing you need to pay for are books and pens. While attending university you also get different benefits like tax reduction if you decide to work, coupons for lunch so you don&amp;#39;t have to pay the full price for your meal, cheaper monthly tickets for public transport, etc. Schools with tuition do exist. However their courses haven&amp;#39;t been tested yet so there is no guarantee you will get a job when you get the degree.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand such a system has considerable amount of flaws. Many people decide to abuse it for years so they enroll in a university solely for benefits, therefore they don&amp;#39;t actually attend classes. Because of the crisis the government can&amp;#39;t spend the same amounts of money for education, so they decided to cut teachers salaries. Consequently many of them became overburdened with responsibilities and extremely unhappy with their position, which decreased the quality of education. Many people also study for professions that don&amp;#39;t have any demand on the market.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To sum up, free education may seem like a good idea, however it cost a lot of money for the government(ours is almost bankrupt) and decreases the quality of education for everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: I don’t support campaigns like the Dove “Real Beauty” campaign and those similar. Change my view.,"Every time I see a commercial for the Dove “Real Beauty” campaign I get rather annoyed an offended. These commercials portray women who are supposed to represent what “real beauty” is. The eight or nine women featured are of average height and vary in skin tones, but are all “curvy”. None of them are what people would consider skinny or thin. I don’t think anyone would label them as athletic or incredibly fit, nor would anyone say they are obese.   My issue here is that many people have tried to convince the world that no matter what size you are, you’re beautiful and should love your body. That being said, this commercial shows one type of body, rather curvy and maybe even verging on slightly overweight.   Is real beauty not being thin, even though you may happen to have a high metabolism or eat healthy foods? Is real beauty not being athletic or strong or muscular? Are we saying that it’s okay to have extra fat on your bodies because “no matter what size you are, you’re beautiful”?  I realize that many people can’t help what size they are no matter what they do, and I’m not saying that being stick thin or anorexic is okay either, and I don’t agree with modeling agencies that promote models being underweight. What I don’t support is companies saying that real beauty is being round and curvy when in actuality, that may not be very healthy and shouldn't be settled for.   I think women should try and be their best self, fit, healthy, active, and strong. I think these women should be praised and promoted. Although everyone should be confident in their own skin and should never dislike who they are, I don’t think it’s okay to except being overweight because “real women have curves”.

It&amp;#39;s not saying &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s okay to be obese&amp;quot; - it&amp;#39;s saying &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s okay to love yourself even if you&amp;#39;re not perfectly fit.&amp;quot; Physical perfection, and the quest for it, aren&amp;#39;t the only worthwhile things in life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You have no right to dictate other people&amp;#39;s priorities. You think women should &amp;quot;try and be their best self, fit, healthy, active, and strong&amp;quot;? Okay, and I think it&amp;#39;s more important for women (and men!) to pursue &amp;quot;the life of the mind&amp;quot;: a full, rich, expansive, fascinating &lt;em&gt;intellectual&lt;/em&gt; life - a life rich in new experiences, in deep and meaningful relationships, in education and expansion of their worldview. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Does everyone have time for all of that? Nope. Your priorities are valid - &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt;. My priorities are valid - &lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt;. Neither one of us gets to make that call for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally: about a month ago the major news outlets picked up a story about how fat-shaming doesn&amp;#39;t work - &lt;a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/09/11/fat-shaming-doesnt-work-a-new-study-says/""&gt;here&amp;#39;s the Washington Post article&lt;/a&gt;, but if you Google &amp;quot;fat shaming doesn&amp;#39;t work&amp;quot; you&amp;#39;ll see links to a bunch more. So if telling people that they&amp;#39;re fat and disgusting doesn&amp;#39;t work... maybe telling them that they&amp;#39;re worthwhile &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt;? You object to the campaign telling people to love their bodies - but don&amp;#39;t you take better care of the things that you love?? If you think your body is worthless shit, why would you care what you put in it? And conversely, if you love it - won&amp;#39;t you be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; likely to take care of it?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Overweight people are &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; surrounded by endless messages of &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re disgusting&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re lazy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re worthless&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re weak&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re stupid&amp;quot; and so on, and so forth. Tell me: how well is that working, on a societal scale? How well if that curtailing the obesity epidemic? &lt;em&gt;We&amp;#39;ve already tried it your way&lt;/em&gt;, and that way &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#39;t work&lt;/em&gt;. If you&amp;#39;re really serious about combating the obesity epidemic (as opposed to basking in righteous superiority), wouldn&amp;#39;t you be open to trying something &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;, just on the off-chance that it may actually help? You know the saying: the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over and expecting different results.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;[As an aside, and to preclude any sort of ad hominem replies, let me just say that I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; overweight, but dropped 50 lbs last year and am now in the optimal weight range for my height/age. I try to be active, but going to the gym is not an option for time/money/attention-span reasons. I do feel better - physically and emotionally - and would definitely recommend it....

If your body looks like you could be a Victoria&amp;#39;s Secret model, there is plenty of positive reinforcement, through advertising, actors, etc.  The point of the campaign is to point out that, while those &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; women are beautiful, so, too are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; (the 40-year old mom watching the ad on TV or seeing it in a magazine, who might have given up buying &amp;quot;beauty&amp;quot; products because they won&amp;#39;t help them look like a model).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yes- the campaign&amp;#39;s purpose is to &lt;em&gt;gasp&lt;/em&gt; sell more product.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it is a good thing too.  It&amp;#39;s not intended to either ostracize athletes like you, or to discourage exercise.  It&amp;#39;s to cut down a little on the self loathing if a busy life doesn&amp;#39;t all for regular workouts (which is pretty common for working moms).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s wrong with that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
I don't think it's wrong for a girl to be slutty and promiscuous provided that she practises safe sex and birth control. CMV,"I don't see why women that have lots of sex (usually not with the same person) are  looked down upon. Sex is something that all enjoy and that can be simply practiced for pleasure.   As long as she or her partner use a condom,and she isn't cheating / sleeping with a person already in  a relationship,  I really don't see the problem. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A problem is that use of a condom is risk management, it doesn&amp;#39;t remove risk. All the risks that are present without condoms are still present with them, just to a lesser extent. So, promiscuity is a potential health hazard, even with safe sex.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Additionally, it&amp;#39;s easy to wind up with different goals with sex partners, people who initially wanted no strings attached can wind up unintentionally attached. These things have a nasty tendency to explode socially, which makes them rather disruptive. It might work out just fine the vast majority of the time, but it only requires a couple of situations to end in shouting matches, broken friendships, feuds, or cases of stalking for the community to have a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A strong selection process can carefully manage these issues to the point where I would argue that someone could successfully do so an not be socially disruptive or a vector for disease. The problem is this is at loggerheads with the goal of having lots of sex, either one limits sex in one a variety of ways and reaches a balance with society at large or one does not limit sex and does provoke social pressure to do so. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Guys who do likewise are also looked down upon, largely for the same reason. It&amp;#39;s just not as pronounced because of a biased cultural inheritance. So it&amp;#39;s not something all that gender specific.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrong or not, here is a friend&amp;#39;s (#1) experience with another slutty female friend (#2):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friend #2 is slutty, so brings a different date to each event. Requiring friend #1 to constantly interact with new people at parties/events where it is supposed to be close friends only&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friend #2 is slutty, so sleeps with other male friends of female friend #1, forcing situation where friend #1 must &amp;#39;Choose sides&amp;#39; and ruined friendship with the guy friend, who she really liked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friend #2 is never available to do things as a &amp;#39;couple&amp;#39; with friend #1 who is in a committed relationship, because friend #2, is never in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every evening spent with friend #2 becomes about her dating life. This is normal in female friendships, when one member of a group has a new relationship. But, because friend #2, is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; in the throes of a new relationship/partner, she manipulates the groups &amp;#39;new relationship&amp;#39; time. and causes drama. Like the time when she had to use emergency contraceptives. OR the guy turned crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going out for a &amp;#39;girls night&amp;#39; ends up with #2 hooking up with someone, leaving friend #1 to go home early, or be alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women also often don&amp;#39;t trust promiscuous women to be around their own partners. Its why &amp;#39;slutty&amp;#39; girls only hang out with other &amp;#39;slutty&amp;#39; girls. And why girls in long term, committed relationships i.e.e &amp;#39;nice girls&amp;#39;, don&amp;#39;t enjoy spending time with &amp;#39;slutty&amp;#39; girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, while I wouldn&amp;#39;t argue that its &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt; (because right and wrong are so vague, anyways), I would say it is socially unacceptable, and that these are some examples of why. I would also like to point out, that I  think it has &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; to do with jealousy. I think it is about preserving social structure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
I believe that the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan was justified and was better than the alternatives. CMV,"Throughout the last months of the Pacific conflict, the US navy and air force were carrying out heavy bombing campaigns against Japanese targets, such as Tokyo and Kyoto. These included firebombings and incredibly destructive attacks on mainly civilian targets. Some historians speculate that up to 400,000 Japanese civilians were killed in two months of firebombing alone. The US would have continued these bombings in the event that they did not end the war with the bomb, or through some other means. The dropping of the bombs signaled the end of the war, and therefore, prevented even more civilian casualties. Therefore, it was completely justified and should not be as controversial as it is. Change my view, I'm open to any angle or argument, just try to stay as un-biased as possible. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something being justified doesn&amp;#39;t make it not terrible. Even if the bombings saved lots of lives, they were a terrible, terrible result. Even if they were the best possible result they still sucked.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So I want to pick up on this bit (and thank you for including it so I can say this without violating Rule 1):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore, it was completely justified and should not be as controversial as it is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even if it was justified, which I won&amp;#39;t pose an opinion on as I&amp;#39;m not an expert, the bombings should - no, &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be controversial. They sucked, they were horrible, and we need to keep talking about them because (a) we need to devise better solutions to conflict and (b) both sides are human, and the way we deal with horrible things is to talk about them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bombings are controversial because the targets were civilians, and the &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Bombing_Survey""&gt;Strategic bombing survey&lt;/a&gt; later deemed them to be militarily unnecessary. There are generally accepted rules of war, and targeting civilians is considered off the table. Curtis LeMay, who was very involved with the Pacific theatre during WWII, once said to Robert McNamara that if the US had lost the war, he was certain he&amp;#39;d have been tried as a war criminal. McNamara agreed, and went on to write about the incident, adding, &amp;quot;But what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Allow me to quote &lt;a href=""http://members.peak.org/%7Edanneng/decision/usnews.html""&gt;Leo Szilard&lt;/a&gt;, a man much smarter than myself, on this topic:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let me say only this much to the moral issue involved: Suppose Germany had developed two bombs before we had any bombs. And suppose Germany had dropped one bomb, say, on Rochester and the other on Buffalo, and then having run out of bombs she would have lost the war. Can anyone doubt that we would then have defined the dropping of atomic bombs on cities as a war crime, and that we would have sentenced the Germans who were guilty of this crime to death at Nuremberg and hanged them?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But, again, don&amp;#39;t misunderstand me. The only conclusion we can draw is that governments acting in a crisis are guided by questions of expediency, and moral considerations are given very little weight, and that America is no different from any other nation in this respect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: The existence of government structures are inherently flawed and do not serve the needs of people and are destructive by nature.,"After reading Michael Hoffman's *[The Entheogen Theory of Religion and Ego Death](http://www.egodeath.com/EntheogenTheoryOfReligion.htm)*, I have come across the opinion that organized religion has created governing bodies that then go back and alter the original religion and that the purpose of the governing body is in turn lost as the purpose of the religion is distorted to serve the whim of the governing body.  In turn, it calls for attempts of society to become ""self governing"" as the ultimate goal, in the belief that ones moral guidance will be astray regardless of an established government and that moral guidance is an innate part of human existence, and the idea of sin is inherently flawed in that one can not acknowledge ones behavior as sinful without also regarding it as destined.  Michael Hoffman's essay has lead me to believe that governments should not exist, and I agree. CMW. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Did you do this by yourself? no, of course not. It is nearly impossible to move a couch completely solo.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are tasks that are larger than moving couches. These, by extension, need more people working on them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are, in fact, tasks that everyone needs to do, that must be done by working together. Sometimes, people can find ways off making money doing these things, and will form businesses. But not always.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One thing today is exceptionally hard to make a profit at is the task of keeping some Jackass from gathering a bunch of other jackasses together, and  just taking your property. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tasks such as this are ideally suited to efforts that equally involve everyone. These efforts, whether you want then to or not, end up being defacto governments.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even if you did have a private company doing things for the collective good, it would behave mostly life a government does now.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The morality that Hoffman proposes would be fantastic. But long experience has shown that in general, humans cannot be trusted to never screw over other humans. In fact, it may be logically impossible to never screw someone over.

When I walk down the street, the government stops (or tries to stop) anyone from shooting me and taking my stuff. I don&amp;#39;t have to hire guards to protect my house 24/7 because breaking into it would be illegal.

CMV: People that pay full retail price for clothing are stupid and non-resourceful.,"I can get the same clothing from my favorite brands (Gap, J Crew, Ralph Lauren, etc.) for nearly half the price, maybe even less, on the clearance racks. There are people out there that actually pay 20$ for a tshirt or 40$ or more for a dress shirt. Why do they do this? Is it a lack of caring or are they wealthy enough to pay full price?  Coming from a family that is far from wealthy, frugalness has been a learned trait. Having the want to have nice clothing has given my mom the chance to teach me how to shop frugally. Just yesterday I went to Gap and got a polo for .97. Why would people pay full price when they can get it for a buck?  So reddit, could you change my view?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I generally do browse clearance racks first, and thrift stores as well. But I&amp;#39;m a smaller guy and in our hefty world, I don&amp;#39;t have many options.

I don't believe that war is ever justifiable. CMV.,"For context: I am Canadian.      I'll break this position down into sections from narrow to broad.    1. I don't believe that war is ever justifiable for me, personally.  Meaning I would never go to war for my country or to the aid of another country.  The personal cost to my psyche of taking another human life outweighs any ideal of nationalism, defence, or 'aid'.  2. I don't believe that war can be justified in our present global context.  Meaning that any current war or war that might be started in the future is not justifiable.     I feel that current conflicts are fueled  by constant chest-puffing by countries demonstrating their military fortitude.  Just as the US feels threatened by a country like Iran with a differing national ideology building up a nuclear arsenal, Iran feels threatened by the US's already massive nuclear arsenal.   Border/Land conflicts where both countries have a legitimate claim should be negotiated to a compromise.  Any attempt to claim/annex new land should be responded to with sanctions and cutting off trade etc. Any civil conflict where a people uprises against an oppressive ruling power should be non-violent.  Violence perpetrated against the peaceful revolutionaries can/should/will be shown to the world (technological connectedness) and other countries should again respond by cutting off ties, and neighbouring countries taking in refugees.   In a situation where a country is attacked by the forces of another country, I don't believe that a retaliatory war is justifiable.  Again, cutting ties to the country is the appropriate response.   A country that shows aggression will not be able to show prolonged aggression if they are shut out of global trade - resources will run dry.  3. I don't believe that any war has ever been justifiable.  I am not a huge history buff, but I truly believe that no war has ever been necessary.  So, to summarize:   I believe that peaceful solutions are present in any conflict and the choice to go to war is never justifiable.   Point 3. is most likely to change, then point 2., and point 1. is most likely to remain as it is.  That said, feel free to challenge any or all of my views, and liberally cite any bygone battles, current conflicts, or future fallouts that may support your points!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without wars, the world would be much less interesting. Conflicts and problems give many of our lives meaning and purpose which might not otherwise exist. If everybody was peaceful and kind to each other and there were no global problems, life would be pretty boring and pointless. There need to be villains for heroes to exist and we must overcome war to truly appreciate peace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would agree that the beginnings of almost all wars are not justifiable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But what about WWII when Germany attacked. Should the US have continued to allow the Germans to kill the Jews and the Japanese to slaughter the Chinese? The US tried cutting ties with Japan and Germany but that did not matter.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US also knew that if they allowed Germany to take over Europe and Japan to rule Asia then it would be only a matter of time before the Axis attacked the US.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also remember that Europe tried your peaceful means with Germany prior to WWII. They tried to cut of trade and have economic slaps on the wrist. They tried appeasement. And because they pussy footed around millions of innocent unnecessary lives where lost.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Would you rather have had England and France to put up no resistance when Germany came to their borders simply because they were against war?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I believe the Death Star is a space ship and not a space station. CMV,"There's been a fair debate on this and I still cannot bring myself to consider this beast a space station.  This started the debate. [Space Ship Size Comparison chart.](http://i.imgur.com/KsJac7f.jpg)  I had read many of the series of books regarding Star Wars, watched the movies, and from those, I can determine that the Death Star has a Space Ship type propulsion system.  Comparing stations in Star Wars and Star Trek, the most common factor for space stations is that they do not have inter galactic propulsion capabilities. They require building on site, or being tugged to location.  The Death Star has the capability of hyperspace travel because it has banks of hyperdrive field generators. [One Source](http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/death-star6.htm)  [Here is a list of destroyed planets in the Star Wars universe.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_destroyed_planets)  The prototype of the death star destroyed a moon. After the first build of the Ship they destroyed Despayre and had to travel there using hyperdrive. After that they had to travel in range to destroy Alderaan. Because of the ability to travel in hyperspace is what made it such a threat for the rebels and had to be destroyed.  A Space Station sits, and needs to be tugged to locations, they normally cannot travel, and if they did, it would be at extremely low speeds because they are not meant for space travel and will rip themselves apart if traveling at light speed.  [This wiki classifies it as a battlestation.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Death_Star)  I believe the Death Star, as a battlestation, should also be considered a Space Ship and not a Space Station. I do not think it should be considered a battlestation either because of it's ability to travel like a space ship. Maybe someone with extensive knowledge of Star Wars could possibly Change my view.  EDIT : I'm now convinced it is a Space Station, but no ordinary space station, it's an *ARMORED MOBILE* Space Station. [Final Proof](http://i.imgur.com/XHd22Ia.png)  EDIT 2 : [Here's the big picture](http://i.imgur.com/Kui8Baq.jpg)","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think what delineates a space station vs. a space ship is more what it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; for rather than what its capabilities are.  Yes, the Death Star has the &lt;em&gt;ability&lt;/em&gt; to move through space, and even to make hyperspace jumps, but its primary function is to act as a space station. It is a base for the Empire, receiving, refueling, and resupplying ship of all sizes, and it contains a major artillery-style weapon rather than the weapons a space ship (like an X-wing or a TIE fighter) would have. It also has defense guns--not meant to be used like the aforementioned space ship lasers (that is, offensively), but rather meant to be used for defending the station from assault. So while it may be specifically considered a &lt;em&gt;mobile&lt;/em&gt; space station due to its hyperdrive banks, the Death Star is a space station nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of common sense, it&amp;#39;s a space station because it&amp;#39;s round, basically.

Yes, it can move, but it&amp;#39;s stationary for every fight it&amp;#39;s in, right?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you put hyperspace drives on earth and used those to move earth to a different solar system, would that make earth a space ship?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
I do not think that gaming qualifies as a form of artistic expression. CVM,"Time and again I see my ""gamer"" friends whittling away their lives in front of the latest Call of Duty or whatever. When I ask them about it, I get some kind of one-off explanation about how it's all art. Sure, actually making games qualifies as some kind of art, but I wouldn't sit in front of the mona lisa for 6 hours a day and consider myself a painter.   Edit to clarify a little: Video games are art, but I have seen people play video games excessively to the extent where it becomes a major aspect of their lives and validate their ""gaming"" by stating that it is an art form. All consumption and no production negates this excuse in my opinion.   **Final Edit: I didn't know what to expect from this, but holy cow am I humbled. I was in the mindset that art and art appreciation must manifest itself in the same way (i.e. If you collect paintings, you must be a painter for that to be meaningful.) I now see that any kind of art appreciation (including gaming) is bound to find another outlet. While I still do not think gaming is the pinnacle of artistic expression, I do recognize it as one now. I definitely see it as legitimate art appreciation. That was totally unexpected, reddit. Thanks for changing my view!**   also: video games = complicated chess","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ya, I think you misunderstood them. Gaming is appreciating art if you define that game as art. Also the word art has multiple definitions. &amp;quot;Art&amp;quot; can also be synonymous with &amp;quot;Skill&amp;quot; and some gamers are incredibly skilled. Although I think you can definitely make art in some games. &lt;a href=""http://i.imgur.com/Iv2V9.jpg""&gt;Minecraft&lt;/a&gt; being a &lt;a href=""http://imgur.com/QjF76""&gt;really&lt;/a&gt; good &lt;a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/Jem23""&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.

I believe public welfare does more harm than good. CMV,"Let me start by saying that I think a social safety net is a beautiful and noble idea. If it were used properly, it would assist people who have fallen on hard times until they can get back on their feet. Unfortunately, in the US, that idea doesn't seem to be working very well.  I believe that government support simply creates a culture of laziness and a mentality of entitlement. I believe it makes people weaker and is just another tool used by those in power to control and suppress the stupid masses. When someone has to fend for themselves, they become stronger. When someone else feeds them, they lose the ability to feed themselves. But people do enjoy handouts (everyone does, even the wealthiest) and by throwing them a bite, it's easy to get their votes. It makes people complacent and less likely to push themselves to learn new skills and persevere.  ***I know anecdotal evidence isn't proof of anything, but neither are statistics so don't get on that ""anecdotal evidence train"" because it's still evidence.***  I know an immigrant who came here and started working at a pizza place. He had no real skills, but he knew he wasn't going to get  government assistance so he got himself a job and did it well. Later he started doing tile and flooring work with no previous experience. He worked hard because he knew there was no safety net for him. He supported a family of three with an income of 28K and now they live better than some Americans who earn twice that. Why? Because his family has their priorities straight and knows how to manage money. I believe that is because they know that there is no one to take care of them.  I also have a friend who owns a small business. She offers health insurance, retirement account benefits, and even tuition assistance for her employees. Very few take those offers, especially the last one. I would argue that the last one is the one most likely to help them get a better job, but people are lazy because of the entitlement culture here in the US. They truly believe that they deserve something for nothing. They think the world owes them something. I believe that this mentality is caused by welfare programs.  On a somewhat different note, I also believe that corporate welfare is just as terrible, if not worse. It props up businesses that should fail. It allows major corporations to make destructive decisions that can harm the whole economy. If any welfare were the end, this should be the first to go.  EDIT: My view has mostly been changed in regards to welfare making people lazy and entitled. I think it probably does have that effect on some people, but most seem to benefit greatly and remain productive members of society. I still think corporate welfare is terrible.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no real knowledge about the American public welfare system, so please pardon any eventual ignorance from my part. I&amp;#39;ll try to argue from my experience as someone that was born in Brazil, spent my childhood in Guatemala, and then moved to Sweden at the age of ten, where I reside today. I have gone from living in a privileged position in a country with virtually &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt; public welfare, to a low-middle class on in the country that probably has the most extensive public welfare system in the world. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe that government support simply creates a culture of laziness and a mentality of entitlement. When someone has to fend for themselves, they become stronger. When someone else feeds them, they lose the ability to feed themselves. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a sense, you are right. It does make people feel entitled to what they consider to be fundamental rights, as virtue of being human. It makes people believe that no children should have a lesser opportunity in life based on the fact that they where born in the wrong family. It makes people outraged if a child should be denied a qualitative education, healthcare, or decent living conditions based on where they are born and what monetary means their parents happen to have. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And in a sense, it also makes them lazy. Whilst I was attending school, peers of my same age with poorer families (often of mayan decent) in Guatemala would go from street light to street light doing circus tricks for money (a very common and vivid memory from my childhood) or helping their parents out in the field. In order for their families to survive, they had to work hard from the moment they where able to. One of the cleaning ladies at my mothers office, who later became a close friend of the family, only passed third grade. And she is not some isolated incident: as late is 2011, only &lt;a href=""http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/guatemala.htm""&gt;30%&lt;/a&gt; of those attending the primary level of education graduate from it. That&amp;#39;s the drop-out rate for the high school level of education in Sweden. An education they are not only given for free (in Guatemala, this stops at year 6) - they are also given meals, books and transportation. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If society has a good, well functioning safety net, people don&amp;#39;t have to only focus on surviving. They can send their kids to school, knowing that they will be fed a meal. If they get laid off, or have a bad year in the fields, they don&amp;#39;t have to pull the kids from school in order to work. If there is guaranteed standard of living, children can realize their full potential, regardless of background. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So I believe that you are right - in a society without welfare, people are carved into rigid, strong individuals fending for themselves at young age in order to survive that harsh, dog eat dog world they live in. While we citizens of the nany state do not know how it is to work at young age, come to expect certain standards and become &amp;quot;weaker&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thing is, I would much rather live in the later society. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It makes people complacent and less likely to push themselves to learn new skills and persevere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This I must disagree with. According to this &lt;a href=""http://martinprosperity.org/media/GCI%20Report%20Sep%202011.pdf""&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, all four Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland) are consistently ranked among the top 10 nations in the world when it comes to Innovation, Technology, Talent, Research and &amp;quot;Creative class share&amp;quot; (whatever that is). Other countries with consistent top-10 placements in that list are the USA and Canada. That&amp;#39;s no fluke. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would argue that the last one is the one most likely to help them get a better job, but people are lazy because of the entitlement culture here in the US.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or they simply like their current job. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, all forms of higher education are free in Scandinavia, and you are actually given handouts for studying. This does not mean that everyone will become a physicist at CERN, it only means that everyone has an equal opportunity to it. And isn&amp;#39;t that what the American dream is supposed to be about? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;They truly believe that they deserve something for nothing. They think the world owes them something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They are paying it with their taxes, taxes they themselves have paid. It&amp;#39;s not something for nothing - it&amp;#39;s their hard work that lays the foundation for their social security.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The problem isn’t giving people money when they don’t work ... it’s taking it away when they do&amp;quot; - Andrew Coyne&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The wealthy get far more handouts than the poor. They support the system because it benefits them, not just out of the goodness of their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People who are on welfare are there for a reason. When someone has to fend for themselves and can&amp;#39;t, they don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;become stronger&amp;quot;, they become homeless.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;He worked hard because he knew there was no safety net for him. He supported a family of three with an income of 28K and now they live better than some Americans who earn twice that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Good for him, but some people also win the lottery. If he got hit by a car and couldn&amp;#39;t work for 10 years, what would have happened to him and his family?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would argue that the last one is the one most likely to help them get a better job, but people are lazy because of the entitlement culture here in the US.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Is it possible that there&amp;#39;s other reasons they don&amp;#39;t take it? Maybe they can&amp;#39;t afford to stop working, for example? (a common reason why people don&amp;#39;t study for a better job)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe that this mentality is caused by welfare programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I believe it&amp;#39;s caused by the American Dream, the great expectations of becoming successful just for being in america. It attracts entitled people who think just because they were lucky enough to have a career or start a business without meeting any obstacles, that they got there through &lt;em&gt;hard work&lt;/em&gt; and everyone else is just &lt;em&gt;lazy and entitled&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a somewhat different note, I also believe that corporate welfare is just as terrible, if not worse.

CMV: There's nothing wrong with using the pull-out method of birth control in a monogamous relationship.,"I was recently discussing birth control methods with a group of girlfriends, and one friend said she uses the pull-out/withdrawal method with her boyfriend. I, along with the other gals, instinctively gasped and said it was irresponsible, but she argued that it's fine.  Her reasons that the withdrawal method is responsible for her:  1) They're monogamous and have been for years, so there is no risk of STDs for them.  2) She's tried several other methods before and had various problems with all of them. She says this method is the best for her body and their pleasure.  3) They're adults (over 30), so he's well aware of how to predict his oncoming orgasm and the risk of not pulling out in time is slim to none.   4) She says the deal with ""precum"" possibly containing sperm only happens if he hasn't urinated since the last time he had an orgasm, so they always make sure he has urinated first to eliminate that issue.   5) The failure rates of withdrawal method are only a couple % points more than the failure rates of other non-hormonal methods like condoms.   She says they've been using this method for a few years now with no issue. It still just seems instinctively wrong to me, but she's won me over I guess because I can't see anything wrong with her reasons. Sure, it has a higher % chance of failing, but as long as she's aware of what that % chance is and is willing to take it - and she is -then I guess it makes sense. *Every* method has a % chance of failing and she says withdrawal only has something like a 2% higher failure rate than condoms, which really isn't much.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

They decide they want to try it, because some of their friends have tried it and they think they&amp;#39;re ready for it. So, they have sex for the first time and low and behold they aren&amp;#39;t exactly experts. One thing leads to another and eventually when they try the pull-out method they mess it up and now their innocent high school relationship just got a whole lot more serious.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Basically, if the two people in this relationship fully understand the consequences of this form of birth control going wrong and are experienced enough to prevent that from happening then I don&amp;#39;t see a huge issue, but that isn&amp;#39;t the case in every monogamous relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with bungee jumping or skydiving or skiing.

CMV: The vastness of space does not guarantee the existence of extraterrestrial life.,"So its often been said that with vastness of space, the huge number of planets in the universe, and the increasing recognition of Earth-like planets that there is almost certainly going to be life out there. Stephen Hawking has even made this point.  I agree with the line of reasoning that all these can only serve to push up the probability of life out there, but I don't think that they  necessarily guarantee it or even make it likely. The main problem I have is that we don't know (or at least I don't think we know) the probability any given planet can and **will** have life. Since we live on the only known example of a planet that supports life we might be over estimating this probability. What if the chances that any given planet, even an Earth-like one, were to have life on it is 1 in a trillion? We would see that there are 500 billion planets and think that it virtually guarantees extraterrestrial life but it would actually only be a 50/50 proposition.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you&amp;#39;re talking about the observable universe. If there are hundreds of billions of stars and planets in this galaxy, not counting moons or any other space bodies which could support life, at least a hundred billion galaxies... &lt;a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=100+billion+*+100+billion+*+%281+%2F+1+trillion%29""&gt;lets estimate here with these rough numbers&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;100 billion planets * 100 billion galaxies * ( 1 / 1 trillion chance of life) = 10 billion planets likely to have life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With any estimate, even for just the observable universe, the likelihood that there &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; any other life bearing planets is near zero. The question becomes &amp;quot;what is the probability that we will come in contact with one of these planets&amp;quot; and that&amp;#39;s the basis of the Fermi Paradox.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You also have to account for the fact that when you look out into space with a telescope, you&amp;#39;re looking back in time. You&amp;#39;re seeing light which has traveled for hundreds of thousands, and millions, and billions of lightyears just to reach us. The blackness of space which should be full of blinding light is the very edge of light and the birth of the universe. There are plenty of planets and stars and galaxies we do not know exist because from our perspective, from the light that is reaching us, they don&amp;#39;t yet exist.

Ergo the vastness of the universe has no inherent implication for the likelihood of life on other planets&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If I have that more or less right, then I agree with you. But we also have a very low data set of whether earth-like planets do or do not have life. No data set, actually. So the odds could be 1 in 100 Trillion, or they could be 4 in 5. So I ask: Given the possibility of virtually any odds, what are the odds that those odds are so astronomically low as to never occur twice in  1,000,000,000,000,000,000 instances (thats 1 billion billion, the number of estimated earth-like planets according to a study by &lt;a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/110/48/19273.abstract""&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible. But given that life already occurred once that we know of (earth) and that we have very little data on other planets, it seems much more likely than not to have occurred a 2nd time, if not millions of times. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also recommend checking out Wait But Why&amp;#39;s relevant discussion of the &lt;a href=""http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html""&gt;Fermi Paradox&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0

The Prime Directive from Star Trek is Stupid CMV,"The prime directive is Starfleet's General Order number 1. It has some variation from series to series but generally dictates that there can be no interference with the internal development of alien civilizations.  It is generally regarded as a moral philosophy used to guide star trek captains:  ""The Prime Directive is not just a set of rules. It is a philosophy, and a very correct one. History has proven again and again that whenever mankind interferes with a less developed civilization, no matter how well intentioned that interference may be, the results are invariably disastrous."" —Jean-Luc Picard, Symbiosis  So maybe there is hypothetical evidence that interfering with alien cultures is always detrimental from star trek history that the viewer never knows.  But as a moral philosophy and a practical method it seems stupid.    Here are the problems with it:  1)	It seems to be propagated by the naturalistic fallacy and bans playing God, which is pretty weird because everything else about star trek moral philosophy is centered on secular humanism.  2)	There is a disturbing application of Social Darwinism.  Only the fittest civilizations which can avoid their own destruction and can achieve technical wonders on their own are worthy of survival, or joining the federation  3)	It can easily be used as an excuse for inaction when there are tough decisions to make.  4)	The evidence we have in the real world generally indicates that technology is a good thing  5)	It limits what the general mission of the federation is, exploration of new life and civilizations.  ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Star Trek to justify Star Trek, think about Hugh and the outcome explored in the double-episode &amp;quot;Descent&amp;quot;: introducing a culturally radical idea into the Borg consciousness was devastating to them. (And makes you wonder if the writers had a big grin, saying &amp;quot;hah! We made you feel sorry for the bad guys!&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But you can also look at Earth&amp;#39;s non-fictional history to see what the writers were probably trying to make us think about. When radical new ideas and technologies are introduced into a culture in a hurry, the outcome is almost always bad because:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The receiving culture fractures into progressives and traditionalists, who promptly go to battle with each other. (&lt;em&gt;Edit:&lt;/em&gt; And Star Trek TNG&amp;#39;s writers explored this a bit in the episode &amp;quot;First Contact&amp;quot;, where Riker gets trapped in the hospital of an almost-warp civilization.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the progressives, without any cultural ramp-up, tend to view and comprehend the new ideas and technologies with inappropriately ancient vocabularies. A gun is a kind of super spear, medicine is a type of magic, the Teller-Ulam warhead is just a very big cannonball. Think of Sapir-Worf... er, I mean Whorf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditionalists, in reaction, reject the new ideas and begin to dye their culture with this extreme prejudice, so that they will oppose even &lt;em&gt;their own kind&lt;/em&gt; trying to develop the same things independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The European colonization of America, Africa and Australia are examples.

Trying to speed up Marx&amp;#39;s schedule for communist utopia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Prime Directive is, in a sense, a way of anthropomorphizing an entire culture and treating it as if it were a child&amp;#39;s brain. We&amp;#39;ve realized that there must be a path to adulthood that includes allowing the child to be themselves and figure certain things out on their own.

Natural rights do not exist. CMV,"Traditionally, the rights to Life, Liberty, and Property are ascribed as natural rights. I do not think they exist in nature, and are instead a product of social construct: Such rights exist because there is mutual agreement that they exist. As their existence is derived from social construct, social construct could revoke them.  To illustrate my view, I propose a thought experiment. Suppose you are the only Hyper-Intelligent Koala on your own island. You are incapable of leaving this island, however within it you have the ability to do whatever you please. Whether or not you have the right to do a given thing is meaningless: You are capable, and the only consequences will be natural consequences. If you move a rock at the base of the mountain, no one will become angry with you moving the rock. But if that movement triggers a landslide and you die as a result, that is a natural consequence of your actions.  In this scenario, rights are no different from ability. Therefore there is no such thing as a right in this context. Ergo, rights are dependent upon interactions between various entities. So now, let's consider what happens when another Hyper-Intelligent Koala comes to the island.   Prior to the arrival of the second koala, who I will call Chubby, your food supplies were scarce. There was only one Eucalyptus tree on the island, and it was regularly pecked bare by you. With Chubby's arrival, your ability to survive is now threatened. Either you will survive, Chubby will survive, or neither will survive.   Chubby's arrival on the island was not violent. His climbing into the eucalyptus tree was adorable, certainly not violent. His eating of a few leaves was not violent. But these innocent acts are what we could call ""theft."" But if this theft occurs in an effort to protect what I expect natural right proponents would argue is the most fundamental right: The right to live, how does that interact with the other rights? The right to property?  You would, under a natural right to property, be allowed to prevent Chubby's access to your eucalyptus tree. But in doing so, you would be violating Chubby's right to life: he cannot live without food. So in this situation, rights either are in direct conflict with one another, or simply do not exist. I posit that they do not exist.   Now, suppose Chubby has an idea. ""If you restrict your intake, and I restrict my intake, this tree will grow larger,"" he says. ""In fact, it will bear fruit and create new trees, providing enough food for both of us. Yes, we will go hungry for a time, but in the long run we will both survive and have an excess of food."" You propose that Chubby be responsible for harvesting the correct amount of leaves, and the two of you share them. Now, you have labor on your property in exchange for food. You enable chubby's ability to live, and expect in return he will not only perpetuate your ability to live, but will decrease your need for food by performing labor. You also expect that he will not murder you and take your tree for his own. At this point, you have mutual agreement: To respect eachother's right to live.   It is my view that this is the manner in which rights are derived. Change my view.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are correct, in a way. There are several different schools of thought on human rights and how they are derived. The &amp;quot;natural rights&amp;quot; are, if I remember correctly, a purely western idea which formed fairly recently. So a disagreement from that is not a wrong view and it doesn&amp;#39;t have to change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But going from your example I don&amp;#39;t think you are defining &amp;quot;rights&amp;quot; the right way. What you&amp;#39;re basically saying is that rights don&amp;#39;t exist at all, but rather we respect each other&amp;#39;s freedom and right to live because it benefits us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But having the concept of rights is convenient because in some cases people don&amp;#39;t provide any benefit to society or any other individual. Is it morally right to exlude this person from our social contract? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The idea of natural rights was derived from the concept of &amp;quot;human dignity.&amp;quot; Everyone that is human has human dignity and they all deserve to be treated the same way, with respect for their desires and freedoms. So if every human has human dignity, then naturally they have these rights that need to be protected. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So ultimately there&amp;#39;s nothing in nature that guarantees rights, but if you believe that all humans are special creatures who deserve a chance to live a good life, then you have to accept that naturally they have certain rights that allow them that chance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s obviously a concept that is created by humans for humans but it helps us form a better society. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural rights are not rights that exist in nature (because there are none), but rules that would be good for humans to recognize because of human nature. For example, humans could establish a rule of &amp;quot;you are entitled to kill 1 person a year&amp;quot;, but that would be a bad rule. The best possible rules produce what are called natural rights.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;You would, under a natural right to property, be allowed to prevent Chubby&amp;#39;s access to your eucalyptus tree. But in doing so, you would be violating Chubby&amp;#39;s right to life&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The right to life is more properly stated as the right to not be killed. It doesn&amp;#39;t mean that anyone is entitled to sustenance. With this correction, rights do not conflict in your example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: Police brutality/corruption has not increased, and isn't as big of an issue as it's being made out to be","There was never once a time where the police force as a whole has been perfect. There have always been the bad officers who abuse their powers and there always will be. As it's been said many times before, they're just human, prone to making mistakes.  With that being said, the percentage of active police officers who do abuse their powers has not changed by a significant amount. Back in, say, the 1970's, social media wasn't really around, and cameras weren't a common thing for people to carry around with them. So if a police officer was abusing their powers, they could get away with it much easier. Now that everybody is walking around with a camera and there are more surveillance devices around, police brutality is recording or caught more often. Then of course it's brought to the media, and with the impact that media influence has, is blown out of proportion and it makes it look like there are more police who abuse their powers than there actually are.  I don't actually have any concrete physical evidence that I provide a link to, since this view of mine I formed based entirely off of my own observances of how stuff goes, so I'm very open to changing my view.     _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"CMV: Too little is being done to save the environment, too late","Looking at the methane explosions in the arctic, Shell trying to go for the arctic oil, and the disconcerting oceanic reviews of recent months I have serious concerns that not enough is being done to save the environment.

I believe that anything short of mass-governmental actions may not be enough to avoid the complete reshaping of ecosystems in the next ~100 years.

If we stop all emissions tomorrow, the climate is still going to change. We would probably still lose all of Greenland&amp;#39;s ice by the end of the century. At this point we are trying to slow the rate of change so that we can buy more time for adaptation efforts and hopefully put the lid back on Pandora&amp;#39;s box.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I understand why this might make you feel awful. So let me give you two general themes that might make you a little more optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;The big players are coming around&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is beginning to realize the immediacy of its environmental catastrophe. The last year has seen &lt;a href=""http://cleantechnica.com/2014/08/26/chinas-coal-consumption-finally-decreased/""&gt;China&amp;#39;s use of coal shrink&lt;/a&gt;, which is remarkable given their past industrial expansion&amp;#39;s reliance on coal (the worst fossil fuel). This suggests that China is finally beginning to manage a policy that might reign in its carbon emissions. This would be a huge win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks are beginning count carbon into their long term evaluations of a companies profitability. HSBC in it&amp;#39;s predictions for several energy companies suggest that they &lt;a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/business/21577097-either-governments-are-not-serious-about-climate-change-or-fossil-fuel-firms-are""&gt;overvalued by up to 40%&lt;/a&gt; assuming that governments and industry move to reign in emissions within the next 10-20yrs (a la Copenhagen Accords). Environmental groups are one thing, but when banks are doing it something is going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental campaigns like &lt;a href=""http://gofossilfree.org/wrap-up/""&gt;Divest and Fossil Free are exploding&lt;/a&gt; in popularity across the world. Universities, charities, religious groups, and now even nations (Norway) are divesting. The resurgence of these campaigns may force national action in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Their might be a technical solution&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon capture is still relatively new but it could be tremendously important. It is currently quite energy intensive but with more groups looking into it there might be a break through. If this break through is effective at the PPM range, we might be able to start recovering CO2. And certain methods for recovering CO2 such as using it to produce CaCO3 can even fight the effects of climate change, with nations like &lt;a href=""http://www.eco-business.com/news/100-million-for-singapores-road-energy-efficiency/""&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; using the process to produce reinforcement for the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There might a be a crazy idea like shooting SO2 in the upper atmosphere to decrease the amount of solar radiation making it to earth.

Humans have been &amp;quot;completely reshaping&amp;quot; the environment for a while now.  Climate change is real, but it DOES NOT pose a catastrophic threat to either humanity or the vast majority of earth&amp;#39;s living species in the short term ( the next few hundred years.)  You do not know what technologies will arise that reduce emissions (think better forms of nuclear.)  You do not know what technologies will be able to reverse environmental destruction (think geoengineering.)  If all of humanity still used horses and buggies and burned firewood for heat the environmental damage would be much higher.  It takes  quite a leap of faith to assume humanity will suddenly STOP progressing in technology and suddenly STOP becoming more efficient after thousands of years of doing so.  Not to mention that global population is estimated to begin decreasing soon...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although your intentions are good, your priorities are morally perverse to the extreme.  All around the world people are clawing their way out of extreme poverty, starvation and misery.

You only have this absolute privilege because your forefathers already climbed out of national poverty - but you would deny  non-Westerners this right.  It&amp;#39;s downright imperialistic, its a moral calculus fit for Nazi&amp;#39;s ( who were very environmentally conscious by the way.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I say , we can start speculating about restricting the right of people to create goods and services in favor of fish not going instinct once there are less children starving to death each day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: In many airliner configurations, a portion of extra legroom seats should be reserved for tall people at no extra cost.","As a person of above average height, I often find I have trouble in many airliner configurations with the amount of space available. Many times, my legs end up pressed right up against the seat in front of me. This is uncomfortable for me, as it often hurts, forces me to arrange my legs in strange ways to actually be able to sit comfortably and often even prevents me from lowering the tray table fully. It is also uncomfortable for other people, as the person in front of me usually cannot recline their seat and has to deal with my knees in their back, and the persons next to me often have to put up with my feet in their footwell as they cannot fit anywhere else. It can also be dangerous; if I am wedged in a seat (as I often am) I am less able to move freely in case of evacuation and could also block other people in my row.  My height is not a disability, nor an abnormality. I am able to lead a completely normal life and have no difficulties or hindrances in almost any other walk of life. It is also something I have absolutely no control over and something that cannot be changed. As such, it is my view that where available on airliners, I should be able to access seats with extra legroom at no extra cost.  In many airlines, it is the case that one can purchase seats with extra legroom and no other change or increase in service. In these cases, I think tall people should be offered these seats without having to pay the extra charge. Of course, tall people can waive their right to these seats if they want to make sure they sit next to their travelling companions, but the offer should be made. I don't mind how airlines decide how to implement this; whether by visual inspection when you check in, requiring you to be measured (I wouldn't mind having my height measured to be able to fly in minimum comfort) when allocating seats, or any other method. However, I think that the desires of those who pay for extra leg room should not outweigh the need of tall people to fit in their seat and that as long as someone is over a certain height (which the airline could determine based on their knowledge of their seating arrangements) they should be offered a chance to sit somewhere with enough space for them without any extra cost.  At the very least, I think emergency (and even bulkhead) row seats should not be sold at an extra premium and should be reserved for tall people. If there are no tall (by the airlines definition) passengers, then they could be allocated to anyone who is lucky enough. If an airline wishes to make profit of extra leg room seats, they should install seats with extra leg room and should no be allowed to make their profit at the expense of people who literally cannot help how tall they are.

CMV: Business school is a perversion of the purpose of universities,"I can't consider business to be a legitimate academic discipline.

Simply put, I think business as an academic discipline is not worthy of respect and, while lucrative, isn't aimed at expanding knowledge.

One of the first professional areas that the brand-new German-style universities focused on were business: six of the biggest business schools were founded in this era. Treating administration, management, and entrepreneurship as scientific problems you could study, understand and teach were part of the broader approach to institutionalizing research.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, business school doesn&amp;#39;t develop critical thinking skills found in other disciplines, but rather cultivates a sense that the world exists of cutthroats and social Darwinism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eh, I don&amp;#39;t see the case studies they do in MBA programs as any more suspicious than the ones JD or MD students look at.

CMV: Freedom of speech is being taken too far,"In the last few weeks we've had two huge events happen in the world, both of which were caused by matters relating to ""freedom of speech."" The first being the hacking of Sony over The Interview, and today the shooting at the offices of a satirical magazine in Paris. I certainly value our free speech but to me there is a clear line between exercising your first amendment right (""President Obama sucks!"" etc) and doing things that are known to be offensive to other cultures (Satirical cartoons of prophets, assassinating leaders, etc).  Perhaps this is a bad analogy - but if you say something antagonizing to a bully and you get your ass kicked, you should have anticipated that outcome.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is a bad analogy - but if you say something antagonizing to a bully and you get your ass kicked, you should have anticipated that outcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the fundamental aspects of a civilized society is that we absolutely do not condone or accept vigilante violence.  As part of the social contract, the power to legitimately use violent force is held by the state alone, and the state has to act within the bounds of the law in using that force.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The incidents you describe are vigilantism of the worst kind.  Free speech will always include speech which offends, but causing offense isn&amp;#39;t a violation of the social contract.  Vigilante violence against people who offend you is.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Consider that the alternative to free speech is government violently suppressing speech.  In that case, not only do the bullies still get to use violence to suppress the speech which offends them, but now they don&amp;#39;t face the consequences of using violence in violation of the social contract.  That seems like a lose-lose to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is a bad analogy - but if you say something antagonizing to a bully and you get your ass kicked, you should have anticipated that outcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Think of something you do every day that you consider perfectly reasonable; something that harms nobody in any direct sense.  Let&amp;#39;s imagine this thing is to defined as &amp;quot;walking down the street wearing headphones&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now imagine that I tell you that you doing this offends me deeply for reasons of personal belief that you don&amp;#39;t share.  I warn you that continuing to do this will mean that I will shoot you on sight.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a society that can&amp;#39;t protect you from me, it might be &lt;em&gt;wise&lt;/em&gt; for you to take off your headphones to preserve your life.  That does not make my demand legitimate, does not make my shooting you an acceptable act and does not make my actions your fault.  What you ought to hope is that society will protect you from someone like me and make it clear to me that my preferences will not be especially entertained because I threaten violence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think people who satirize Muhammad in ways that Muslims consider blasphemous should stop doing that.  I think it&amp;#39;s counterproductive, antagonizing and in poor taste.   But if someone disagrees with me on that point, &lt;em&gt;they don&amp;#39;t deserve to be shot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I think being vegan/vegetarian for a cause doesn't make sense. CMV,"Nowadays, most vegans or vegetarians don't eat animal flesh or don't consume anything animal related in order to prevent harm and keep balance in nature. I usually see oversensitive statements regarding how much we should care about animals and how they suffer during food industrialization process. The thing that keeps bugging my head is that in a regular natural environment, the trophic chain is nothing but a true slaughter where the most adapted kill and eat the weaker ones (and I believe that being torn apart by a lion is worse than being slaughtered by a butcher). That being said, I believe there's no reason to bother about veganism since it's natural behaviour of every natural being. Change my view, fellow Redditors.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m interested in your conception of &amp;quot;natural.&amp;quot; If you&amp;#39;re implying that all that&amp;#39;s natural is good, I think you may have to reconsider. Think about diseases, which are quite prevalent in nature, that we have banished, or made less serious, with medicine, much of which is certainly not &amp;quot;natural.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is true that there is a food chain, clearly defined, that is very &amp;quot;natural.&amp;quot; However, one could argue that raising animals for food isn&amp;#39;t very natural, besides certain kinds of ants, human beings are the only species that do it. Once more, raising certain kinds of animals creates byproducts that are harmful to the environment (Cows, general shipping for meat and fish and such).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I am not a vegan, and I do consume meat. I can, however, see why many vegans would choose their lifestyle. Obviously, it means different things to different people and there&amp;#39;s variation, but it seems to me that the majority of vegans believe that by less people eating meat, there will be less harm to environment. This does seem, at least to me, to be a good reason to be a vegan. There are, of course, other ways, such as buying local and others, which are also perfectly viable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, while I am not advocating for everybody to become vegans, I can see why people choose the lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have the ability to change the way they relate to and interact with other species. Unlike, for example, a lion, I have the luxury as a human to be introspective about how I treat the food I will be eating. I know that there are things that I value: health, safety, lack of stress, freedom from unnecessary suffering. Because of my empathy, I am also able to realize that humans and non-human animals have (or seem) to have these values as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I then have a choice I can make: either respect these values in other beings because it feels like the right thing to do, or find some way to justify ignoring these values in other beings. Obviously, this argument only holds if you accept that non-human animals have the capacity to suffer and have an aversion to suffering, and if you have a desire to lessen unnecessary suffering even if it takes a little effort. If neither of these are true for you, then you will not have any reason to treat animals any differently, but hopefully this offers a little bit of reasoning why we might treat our food better than the rest of the animal kingdom, even if that contravenes the &amp;quot;natural order of things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: I see no reason why men's and women's chess are separate events.,"Sure, sex segregation makes a lot of sense for many sports/games where men might have an advantage due to physiological differences.  But chess is purely mental. There is no need for strength, speed, endurance or any other physiological parameter that would give men an advantage.  In fact, some women do compete successfully in top flight tournaments with men, something that would be impossible in physical sports.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judit_Polg%C3%A1r  If anything, it seems that ""women only"" chess events are sexist, because the implication is that women are not as smart as men.  Edit:  The totality of several posts convinced me that women only events maybe needed *for now* as a kind of a remedial measure for countering many years of men dominance in chess and the fact that currently women are underrepresented in chess.  However, I still believe that an *eventual* goal should be complete sex equality in chess tournaments.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eventual goal should be completely mixed tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, I want to take a tack that no one else took. It&amp;#39;s not about capability necessarily, it&amp;#39;s about the environment of the tournaments and clubs. There is a significant amount of sexism towards female chess players when they play in male dominated areas. It can be incredibly discouraging and it puts many women off playing chess at any sort of competitive level. It goes beyond just being discouraging- it&amp;#39;s threatening and frankly incredibly scary to be talked to that way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Check out this &lt;a href=""http://fanoudraws.tumblr.com/post/68091072768/sorry-this-post-is-so-long-open-images-in-new""&gt;commentary comic&lt;/a&gt; from a female player to maybe get some insight on why many women stop playing, never start playing, or stick to women&amp;#39;s only groups. (Here is the &lt;a href=""http://fanoudraws.tumblr.com/private/68215307724/tumblr_mwwdpz6m5i1r8ptfc""&gt;transcript&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;#39;re having difficulty reading the images.) It&amp;#39;s not just the play itself. It&amp;#39;s the environment and the people who participate in it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will probably get buried, but I suspect that a lot of people replying in this thread just don&amp;#39;t know any female chess players at all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The most important reason has nothing to do with intelligence, skill, sexism, or anything of the sort.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you ask any female professional chess player why they like to participate in female-only events, the number one answer they will always give you is &amp;quot;networking with other female chess players.&amp;quot;  And there is an extremely practical reason why this is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The professional chess circuit is quite grueling competition-wise, but it&amp;#39;s also really tough on your wallet. In addition to tournament entry fees, most players also need to pay for a flight and hotel for EVERY TOURNAMENT. The hotel is often the most expensive component, and female players are particularly hard hit because they have tremendous difficulty finding female roommates to share hotel rooms with to lower costs (there simply are not that many women who attend), and sharing rooms with male chess players is not an option in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ask any high-level female player and they will tell you the same thing: chess tourneys are often only made affordable by sharing hotels with other women, and often these are women that female players have met at women&amp;#39;s chess tournaments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: I believe that regularly browsing 4chan will make you into a worse person,"Because of the anonymity on 4chan people are more prone to not think through, care about what they post and are quicker to throw out insults. They will care about how people respond to them, but since it's largely negative they will stoop down to the same level rather than go to any high ground since they are not linked to an identity.  Surrounding the entire site there's a general pessimistic group mentality, and people are subconsciously encouraged to take part of it in order to feel like they are a part of the group. Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate, women, SJWs, casual gamers, Jews, and any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups.  On boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof. Things about e-celebrities will start as rumors, ideas about them or things will get taken out of context and it will be posted continually until it's taken as fact. It will reach conspiracy theory levels of ""proof"" where people will simply believe it because they feel as if they are a part of a group-effort that's uncovering something.  Surrounding yourself with this will in general make you into a more pessimistic, negative and possibly depressive person.  I'm not saying that every person who browses 4chan is depressed or negative, but that the majority of them are affected negatively by browsing the site.  Thinking that you are unaffected by this doesn't necessarily mean you are, but instead means that you are unaware of how much it affects you.

It&amp;#39;s also a product of individual stupidity, if your believing something random people are telling you without it being backed by proof and your own individual research, well that&amp;#39;s your own gullibility.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for 4chan making people into a worse person, I would strong disagree.  I&amp;#39;d say more it just lets people be free, free to test the waters and do whatever without your idea&amp;#39;s, jokes, concepts tied to any identity.  Every thought stands of its own individual merits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been around 4chan since 2004 and the only way I would ever describe it would be &lt;em&gt;chaotic neutral&lt;/em&gt;.

So why would a bunch of social outcasts who get made fun of encourage hate and let such raw emotion reign supreme?  Quite honestly it dilutes it.  Getting called a &lt;em&gt;faggot&lt;/em&gt; on 4chan constantly helps you to brush it off when you hear it on the street, and the nice thing about the anonymity of the 4chan board is essentially you have a new identity with each post letting you brush it off even more.  That last post you made someone made fun of you, well cool no one knows that the person who just made the post people are laughing at was the same post they were making fun of.  You&amp;#39;re no longer the &lt;em&gt;faggot&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;re the &lt;em&gt;comedian&lt;/em&gt; until you make a new post and you&amp;#39;re the &lt;em&gt;troll&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4chan style sites don&amp;#39;t create pessimistic, negative, and depressed people it just attracts them and quite honestly it&amp;#39;s nice to be able to show raw emotion and not have it permanently tied to your identity.  You never have to worry about people being like &amp;quot;oh that dude, that dude always has problems -ignored-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve used 4chan a bunch of times to let out my problems about being depressed, suicidal and raped.  It&amp;#39;s wonderful because I can let it all out and continue to be a member of that community without the community permanently tying what happened to me to my identity. If I fully discussed my rape irl i was always going to feel broken because everyone I talked to would then associate it with my identity and it would be something I would never escape.  Even on reddit i was originally hesitant to be open about it because of the username system would tie it to my reddit identity.  But on 4chan I could discuss it all i wanted and it was a massive emotional relief.  In real life you don&amp;#39;t know if your emotional troubles are going to annoy or be a burden to whoever is kind enough to listen, you don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re just being kind and don&amp;#39;t truly care, but on 4chan style board, if no one cares they&amp;#39;re not going to respond and if they feel your problems are stupid they grant you the right to start over immediately and don&amp;#39;t force anyone to carry their past with them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the mindset i got from 4chan that helps me and others move on from our problems, that we shouldn&amp;#39;t drag them around to each &lt;em&gt;new thing&lt;/em&gt; we do but instead move on and start over.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s this aspect that attracts the people you describe, the site however doesn&amp;#39;t create these people it merely attracts them and for many like myself, helps them get out of that mindset in their real life. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been browsing that site for 10 years, and arguably i&amp;#39;m more optimistic and positive because i&amp;#39;ve been exposed to that raw humanity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I wrote all of this in all honesty not thinking anything would change your view based on your last sentence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thinking that you are unaffected by this doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean you are, but instead means that you are unaware of how much it affects you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As it seems you hold the belief that even if people like myself don&amp;#39;t feel they are being effected by this site negatively, you are insisting they are and are just ignorant to their own emotions and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit&lt;/strong&gt;: my terrible grammar&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;4chan has certainly desensitized me through the years, but has shown me another side of the human psyche. This side is normally censored and hidden away. 4chan reminds me of how the Internet was (to me) in the 90&amp;#39;s. It was a place of complete and total anonymity and we were happy with it that way. If we wanted to put ourselves out there, we could but we weren&amp;#39;t encouraged to do so as a societal norm. If we offended the wrong person, we&amp;#39;d get hacked but not our entire lives potentially ruined while people laughed about it! &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;About pessimism and what not, the world isn&amp;#39;t a friendly place. You&amp;#39;re only going to take in what you choose to expose yourself to. If you only exposed yourself to /b/ or /pol/, you will be affected. At the same time, if you only viewed &lt;a href=""/r/spacedicks/""&gt;/r/spacedicks/&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""/r/wtf/""&gt;/r/wtf/&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;#39;re probably going to be affected in some way as well. There&amp;#39;s a happy medium to be made that exists. I use the chans as often as reddit. They both are have excellent parts plus really shitty parts. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To un-ironically call 4chan an echo chamber while on reddit is the most absurd thing I&amp;#39;ve read for quite some time. Reddit has always been a big hugbox for pseudo-intellectualism, sophomoric &amp;quot;me too&amp;quot; inside joke threads that go on forever, and feel-good emotional bullshit. 4chan, there&amp;#39;s no upvotes. There&amp;#39;s a lot of noise on 4chan, but you can navigate past it and find some excellent content. See a thread you want to comment on, go in and drop a bomb. Leave if you want, if you don&amp;#39;t, keep hitting F5. You can ignore someone, sure, but their comment will be right up top where yours is chronologically on any of the chans.  If someone hurts your feelings, either pick it apart or ignore it. It is really like hard to just piss off? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If I see a big news story break, I am going to hear about it on 4chan before reddit 99.9% of the time. Why? Reddit has a bunch of dickheads trying to start a thread from the same link (all racing for karma) and then the thread will have to gain enough momentum to appear on the front page so unless I&amp;#39;m in the /new/ wasteland, I am behind the curve. 4chan may have it posted multiple times within seconds/minutes as well, but the one with the most enticing headline and immediate comments will always appear on the front page (or at least in the catalog) and the successful thread is the one used to near capacity, then redirected to the next big thread all the while without karma whores pushing eachother for control...the would-be karma whores are simply wasting their time trying to use a thread that&amp;#39;s not as popular about a same topic. So while I&amp;#39;ve already discussed the news of the day on 4chan, I can discuss the news of yesterday on reddit. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think that people that openly hunt down those they don&amp;#39;t agree with online IRL are the reason people use 4chan and other anonymous forums. After a night of drinking even on reddit, I check my comments and prune them accordingly even though I only have a handful of friends that know who I really am. I don&amp;#39;t want any of these fascist politically correct fuckbags bothering me IRL. In fact, to think that people like this even exist make me a bit nauseous. SJWs. women, Jews, blacks, etc are protected classes as it is politically incorrect to attack them, the winners of the war write the history, the educators revise the history etc etc. If someone is an asshole and &amp;quot;triggers&amp;quot; someone into doing something, it&amp;#39;s sad, but the &amp;quot;triggered&amp;quot; still makes their own choice. We are not robots. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People trying to, at the very least, change freedom of speech into something else are weak and pathetic human beings. When sites like 4chan are banned from the Internet one day it will be a very sad day. Those seeking real ID programs and the like are technocratic fascists and no, I don&amp;#39;t give a shit about their feelings because they don&amp;#39;t give a shit about mine! In fact, those hoping for an Internet with real IDs, I hope people come after them with pitchforks!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
I believe allowing unrelated topics to be part of the same bill is damaging to the legislative process. CMV,"It is a common practice in the introduction of legeslation to include completely unrelated issues in an attempt to get them passed as part of the main issue. For example, one party might want to pass law A, but not law B. A second party wants to pass lab B, but not law A. So when the first part introduces a bill on law A the second party will tack on law B in hopes that the first wants law A to pass so badly that they'll be willing to allow law B to slip through. A recent example was anti abortion legislation being grouped in with motorcycle safety laws.  I find this disruptive to the process. By forcing politicians to weigh the merits of completely unrelated issues against each other, the consideration given to individual issues is diluted and good laws get shot down to avoid the passing of bad, or vise versa. Change My View.   **EDIT:** My view has been changed. Thanks to /u/thedeeno for pointing out that this is how minority interests get their views noticed and pushed through despite little interest. Also to /u/floorberry for pointing out that this is a way to get around using a LOT of time on small and (to the greater body) unimportant topics such as relatively small allocations for infrastructure upkeep. /u/treseritops made a similar point very well. Also, thanks to /u/auandi for pointing out that the House *already* has a rule against this, but it's effectively castrated by the normal political structure. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The allowance of amendments isn&amp;#39;t the problem in the US political system.  Amendments play a valuable role in legislation, and they can improve many laws.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem is that the politicians involved choose to include unrelated things and their peers don&amp;#39;t vote that shit down as stupid and unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Congress doesn&amp;#39;t need to pass bills that are hundreds of pages long that none of the reps have read before they vote.  They don&amp;#39;t need to accept amendments that aren&amp;#39;t germane to the issue.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They are making a choice to validate this behavior and to make laws in this way.  It&amp;#39;s not the fault of the process.  It&amp;#39;s the fault of the people involved in it, and it&amp;#39;s the fault of voters for putting up with that shit for years and years.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s actually beneficial: This is how minority interests get things done.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ignoring the practical problems that arise when we start creating arbitrary issue boundaries, a system where every issue is segmented would be a system dominated by majority interests and also a system where negotiating is severely limited.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For instance, suppose a few states live in a particularly dry region of the country. These states might have a minority interest in, say, fresh water delivery systems. Suppose they need to build a new one. Answer this for yourself: Why would the majority fund a project like this?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Because they are generous?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Because it&amp;#39;s the right thing to do?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Because they can get something in exchange?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By allowing &amp;#39;unrelated&amp;#39; issues into bills, we give this minority interest leverage at the negotiating table. They can effectively say: we can&amp;#39;t support your bill unless we get traction on our issue as well. In addition, by giving them a stake at the table, we can make our bill, which may otherwise be irrelevant to the minority, something worth taking action on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now this does NOT mean dry-state representatives can SAFELY vote NO on a bill when they don&amp;#39;t get traction on their issue. A vote is a constantly evolving negotiation, where the public perception, public desire, majority interest, and minority interest are constantly balancing. Allowing bills to be open documents maximizes the issues that get weighed into this calculation. I think this is a good thing - even though is may be frustrating when your issue is blocked by some other interest. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tldnr;&lt;/strong&gt; unrelated topics increase the leverage of minority interests and makes the original bill appealing to more counter parties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: Cold pizza is a tragedy and people who claim it is as good, or better hot pizza have poor taste.","When I was in high school, I started my love affair with pizza early by mastering the peel and poker at the local ""Papa _____"" joint.  In college, it was practically currency.  In my mid 20's I began to appreciate different kinds of flour, the many methods of cooking it.  I love me some pizza.    When I hear somebody willing to forego the few seconds it would take to even just microwave it slightly (or few minutes in a toaster oven), I actually wonder why this person is putting such terribly unhealthy food into their body while getting such little enjoyment from it.  Here is my logic for arriving at my contention:  * The temperature of **any** food or beverage has significant impact on its flavor, texture, aroma, and overall quality.  There is a reason why fine wines and champagne have ideal serving temperatures. * Pizza contains many oils, mostly from cheese, that are more present and aromatic when warm.   * The texture is significantly better when warm - the crust is flakier but still soft, the cheese is melted and more flavorful. * It was cooked and meant to be consumed hot, immediately. I don't know of any chef or restaurant that takes it from the oven to the cooler for it to reach it's optimal quality before serving. * Therefore, warm/hot pizza will always be better than cold pizza, and spending even 45 seconds in a microwave will make the enjoyment increase several orders in magnitude. * If you disagree with this, I posit you a) are lazy b) have poor taste in pizza c) have great taste in quiche d) all of the above.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Since this smell offends my nose so much and makes me lose my appetite to a significant degree, I think cold pizza is actually more enjoyable in some cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: Deliberately increasing your caloric intake to add muscle (""bulking"") leads to obesity later in life.","The idea is that deliberately overeating will build eating habits that will be difficult to change later, when you are working a desk job and being a dad and not burning off those calories. This would not apply to celebrities whose job includes shaping their bodies and people with sufficient self-control that they are never tempted to keep eating the slab of ribs until they're gone. But it happens to former football players all the time.  One premise I have that you might not share is that losing weight is just about impossible once you have gained it. There is no scientifically approved diet that you can follow and it will work. This is why any weight gain that disrupts a body with a nice, working non-obese equilibrium is very risky.  In sum: like tanning, bulking is something that increases your relative status but is bad for your body in the long run. CMV. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"CMV: When I see a Corvette (or similar) with a handicap license plate, parked in a handicapped spot, these words invariably cross my mind: If you regularly get in and out of a vehicle with bucket seats 6"" off the ground, you're not handicapped.","I am fully sympathetic to those with disabilities, and of course they have every right to own whatever vehicle makes them happy. I'm particularly referring to cars I see regularly, at work for instance--if you drive a vehicle every single day that requires no insignificant amount of physical capability to crawl in and out of, you posess the physical capability to walk from the parking lot at large with the rest of us. This leaves those spaces open for those who really need them.   This isn't a rant, I'm truly open to having my mind changed here. I'm hoping there's something I'm missing!

"As disappointed as I am with current US government, its crime against humanity is nowhere near what Japanese did during WW2. CMV","Some people on Reddit think an American (who they thought I was one of), has no moral upperhand to criticize what Imperial Japan did to Koreans and Chineses, because of Guantanamo Bay and drone attacks (something about how Americans elected the representatives who support both of these things)                 I think their implication is that Guantanamo Bay and drone attack are on the same level of crime against humanity as atrocious act of Imperial Japanese Army.           If a Nazi sympathizer condemns what Imperial Japan did, then he/she has no moral upperhand.                  So, please change my view                  P.S. I'm not supporting neither GetMo or current use of drone attacks.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: reading comprehension fail. Leaving the original paragraph up for posterity&amp;#39;s sake. &lt;del&gt;Well, your first problem is you&amp;#39;re implying that the US gov&amp;#39;t are Nazi sympathizers, which are heavy buzzwords intended to stop arguments against your views in their tracks. So either you&amp;#39;re trolling or you&amp;#39;re looking for affirmation instead of opposing views.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Comparing one country&amp;#39;s war-time actions to another&amp;#39;s will never get you very far, whether you&amp;#39;re in favor or against the actions in question. In this particular case, I&amp;#39;m going to argue that because America isn&amp;#39;t currently involved in a large scale war, specifically as an aggressor, the two are completely incomparable and so can&amp;#39;t really be argued for or against. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure there ever was a war or event in American history that had enough similarities to Japan&amp;#39;s war, you&amp;#39;d have to ask that over at r/askhistorians (edit: while I make note of similarities regarding their wars against Vietnam and Korea, I make this particular comment because the Japanese war was a war of conquest not intended to remove a particular style of government that they felt threatened international stability. I don&amp;#39;t know a period in American history that is as concretely about conquest as the Japan-China war). The thing is, if we&amp;#39;re talking about an American&amp;#39;s ability to claim moral superiority in reference to the actions of the Japanese during their war with China et al, using the whole of American history instead of focusing purely on guantanamo and drone attacks, then no they do not have the moral upperhand (both in each country&amp;#39;s treatment of the opposition as well as treatment of their own citizens), especially taking into account their direct reactions to the Japanese during WWII. I would go so far as to say that both countries, one after the other, commited similar atrocities in the same regions only years apart from each other. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With regards specifically to American usage of drone attacks and guantanamo bay, though, I don&amp;#39;t see how you can compare the two at all. The circumstances are ridiculously different, the direct and indirect damage done in either scenario is leagues apart, and the purposes and consequences are wholly unrelated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: I agree that it&amp;#39;s silly to think Americans have no moral high ground when comparing specifically gitmo and drone attacks to the Japan-China war, but it is equally silly to think that Americans have a moral high ground at all when comparing their wartime history to Japan&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well... America has been toppling governments and engaging in quasi-imperialistic wars since Japan was a baby. Other commenters have listed many good examples so I&amp;#39;m not going to repeat them. To make the discussion even fairer - because why limit the comparison to only one country? - the European empires were as bad and sometimes worse than Japan, for much longer. From essentially genociding all of North America to turning the entire Congo into a brutal slave labour camp to fighting a war with China just so they could get the whole country addicted to opium. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When we hear about these atrocities we generally think something like &amp;quot;that was terrible, but it was a long time ago, and things were different.&amp;quot; Or even if we don&amp;#39;t rationalize it so; the genocide of Native American tribes and theft of their land doesn&amp;#39;t carry the same emotional weight as Japan&amp;#39;s invasion of China, or Operation Barbarossa. And the enslavement and brutal treatment of the Congolese by Belgium, while shocking, doesn&amp;#39;t start discussions about whether or not America has moral high ground over Belgium. When is the last time someone got pissy at Britain on reddit for the Mau Mau uprising?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We keep stirring up controversy and talking about how terrible Japan was for lots of possible reasons. Here are some guesses:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Their atrocities are more recent (though in the big picture, not really that much more recent at all)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They lost the war, while the West&amp;#39;s atrocities were usually roaring successes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;They aren&amp;#39;t white, and it bugs us more when non-white people do bad things than when white people do&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My opinion is that Japan was, for no more than 50 years and really only like 10 of those, a bit worse than the West was on average for the previous ~300 years. And so no, America has no high ground whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
I believe that you should be allowed to drive at whatever speed you wish as long as you aren't driving recklessly or under extenuating circumstances CMV,"I think that if you feel comfortable driving 80 mph or 40 mph you should be allowed to do so, as long as you aren't in a school or work zone, etc. because there are a lot more risks in those areas. I think when you're comfortable driving you will be a better driver, and if you aren't worrying about the speed limit or cops you are going to be more comfortable.   However, I think that you should only be allowed to drive at whatever speed you wish as long as you aren't driving recklessly. If you're weaving in and out of traffic at 90, you probably shouldn't be allowed to go 90, but if you just stay in the fast lane and pass the occasional person I don't think there is a problem.

You&amp;#39;re either going over 50 mph or you&amp;#39;re not.  With a holistic measurement of &amp;#39;reckless,&amp;#39; we get inconsistent enforcement, using ad hoc measurements by law enforcement officials to pull you over.  This is particularly problematic because getting pulled over can be the first step to a search and/or seizure depending on the circumstances.  Point being that you&amp;#39;re at greater risk of inquiry by virtue of getting pulled over than not, and a speed limit reigns in police discretion in at least one area.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Moreover, without some standard of recklessness, we won&amp;#39;t find out until something reckless has occurred that it was necessarily so.  I, for one, don&amp;#39;t want to look at a situation and say &amp;quot;Well, that was probably reckless&amp;quot; after someone has already been hurt or killed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So then we need to define the parameters of recklessness.  Weaving?  Okay.  But that&amp;#39;s already covered by other traffic laws, so it&amp;#39;s not pertinent to speed.  What&amp;#39;s a reckless speed?  Going too slow on the highway?  Going too fast in a school zone?  What is &amp;#39;too slow&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;too fast&amp;#39;?  25 mph?  55 mph in a school zone?  The more we try to define the contours of reckless speed, the closer we get to a bright line rule, anyway, out of sheer necessity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would argue that unless everyone is moving at a relatively uniform speed, you&amp;#39;re going to be encouraging traffic accidents. Regardless of what you, personally, consider to be reckless, there are going to be people who consider whatever speed you think is appropriate to be painfully slow, and people who consider it to be recklessly fast. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Speed limits aren&amp;#39;t arbitrary, mostly. They take into account traffic volume, road shape, the possibility of people merging... Even though it sometimes doesn&amp;#39;t seem like it, the roads are a complex system that must be managed as such; letting everyone do what they want is only inviting accidents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"One should never expect people to use invented pronouns (xe, xir, etc.) CMV","I see people on the Internet often argue that people are ""misgendering"" them by not using their special pronouns that they've invented.

The thing is, English has a gender neutral pronoun. ""They"". And it's not just a plural pronoun. It's been in the English language for hundreds of years referring to a singular person.   Pronouns are not something to just make up. They're for other people to identify you when you aren't there. You have something you can choose. It's called a name. You can have as crazy of a name or a nickname as you want, but making up crazy pronouns is off limits.   tl;dr: I will happily call someone by their preferred pronouns so long as they aren't a stupid made up pronoun.

"CMV: Women are inherently repulsed by gentle ""nice guys"" and are attracted mostly to ""alpha"" qualities","NOTE: those is not the stereotypical whiny ""I'm a nice guy why don't girls like me"" post. I used to be one of those guys but I am not anymore. But I WANT to be that nice guy.  I (19m) was raised thinking that I would find a nice girl who I could spend the rest of my life with. Someone who I could just love for who they are as a person (and vice versa) and that no matter what happened we would always stick together. However recently I've given up on this.  My entire life I was the stereotypical ""nice guy"" who always cared about the feelings of others, so much so that I would invite kids sitting alone at lunch to my table, I would hang out with my friends if they seemed like they needed someone to talk to, etc.   My mom instilled in me from a very young age that above all I should respect women and that was the way to find love. Hold the door open for her, be polite and courteous,buy her flowers, etc. Anyways, last year I met what seemed like the perfect girl. Beautiful, funny, ditzy, intelligent, basically everything I could ever want in a girl. Back then I believed there was a distinction between party rats and nice girls, and she seemed to embody essentially everything about the ""nice girl"". Well we made plans to hang out one night and she flaked on me. Then I found out the reason that she flaked: to fuck the football teams 5th string running back who was known around campus as a player and had fucked like 10 girls already (first 2 months of college). I stopped talking to her after that. As soon as she found a ""better option"" she just left me in the dust and never showed any regret for ditching me.  The point I'm trying to make is this: most girls I have met in college have behaved this way. Even the ones I would never expect it from, and the ones who said they ""weren't that girl"" and ""wanted a nice guy"". I used to laugh at nice guys on the internet but now I really feel for them. I'm not ugly by any means and I've had a little success but it was only when I pretended to be someone who I'm not and basically acted like the girl didn't exist until the night we hooked up. I HATE acting like this but based on my experiences it seems like the only way. Do women really hope to find a nice guy? Because I'm calling bullshit. Change my view.

And they were at a stage of life where it&amp;#39;s considered the best time to get out and have fun and experiment and not get tied down, so you&amp;#39;ll have higher odds of running into &amp;quot;flakes&amp;quot; who don&amp;#39;t really care about ditching you for whatever better comes along.  These demographics may change as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t speak for all women, but when I was still single, what frightened me was not feeling like I could &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; men.  Feeling like even someone who seems nice could just be doing anything to get some sex, and that once that happened they wouldn&amp;#39;t care anymore, and if it never happened cause I was onto that bullshit, they&amp;#39;d be all offended because &amp;quot;oh, you don&amp;#39;t like nice guys after all, then?!&amp;quot;  So what I wanted wasn&amp;#39;t a matter of surface behavior that seemed &amp;quot;nice guy&amp;quot; vs. &amp;quot;alpha&amp;quot;, it was a matter of finding someone I could trust.  Someone who felt genuine, someone that I not only wanted to be with, but I could trust that they actually had just as much interest in me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If someone sleeps with you only because you act cold and she wants the attention and validation, she has problems.  Find yourself someone with less problems if you still want that to chase that &amp;quot;loves you as a person&amp;quot; ideal.  And in the meantime, if you just want some sex, own up to that and learn how to be more honest about your intentions.  Reading the Savage Love advice column is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there are usually much more factors at play that all get grouped in a &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot; or jerk/pary person&amp;quot; category.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I can tell you why I wouldn&amp;#39;t be attracted to you at that point, that has nothing to do with niceness and whereas I am pretty repulsed by &amp;quot;alpha&amp;quot; qualities (I don&amp;#39;t like dominant men, arrogant men etc.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Being nice just means that, being nice. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But things that you and many others describe as nice have nothing to do with niceness. For instance, this desire for spending your life with someone. Wow, that&amp;#39;s a huge burden to look for from relationships you have when you are 19 or even later. I mean, if we fall in love that&amp;#39;s great, but can we just enjoy the moment without the pressure of what this is supposed to be?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think guys are told that girls need emotional connection and something serious. I know men who tried to &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; girls by telling them they love them even when the girls in question told them directly they can&amp;#39;t possibly love them yet, they don&amp;#39;t need to hear that shit, and they are fine with just hanging out. But many men think that a good girl just looks for someone to marry.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Look if I am 19 I am looking for a friend, someone I am attracted to and connect with. Not wanting to overly commit before i even know the person I am committing to on a truly deep level (plus the fact that we are only just shaping our lives and changing ourselves) doesn&amp;#39;t make me an anti intellectual party slut, it makes me just a little more realistic than you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem with guys like this is that they develop expectations of emotions before the person. They don&amp;#39;t compliment me by being ready to get serious, they just want to get serious and I fit the mold. They are often very superfeicial, see that you are smart and pretty and already they are deeply in love - yeah, right. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I can flirt with guys i see no future with and want none, exactly because of that. They are safe, I won&amp;#39;t disappoint them. I don&amp;#39;t have to care about their feelings. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But there are guys who are just like me, and who are nice. They are nice, but they aren&amp;#39;t trying to force closeness or a relationship, they need to get to know me first. We can be relaxed around each other. Those are usually the ones that get the most, not the alphas or the &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot; guys. Just guys you can identify with. Who go in without great promises or expectations, and create them based on you and what you have together. We know that if something happenes and we have to end it in few months or years, no one will say &amp;quot;what a waste it was&amp;quot; but we will look back at our time together as something really great for what it was, not for the preconcieved expectation it failed to fulfil. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And being overly curteous - that is nice, but that is nice in such a cold, formal way. It is a formality and when you want to bond with someone you want closeness. Sincerity. Identification. Gestures are just gestures. Of course you should be nice to the girl, and she should be nice to you, but there is no need for flowers and ceremonial behavior. Be nice in a personal way when you get to know her. Small thing every now and then when you get really inspired. Why appreciate the behavior you do so mechanically because you think you should? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A guy and a girl can make out together on a park bench and drink cheap beer and burp around each other and still be the sweetest people to one another and have the best date ever. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your problem isn&amp;#39;t that girls want some alpha type, it is that your idea of niceness is too impersonal, too formal and lacks some true substance. It&amp;#39;s ok you&amp;#39;re 19. There is a lot to learn about relationships and connecting to people. I suggest stop focusing on finding someone to spend your life with and start focusing on the actual person in front of you and what you have in the moment. Enjoy those moments and learn about people, you don&amp;#39;t need to fit it all into some grand plan and girls are no special creatures who are disrespected unless you&amp;#39;re ready to marry them right away. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: Only criminals should be worried about government snooping,"I don't believe that regular citizens have anything to worry about. It would be logistically impossible for any government officials to scrawl through your history and know everything about each citizen; they just have this information at hand in case they need catch a criminal.  Even as a self proclaimed ""liberal"" I don't see where the issue is. This information is going to be collected anyway, logged by every website you visit or telephone provider. I'd rather let the government have access to it in the chances that they can stop a crime. I know it's not the best way of crime fighting but even stopping one crime is better than nothing.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

That mentality is very much troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think one worrying aspect is that it&amp;#39;s been done on dubious legal backgrounds and as courts like the European Court of Justice I think it was recently came out with legislation against it. So the British government has brought out an emergency backdated law to cover their backs. The whole issue of whether we can trust the government to act legally in the first place should be addressed. Bear in mind we&amp;#39;ve just been informed that there may have been some paedophilia ring being kept under wraps by the government of the 70&amp;#39;s. If they are the kind of people you want to trust with your every phone call,  email and text message then I feel like your trust is misplaced. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t live in this rosy world where our politicians and civil servants are virtuous and perfect. Giving them so much power is a huge risk, like another poster said it&amp;#39;s naive to believe the population will regulate the government. The fact both main parties rushed this latest bill in means that whatever programme they have running of data collection is more important than party politics or individual MP&amp;#39;s opinions. By this measure the public has zero control over the policy because whoever they vote for are being pressured into keeping this data collection project running at all costs. Which suggests even further that the politicians may have little influence over the decision. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other reasons are that we have to trust every employee 100% who has access or comes into contact with this data. People send passwords, sensitive data and all sorts over email. It&amp;#39;s not a clever idea but the principle behind email is that it&amp;#39;s a private message between yourself and someone else. If this database is hacked or leaked then the fallout would be absolutely disastrous. If the whistle blowers like Snowden can leak the details of the operation to the public, who&amp;#39;s to say other people are leaking the actual data to foreign countries, or criminal organisations. The point is, this data should not be stored in the first place for such a thing to ever happen. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, there&amp;#39;s just no need for it. Intelligence services should have a good idea of who the potential criminals/terrorists are. It&amp;#39;s their job, sometimes somebody out of the blue will go out and commit crimes or commit an act of terrorism. But I&amp;#39;ve seen zero evidence that mass data suvellience has ever stopped that occurring. It would be far more cheap and efficient and less invasive to target priorities directly given reasonable assumption they were involved in criminal activities or plots. If this system was actually effective at doing what it claims to be doing then surely organised crime would be dropping to minuscule levels? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally where does it end? IoT is the next big thing, smart fridges that can inform you that you&amp;#39;re low on milk and even order it for you automatically is the future. We&amp;#39;ll have hundreds of smart internet connected devices in our homes. Is the government to have access to all of this? It&amp;#39;s fine I&amp;#39;ve done nothing wrong, go ahead record my every move inside my own house. I believe that recording the public is fine, because nobody expects that space to be private and nobody owns that space. But recording private interactions is where the line needs to be drawn. Be it a private text, or recording what time I have gone to bed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some massive reasons why you need to care: proliferation of arcane criminal laws and prosecutorial discretion. In combination with extensive surveillance of everyone, these form an unholy trinity that allows those in power to squash anyone they want to. How does it work? Let me start at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What is the criminal justice system? In many people&amp;#39;s minds, it is the way that we stop the bad guys. The good guys figure out what the bad guys are doing, catch them at it, and put them in jail, right? That&amp;#39;s the story we tell to children and many people never understand it any better than that. But it&amp;#39;s all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What the criminal justice system really is is the machine we have built to apply legitimate civil force. It&amp;#39;s a weapon: in every arrest, after every trial, is the barrel of a gun pointed at someone and metal cages to restrict their movement. But at whom is it pointed? And who&amp;#39;s in the cages? That depends on how you build the machine and who is operating it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So how have we built the machine? We&amp;#39;ve built it so that there are so many crimes you cannot avoid committing one. There are literally tens of thousands of crimes at the federal level alone. One legal analyst &lt;a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/1594032556""&gt;wrote a book&lt;/a&gt; arguing that just about everyone commits three federal felonies every day. Though that claim may be exaggerated for effect, the basic proposition that federal criminal law is so comprehensive and vague that nearly anyone could be prosecuted is, if we are honest, hardly debatable. But surely the prosecutors only go after the bad guys, right?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Enter the federal prosecutor and prosecutorial discretion. What this means is that a prosecutor has complete control over who to charge with a crime. Bring him a clearly guilty friend, and he could decline to charge him. Bring him an innocent enemy, and he could charge him. But wait, you say, he&amp;#39;s innocent! Sorry, see above. No one is innocent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many dismiss it as a silly conspiracy theory, but let&amp;#39;s listen to someone who really knows what he is talking about, then Attorney General of the U.S. and future Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, &lt;a href=""http://www.roberthjackson.org/the-man/speeches-articles/speeches/speeches-by-robert-h-jackson/the-federal-prosecutor/""&gt;speaking to the U.S. Attorneys serving under him in 1940:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the prosecutor is obliged to choose his cases, it follows that he can choose his defendants. Therein is the most dangerous power of the prosecutor: that he will pick people that he thinks he should get, rather than pick cases that need to be prosecuted. With the law books filled with a great assortment of crimes, a prosecutor stands a fair chance of finding at least a technical violation of some act on the part of almost anyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And of course thousands of criminal laws have been passed since 1940. The odds of a prosecutor being able to find &amp;quot;at least a technical violation of some act on the part of almost anyone&amp;quot; have only increased. Nevertheless, one might argue that Jackson has only identified a potential problem; surely there are safeguards in place and simple politically motivated prosecutions are not a problem in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you are one of those people, would it surprise you to learn that from 2001-2007, &lt;a href=""http://www.epluribusmedia.org/columns/2007/20070212_political_profiling.html""&gt;the Bush DOJ investigated seven times as many democratic officials as it did republican ones?&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Alternately, how would you view the story of Alabama Governor &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Siegelman""&gt;Don Siegelman,&lt;/a&gt; who was convicted of bribery amidst &lt;a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/opinion/10mon4.html""&gt;claims that the prosecution was politically motivated?&lt;/a&gt;  I can tell you &lt;a href=""http://www.donsiegelman.net/files/Final_Petition.pdf""&gt;what 44 attorneys general thought about the prosecution&lt;/a&gt; - they were concerned that the case &amp;quot;may have had sufficient irregularities as to call into question the basic fairness that is the linchpin of our system of justice.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now this was already a problem well before the whole NSA thing came about. But when you enable those people in control of the system to access a vast wealth of information about the activities of every person in the country, all barriers to prosecution are removed. Criminal prosecutions could easily be brought against all enemies, whether personal or political. A significant but manageable problem turns into a rampaging beast that tramples everyone in its path, and people like you sit on the sidelines and cheer on the destruction, confident that you will not find yourself being trampled. So you say only criminals need to be concerned? I suppose you&amp;#39;re technically right, but the problem is that we live in an age where we are all criminals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
I believe people who commited a crime and are guaranteed not to do it again should not be imprisoned. CMV.,"Let's say a theft goes wrong and someone's son dies. The thief gets away with it because of some legal loophole, and the father decides to take matters into his own hands and kills him.  I don't want to get into an argument on whether what he did was right or wrong. However, I don't believe prison should be used to punish people, but to reform them. If we can guarantee that this person only killed because of extraordinary circumstances, why should he be imprisoned?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prison in our society has three main roles:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Rehabilitation&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Retribution&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Deterrence&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your point only addresses the first one: you argue that if a person can be &amp;quot;proven&amp;quot; (setting aside the issue of how) to have no risk of recidivism, they shouldn&amp;#39;t be imprisoned.  A decent case could be made that there&amp;#39;s little rehabilitation to be done, yes.  However, in that case what&amp;#39;s to &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; people solving such problems with violence and murder, knowing that they won&amp;#39;t suffer any punishment?  There are a lot of people with dead sons, are we going to declare open season on the perpetrators?  Considering that most places have abolished the death penalty, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that we can&amp;#39;t do that.  For that matter, consider cases of negligent death, where the perpetrator wasn&amp;#39;t even truly at fault?  Should their life be forfeit?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Deterrence is important, because it prevents things like the above.  Without punishment even in cases where recidivism is unlikely, there can be no deterrence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, I don&amp;#39;t believe prison should be used to punish people, but to reform them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also used as a deterrent. People will not do bad things if they get punished for them. If we start letting people go after committing crimes, then others will see this as an opportunity to commit crimes scott free. If I know I&amp;#39;ll go to jail for killing someone, I&amp;#39;m far less likely to kill them. This deterrence prevents a huge number of crimes and saves a lot of lives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I think the Confederate flag should be banned from flying at any public or school related event. CMV,"I should probably preface this by saying I am from the north (pa). I just don't understand why the confederate flag is flown ANYWHERE.   I.e.http://www.mybaycity.com/scripts/p3_v2/P3V3-0200.cfm?P3_ArticleID=7070  My understanding is that this flag was created to represent the short lived confederate states of america. This flag, which represents the CSA, then represents everything the CSA stood for I.e. states rights to decide if slavery is legal. I cannot think of a scenario where flying this flag represents anything other than racism. While any number of reasons could be argued as to why the civil war was fought, its obvious slavery was a main cause. A cause the CSA stood firmly behind.   Do people fly the flag as a sense of regional pride? If so is there no other symbol to relate to other than the Confederate flag? One that is intrinsically tied to the subjugation and purchasing of people.  Edit: just wanted to make it clear that I meant flying the flag as done by any governmental organization/public school. Similarly to what u/grizzbruger said along the lines of people having issues with courthouses having the ten commandments displayed.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Man, that took a long time. Sorry bout this. I had to separate the post into two comments. the rest of it will be posted in reply to this one&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Man, it&amp;#39;s been a strange sort of 24 hours. Three different discussions about the Confederate flag! Anyway, I&amp;#39;m going to give my opinion as someone who knows quite a bit about the Civil War and likes the history of the era (though I&amp;#39;m by no means a professional; the closest I&amp;#39;ve come is when I worked as a Park Ranger for a Summer).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First of all: &lt;strong&gt;that is not the Confederate flag.&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people don&amp;#39;t know this, but the rectangular X-shaped flag was never the flag of the CSA. The following flags are the flags of the CSA, in chronological order:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/CSA_FLAG_4.3.1861-21.5.1861.svg""&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/CSA_Flag_21.5.1861-2.7.1861.svg""&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/CSA_Flag_2.7.1861-28.11.1861.svg""&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/CSA_FLAG_28.11.1861-1.5.1863.svg""&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Second_national_flag_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America.svg""&gt;5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Confederate_States_Naval_Ensign_after_May_26_1863.svg""&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Confederate_National_Flag_since_Mar_4_1865.svg""&gt;7&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Flag_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America_%28Third%2C_variant%29.svg""&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The rectangular, X-shaped flag was, from 1863 to 1865, the Confederate Navy Jack. It was also the battle flag for a few of the armies of the Confederacy (including the Army of Tennessee). The flag is also similar to the &lt;a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Battle_flag_of_the_US_Confederacy.svg""&gt;battle flag&lt;/a&gt; of the most well-known Confederate army, the Army of Northern Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The flag that is being flown there has, since the Civil War, sort of caught on as a symbol of the Confederacy, Southern pride, white nationalism, and a number of other things, with those explicitly stated in this sentence being the three most common. Just a little clarification before I give my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr/&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to make a comparison. And I know I&amp;#39;m going to be called out for Godwin&amp;#39;s Law, but it&amp;#39;s honestly the best one I can think of, since everyone knows about it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The swastika. This thing right here: 卐.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What does it mean in itself? The swastika means &amp;quot;to be good.&amp;quot; So I think we can all agree there&amp;#39;s nothing inherently evil with the thing itself. So why do people get so affected by seeing one? Because in the 30&amp;#39;s and 40&amp;#39;s, some asswipe adopted it as his symbol and tried to wipe out the Jews. To this day, neo-Nazis use it to symbolize their affection for white power.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yet, the swastika is still used in the Buddhist and Hindu religions! While I was in Japan, I visited 浅草 (Asakusa), which is known as the cultural center of Tokyo. There is a large temple there (&lt;a href=""http://i.imgur.com/4kcFznC.jpg""&gt;x&lt;/a&gt;) which, though you can&amp;#39;t see it in the picture, has a large swastika on it. Right outside, there was a sign that was &lt;a href=""http://i.imgur.com/cPd70HY.jpg""&gt;covered in swastikas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How come no one got offended (well, at least no one that I know of)? Because it was how the swastikas were being used. They were being used in the Buddhist way, to symbolize being good.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the intent of symbols, not just the meaning of them, that most people (should) care about. So, if there&amp;#39;s a Buddhist with a swastika tattoo, trying to represent being good, it&amp;#39;s not offensive. But if there&amp;#39;s a neo-Nazi with a swastika tattoo, trying to represent antisemitism and white power, it&amp;#39;s definitely offensive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The same symbol, used different ways, means two different things.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What does this mean for the flag? Well, the flag itself has a saltire, which doesn&amp;#39;t really have any offensive connotations. It also has 13 stars, which only represents the 13 states that the Confederacy claimed to have been comprised of (Though Kentucky and Missouri are considered Union states). It directly represents the CSA&amp;#39;s navy, as well as a few of the CSA&amp;#39;s armies. I&amp;#39;ll come back to that in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So what about how it&amp;#39;s used? Sure, if it&amp;#39;s flown as an attempt to represent white power, as the KKK has done, I definitely agree that it should not be done by a government organization. If it&amp;#39;s flown as an attempt to represent &amp;quot;The South shall rise again!&amp;quot; then, again, shouldn&amp;#39;t be done by a government entity, since they&amp;#39;re supposed to be loyal to the US. But I see nothing inherently offensive about flying it to represent Southern pride, or out of respect for the area&amp;#39;s history.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to go back to representing the CSA, because that&amp;#39;s the biggest thing about the flag. People see it and think &amp;quot;Well, it represents the CSA, and the CSA wanted slavery, so it&amp;#39;s offensive.&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s fair to say, for a couple reasons. First of all, what about &lt;a href=""http://www.sonofthesouth.net/revolutionary-war/political/revolutionary-war-flag.jpg""&gt;this flag&lt;/a&gt;? I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s too hard to say that&amp;#39;s not an offensive flag. It&amp;#39;s just the flag flown during the US Revolution. But during that time, the USA practiced slavery! That flag represents a time in our history when it was legal to own humans! If you get angry at the &amp;quot;Confederate flag,&amp;quot; then you should also get angry at this flag.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I know what you&amp;#39;re going to say: that&amp;#39;s different because the USA was created because the people of America felt tyrannized by Great Britain, and they declared independence to be free. Whereas the CSA was only created because they wanted to keep slavery! The creation of the CSA is a very complex thing. If you simplify it, sure, you can say that they seceded just because they wanted to keep slavery. But the people of the CSA, themselves, wanted to secede for the same reason the US declared independence from Britain: they felt as if they were not being represented by their government. You have to understand that, before the Civil War, the South&amp;#39;s economy &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; slavery. Without slavery, the entire Southern economy would have crashed. It was dependent on slavery. So when this hotshot from Illinois from some new &amp;quot;Republican&amp;quot; party got elected on the voted of many Abolitionists, with many people thinking that he was just going to end slavery, the South was scared. South Carolina saw Abraham Lincoln being elected as proof that the US government only cared about the northern industrial states and not the southern agricultural states. So they seceded. Then other states followed suit, for one reason or another. Many people thought it was their right to own slaves. Others realized that, if Abraham Lincoln outlawed slavery, their livelihoods would be at stake. Still others wanted to leave because they were loyal to their states, more so than to their country.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just look at Virginia. Virginia did not secede at first. They stayed in the Union when the rest of the South was seceding. As we all know, however, they eventually did secede. Why? Well, in 1861, Abraham Lincoln demanded from the states a number of volunteer troops to join the federal army and wage war against the CSA. The governor of Virginia, John Letcher, responded:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Executive Department, Richmond, Va., April 15, 1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War: Sir: I have received your telegram of the 15th, the genuineness of which I doubted. Since that time I have received your communications mailed the same day, in which I am requested to detach from the militia of the State of Virginia &amp;quot;the quota assigned in a table,&amp;quot; which you append, &amp;quot;to serve as infantry or rifleman for the period of three months, unless sooner discharged.&amp;quot; In reply to this communication, I have only to say that the militia of Virginia will not be furnished to the powers at Washington for any such use or purpose as they have in view. Your object is to subjugate the Southern States, and a requisition made upon me for such an object - an object, in my judgment, not within the purview of the Constitution or the act of 1795 - will not be complied with. You have chosen to inaugurate civil war, and, having done so, we will meet it in a spirit as determined as the administration has exhibited toward the South.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;-Respectfully, John Letcher&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You see, in the Constitution, the 10th Amendment was created to ensure that states had sovereign rights to deal with those things not granted to the federal government in the Constitution. When Abraham Lincoln was elected, many saw the Republicans&amp;#39; aims to limit slavery as an affront to the sovereignty granted to them by the Constitution. A historian makes this point much better than I could:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The decision came from what seemed to many white Virginians the unavoidable logic of the situation: Virginia was a slave state; the Republicans had announced their intention of limiting slavery; slavery was protected by the sovereignty of the state; an attack on that sovereignty by military force was an assault on the freedom of property and political representation that sovereignty embodied. When the federal government protected the freedom and future of slavery by recognizing the sovereignty of the states, Virginia&amp;#39;s Unionists could tolerate the insult the Republicans represented; when the federal government rejected that sovereignty, the threat could no longer be denied even by those who loved the Union.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So Virginia seceded.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(Continued in a reply)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the decision of each State to choose which flag(s) they will fly. Particularly with the States which joined the Confederacy it is indeed a source of pride that they were willing to give up so much for their freedoms, to remain sovereign. So yes there is in fact regional and cultural pride which comes from that. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The other part of your question as to what other symbol can be used to represent the Confederate Flag, well there probably is, but it isn&amp;#39;t necessary. People are entitled to their beliefs but not entitled to not being offended. Many people mistake the Confederate Flag as a symbol of hatred, which some people have adopted, and like a post made earlier about the Swastika just because something is adopted by a particular group doesn&amp;#39;t mean the symbol loses its original meaning. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Confederate Flag, from my point of view, as someone who has tried to study the Civil War, who tries to look at conflicts from all angles not just what we are taught in a History class. The Confederate Flag to me symbolizes the lengths Americans will go to keep the Government from controlling their lives. The North did a lot of terrible things to the South, and many freed slaves went back to fight for the South because the North was destroying their homes. So there is pride in those Confederates as well who weren&amp;#39;t white but still fought for their homes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
I believe that cyberbullying is too broadly attributed and over-blowned in general. CMV,"As it stands, I believe that that people who vilify people who insult people over the internet are being overly-sensitive, and I'm especially annoyed that so many take it so seriously, especially considering how easy is it is to block or ignore.  I also don't consider those who are ""attacked"" for things that they publicly posted should be given as much sympathy as they do. It is, after all, a public forum.  If someone's nudie pictures get released because they were given to another person, I don't think that they are free to blame and are an innocent victim. That's the risk you take when you give something like that to another person  However, I do consider people who ""dox"" people to be a real threat.  I'm sure there is probably some information on my views that might need to be added or elaborated. Please tell me, if anything should be added to my original post, so that I may do so.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In regards to the naked pictures:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you give sexual consent to a person, that consent lasts for a certain period of time.

Uploaded pornography is permanent, and if anybody changes their minds there&amp;#39;s no &amp;#39;taking it back&amp;#39;.

Boy C is a &amp;#39;friend&amp;#39; of B, and while borrowing his phone sees the naked photo and uploads it to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) Girl A does not give the picture to anyone, but has it anyway for her own reasons. She loses the phone and Person B finds the photo and uploads it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) Girl A gives Boy B a naked digital picture. Due to a disagreement, Boy B deliberately and intentionally aims to hurt Girl A by printing off copies of the picture and posting it on walls and billboards around her school/home/workplace etc.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4) Same as (3) but instead of physical copies, it goes to pornhub or a similar website.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;5) Girl A gives Boy B a naked picture while under the effects of alcohol/drugs. It is later uploaded.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;6) Girl A gives Boy B a naked picture while suffering from a mental condition. It is later uploaded.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You recognise doxing as a threat, but given that the action of uploading without &amp;#39;true&amp;#39; consent is probably malicious with the disregard or even intention of the girl being recognised, how is this not a serious form of bullying?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe the problem is not that &amp;quot;cyberbullying&amp;quot; is too broadly attributed, its that its not some new form,  its just bullying.

I do not trust veterinarians due to my perceived lack of regulation and the lack of communication possible from pets making it hard to do anything evidence-based. CMV,"I perceive that there is a lack of regulations (compared to human medicine), and thus a lack of quality, accuracy, and price of service, with pets.  It it obvious that people get panicky about pet illnesses and will pay whatever the vet says to fix it.  Pets cannot communicate well, so it is very difficult to measure the efficacy of the treatment, or whether an existing problem is being treated at all (and not just what the vet says ""might happen"" ""just in case"" etc.)  It's already ridiculously hard enough to adequately diagnose problems on a human patient fully able to communicate things.  All of these factors should give incentive for vets to lie and overcharge about everything, just like people's worry of a stereotypical shady car mechanic.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pets cannot communicate well, so it is very difficult to measure the efficacy of the treatment, or whether an existing problem is being treated at all (and not just what the vet says &amp;quot;might happen&amp;quot; &amp;quot;just in case&amp;quot; etc.) It&amp;#39;s already ridiculously hard enough to adequately diagnose problems on a human patient fully able to communicate things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This depends a lot on the exact problem being treated, its symptoms, and the treatment prescribed. For example, my family cat once swallowed a plum pit for reasons only she understood. The pit obstructed her intestines, which caused her to be unable to poop, and to vomit a lot. The vet confirmed this with a scan of some kind (I don&amp;#39;t remember the exact type, perhaps it was an X-ray), and performed surgery to remove the pit. Afterwards, she was fine. Her ailment was very easy to diagnose based on evidence, and the effectiveness of the treatment was immediately apparent because she started pooping again and stopped vomiting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a tortoise.  When I first got her from the store she had a respiratory infection.  It&amp;#39;s a common condition for tortoises of her type and the guy at the store even warned me about the possibility.  The symptoms are pretty clear and the tortoise forums I went on all confirmed what I thought.  I went to the vet, she double confirmed and prescribed an antibiotic.  I gave it to my tortoise as directed and her symptoms went away.  It&amp;#39;s pretty much the exact same thing I would have done if I had some symptoms and needed a doctor.

CMV: Moving to the US feels like the wrong choice,"I work in IT, and occasionally i receive calls / emails from US-based headhunters wanting to discuss job offers in the US. Although some of these offers sound promising (either because of the company name or because of the compensation), i feel very reluctant to discuss them because i believe i won't like it living / working in the US.  **Background**: Our family of 3 (wife, 6-year old kid and me) live and work in Sweden. Although not a paradise (for a number of reasons), it feels like a very decent country to live in. Below i will list some of the things i like about Sweden and what i ""believe"" i know about the US. My assumption, that i don't want to move, is based on the things i ""believe"" i know about the US.  **Compensation**: Salaries seem much better in the US (both on paper and assuming that taxation is higher in Sweden). However, some huge differences seem to exist between different areas in the US (based on salaries listed on salary.com).  Vacation days seem also to be quite different. In Sweden the norm seems to be 25-30 vacation days per year, while in the US is 15-21 (?). Plus, vacation and sick days are totally different pools. When you get sick you are not paid for the first day, but you receive full pay up to day 14 of sickness. Not sure how this works in the US.  Lastly, we have what we call the VAB. This basically means that i can stay at home to take care of my sick kid and be paid 80% of my salary (for that day). Anything equivalent in the US?  **Education**: Although i believe that graduate and post-graduate education in the US is much better than in Sweden, the fact that i will have to pay a huge amount of money for tuition (university) scares me. In Sweden, all grades of education are free.  **Healthcare**: Sweden has a state supported health system, which means that worst case scenario i will pay in a year approx $120 for doctor visits (medication not included). Even operations and ""longer"" treatment is covered by this amount. This is definitely not the picture i have from the US, where a sickness can destroy you financially.  **Society**: The Swedish society seems ""calmer"" that what i believe happens in the US. There are of course cases of racism and public disobedience, but not to the extend of Fergusson or some other similar events. Basically, if you live in Sweden, it feels like moving to a ""war zone"" if you move to the US.  At times, it also feels that the US is returning to the dark ages: Heavy religion influences, tele-evangelists, the Indiana law, ""wars"" outside abortion clinics, fights about gay rights, black/white racism, etc. A huge difference from what i am used to in Sweden  **Epilogue**: So this is my (probably) narrow-minded view of the US, as i perceive it by reading news online (and watching the Last Week Tonight show). So, please CMV that moving to the US is a much better ""thing"" than what i have currently in my mind.  **Edit 1**: A lot of you have made good points about the move to the US. So far there wasn't a single entry that makes me change my mind, but combined you guys and gals have strong arguments. As this is Easter Sunday in Sweden i will now retire and i will come back tomorrow morning where i will start awarding deltas to people who had made good arguments. Thanks to everyone who participated in the discussion so far!  **Edit 2**: I have awarded some deltas, based on the amount and quality of information provided by the posters. The main points seem to be:  * Negotiate, negotiate, negotiate * Don't expect anything from the government * Make sure your health insurance is covered * Prefer urban over rural areas (to get a more liberal culture) * Save up money for the kid's university education * US is not a warzone, it's as safe as Sweden * Media overblows everything (and focuses on the negative)  Thanks to all who contributed, i learnt a lot, and now i know at least how to continue my research!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, a couple things.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First off, the media (both sides) revels in making all events more intense than they seem. Life in the US is just as calm as it is in Sweden. I live in Chicago, and often times I hear about protests and demonstrations about who-knows-what that occurred in my city, and I never even saw a whiff. Quite simply, life in the US is more or less the same as in European countries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, your financial questions are vastly more important. Essentially what you will be doing is swapping the allocation of your money and risk potential.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll break it down:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the US (for IT professionals):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Salary: High to Very High&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Healthcare: Potentially Low to Potentially Very High&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Education: Potentially Free to Potentially Very High&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sweden (from the sounds of it)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Salary: Medium-High&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Healthcare: Essentially Free&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Education: Free&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By going to the US, you will probably raise the bar on your salary potential. I believe even at $250k+/year, you can still reasonably pay an effective tax rate % of somewhere in the mid-thirties.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you have a good health plan from your job, it will vary. If you have a high deductible PPO, it means you might pay the first few thousand dollars out of pocket, but have the option of going to any doctor you want. If you have an HMO, you pay very little out of pocket for visits, but are limited in choice. Either way, you will still have to pay roughly 100-400/mo in insurance costs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Education: You will be a resident in some state, and when your children go to college they will get in-state tuition if they go to a state school. If they go out of state or to a prestigious private university, they will probably end up paying a lot out of pocket. There are scholarships to lessen this, but that is an uncontrollable variable because it depends on the scholastic success of your kids.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you think about your compensation as X, and education, healthcare, social programs, and taxes as A, B, C, and D, in the US you get to separate those variables. In Sweden, you just have X and D, as everything else basically gets rolled into your much higher taxes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of examples where you could get a much better return on your money spent by living in America, but you also might not. If you move here and suddenly a family member gets cancer, and then your kid goes to Harvard, well then you might end up &amp;quot;worse off&amp;quot; financially than you would have in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But if you come here, get a big raise, pay less taxes, have a family in general good health with kids that get good grades and go to fine state schools, then you will probably come out on top.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would honestly ignore any social qualms that you may have about the US as some sort of chaotic place. Perhaps come visit the US and see how it&amp;#39;s one big media sham to drum up controversy. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I forgot to mention sick days/vacation. This is massively dependent on your company. If you work for a big box corporation with 10k+ employees, your vacation/sick time might not be very good, something around 2 weeks per yer with sick days counting as vacation. But if you work for a smaller, more flexible firm, with good negotiation skills you can probably get something a little closer to the European model. But honestly, don&amp;#39;t expect it to be too crazy. Most American workplaces have an almost negative view of too much time off, it&amp;#39;s kind of strange.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In summary, no one can tell you if America will be better. The American model places more responsibility into your hands, and therefore increases risk. The potential reward is higher, but so is the potential loss.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit: I forgot to mention. The US is so big that you have a whole bunch of microcultures. If you don&amp;#39;t like the whole hyper-religious aspect of all that shit you see on the news, just don&amp;#39;t work in any of those states. Work in Oregon, or Washington, or California, Colorado or the East Coast. Or any big city really. There are enough microcultures in the US that you will have more than enough choice on what type of people you want to live near.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Looks people have already covered my points while I was writing this essay, so you can probably disregard&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, this really a personal matter, but maybe I can provide some clarity. the US has no standard paid vacation or sick leave, these aren&amp;#39;t required by law, but many employers will provide something. If your being headhunted for IT aboard, your probably going get a 2-3 weeks paid vacation, maybe more if your particularly high up. My dad is an executive for a tech company and he gets 3 weeks, my sister is a veterinarian gets 4 weeks, and myself when I worked in a grocery store got two weeks, so its something you&amp;#39;ll have to work out with your employer, there is no standard. Education is different in the US. For primary and secondary, public schools vary widely, but your average upper middle class and middle class high schools are at least competent and most will have programs for advanced placement for students who do well. What you want to avoid are more eclectic school with kids from lower income areas as that where see the fighting, racism, and other issues. My parents specifically moved to where I grew up because the good school district and I believe I got a high quality education. College is expensive in the US but it can managed. Community colleges provide the first two years at reasonable prices and they&amp;#39;re talking about making them free. Universities are expensive, above $50,000 for private universities and certain out state cost, but there are many state schools that provide quality education in $20-35,000 a year range some even under. Varies by state though. There are also numerous scholarships available from the universities and other groups to bring down the costs. Also, the government allows you to set up a &amp;quot;gift to minor account&amp;quot; in which you can put in money tax free that can used to pay for their college. It reverts to their control at 21 though, so make sure they understand that the money is for school and using anything left over to get settled in a job. There is a lot of great educational opportunities in the US, you have to really look for them and weigh your options.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Healthcare is done through private insurance in the US. At your level your employer should provide health insurance, if they don&amp;#39;t, don&amp;#39;t take the job, but any decent sized company is required to. There are exchanges but I&amp;#39;ve heard they&amp;#39;re highly variable in the quality of the plans. Be very clear what the details of the plan a potential employer provides. They all have a deductible, which means you pay up to a certain amount in case of a medical issue, then insurance covers costs after that. They can be quite high, often several thousand dollars, but a good plan can be one to two thousand and you can set up a health savings account where you put money tax free that can be used for health expense such as your deductible. Health plans have a monthly cost which your employer will cover partially but not entirely. Most plans provide for some doctor visits and general check ups. Dentistry and vision often have specific plans and aren&amp;#39;t always completely covered.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Swedish society is definitely calmer, but the US is no warzone, most of that is media hype (our news media trash by the way, so that&amp;#39;s something you have to deal with). The religious right is political loud, but relatively absent from day to day life. Evolution is still taught, birth control is widely available, and if someone in your family really needs an abortion you can get it, though you might have to jump through hoops but the protesters are generally prevented from harassing patrons of clinics and most are peaceful. The US is diverse, one of its best features but also a source discord. Racism is still an issue but race riots as seen in Ferguson are exceedingly rare. Communities occasionally have flare ups in racial tension but they rarely result in violence. Most Americans are perfectly comfortable interacting with people of other races and cultures and often are fascinated with foreigners, particularly Europeans. Americans are somewhat ignorant at times, you&amp;#39;ll almost certainly get people who mistake you for other nationalities and many will know very little about Sweden, but most mean well. There are wide differences between different states, cities and even areas within cities, but as with schools, middle class areas tend to be alright with low crime and generally peaceful conditions. Our politics are crazy, but really have little of effect on day to day life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If I am honest the US might not be right you. A lot of things the Swedish government manages for you, you&amp;#39;re on own for here. So while you might make more money, there are a lot of things to worry about that aren&amp;#39;t an issue in Sweden. But that be said it is a great place and you and you&amp;#39;re will experience a cultural breadth that you simply can&amp;#39;t find anywhere else. There are so many unique and interesting places to go, people meet and things to experience. And I still truly believe it is still the land of opportunity and if your diligent and ambition, you can do things and rise to heights you never thought possible. You&amp;#39;ll have to weigh whether it is worth uprooting your family and learning all the complexities of the US, but while we aren&amp;#39;t without our issues, far from it, it is great place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: Intelligence is fixed at birth and there is no point in studying hard in high school to get good grades,"I believe that we are all only as intelligent as our parents - some will absorb information easier than others, and that's okay.   In Primary and Secondary schooling, there is no use in memorising facts in order to improve grades - exams, which need to exist to sort the levels and/or areas of intelligence should be a test of one's person, not what they know.   This view has come about after seeing how much some students stress about exams and how they students that study the hardest often have the hardest time keeping up in gifted and talented education, because although they are capable of doing the work, they are putting in so much effort that it pulls them down in other areas eg social skills. The students of whom less is expected in terms of work, but do well (not 100%, but definitely above average) due to natural ability appear to have an easier ride.   I believe that everyone should just accept at what they are and aren't talented and continue with their life, not trying so desperately hard to get top marks in everything. At the end of the day, a pass is a pass, and there is more to life than exams.  Edit: Just to emphasise, I am only talking about in primary and secondary school, not in life in general, or in tertiary education - which I believe is where the real effort is put in and everyone should try to accomplish their maximum potential.  Edit 2: I'm saying that a low pass can be considered success if it allows you to use the time you would have spent studying to grow in other areas, and that's the view I want challenged/changed.

Yes, intelligence means you&amp;#39;ll have it much easier. But smart people either have to work hard, or accept mediocrity- you cannot accomplish anything meaningful as a lazy and smart person because you generally can&amp;#39;t accomplish anything as a lazy person.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If your goal is not simply to get by in life, but to achieve a position of influence or to accomplish something meaningful, you need to work hard. This begins by studying hard for exams to acquire the knowledge you need to succeed and to build up a good work ethic for later. Now, maybe this doesn&amp;#39;t apply to something like business so much, but in the hard sciences, the stuff you learn in primary and secondary education is stuff that is so basic you need to be be able to know it instantly and efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, if you just want an easy ride in life, sure. If you&amp;#39;re smart enough, you can put forth minimal effort and get by in college with some random office job at the end of it. But that&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;being who you are.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s just a choice you made that you&amp;#39;d rather have a comfortable life than an accomplished one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re ignoring completely that life often requires even very talented people to work very hard to achieve their goals.  If people are taught to give up whenever they encounter a situation where they aren&amp;#39;t a &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot;, they would not develop the perseverance necessary to accomplish things later in life.  Also, most material in primary and secondary schooling is basic material.  One might have a &amp;quot;knack&amp;quot; for calculus, but if they simply give up during algebra, they will never progress to discover their talents.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, it&amp;#39;s factually incorrect to assert that intelligence is fixed from parents&amp;#39; intelligence.  We know that many things can affect intelligence, including nutrition while in the womb, environmental factors (lead paint/pipes in homes), early childhood nutrition, etc.  A study released recently showed that people who hear more and different words in their first years of life often develop much stronger vocabularies.  That has nothing to do with genetics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
I believe there should be no such thing as inheritance. CMV.,"Every person should earn their own in life, and not have it handed to them. I think this would solve a lot of problems that occur due to the segregation of upper and lower classes.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 100% estate tax can have some really bad consequences. Take a family farm, for example. Someone owns the land, capital, and money used to keep the farm going. Then that person dies and one of his children, who also lives on the farm, takes over. In cases like that, a large estate tax puts the farm out of business. Most cases of inheritance will probably be somewhere between this case and dead-beat-trust-fund-babies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you also believe that parents shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to give their children money and assets while they&amp;#39;re still alive? There are many ways parents can give their children an inheritance without technically giving them an inheritance, thus problems of upper and lower classes won&amp;#39;t be solved unless you also prevent parents from giving their children money and assets while they are still alive.

CMV:Cannabis is a strong psychoactive substance and whether or not it is less dangerous than alcohol or tobacco has no bearing on its legality,"One of the key arguments for the decriminalisation and legalisation of cannabis (marijuana; active ingredient THC) is that it is no more dangerous than two currently legal drugs: alcohol and tobacco. ""Dangerous"" is a fluid term and may refer to mortality or morbidity or both, though I don't want this post to focus on this aspect of the aspect of the argument.  I do not see what relevance the legality of alcohol/tobacco has on deciding whether a completely different substance should be freely available or not. Just because cannabis is potentially no more dangerous than other drugs does not mean it should be freely available. If anything, someone admitting that alcohol/tobacco are dangerous should be seeking to limit availability/legality of those drugs, not adding new ones to the mix.  I hold this view because the legalisation of cannabis will add to the global health burden, and treatment of diseases associated with cannabis use will divert funds away from other areas. The argument that cannabis should be legal because alcohol/tobacco are seems to be a fallacy in itself.  CMV, please! _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

CMV: It makes no sense that women are more afraid of walking around alone than men are,"It makes no sense to me that women are more afraid of violent crime than men, and furthermore, that feminists, who are supposedly trying to make women's lives better, encourage this irrational belief. (By ""irrational"" I mean ""not founded in the actual state of the real world, but instead based on a gut feeling or faith or whatever"")  Men are far more likely to be the victim of violent crime than women are. Men make up the vast majority of assault, battery, and murder victims. There are nearly ten times as many assaults as rapes. If you include ""forced to penetrate someone against your will"" as a form of rape (and don't include prison rape), the odds of a man being raped in a given year are nearly identical to the odds of a woman being raped in that year. Furthermore, rape (the only violent crime where a case can be made for women being more at risk than men) is nearly always committed by someone known to the victim, indoors, in a place known to the victim and assailant (such as a bar, one of their houses, a mutual friend's house, etc). Assault, conversely, takes place mostly outside, committed by strangers.  And yet, women are consistently more afraid of walking around outside (at night, alone, but also in general) than men are. This makes no sense to me: change my view.  There is also a second, related issue that I am confused by. I see articles written by and linked on Facebook etc by self-professed feminists which strongly encourage this (seemingly irrational) fear. For example: http://kateharding.net/2009/10/08/guest-blogger-starling-schrodinger%E2%80%99s-rapist-or-a-guy%E2%80%99s-guide-to-approaching-strange-women-without-being-maced/  This also makes no sense to me. Women are less at risk of this than men, and being afraid all the time sucks, and since they're less at risk than men this fear serves no useful purpose to them, so all that writing this sort of article does is make women's lives worse. Yet when I say that, I get yelled at and dog piled by the feminists who link these articles, who call me a misogynist, sexist, an uncaring and unfeeling ass, and on and on.  That makes negative sense to me, and has caused me to self-identify as an anti-feminist, because the overwhelming majority of feminist thought I encounter is of the form ""women should hold this harmful irrational belief"" or ""men are evil"" or ""no man has ever suffered"". A slight exaggeration, but only slight (sometimes they make very legitimate points about economics). This seeming total lack of ability (or willingness?) to think about these issues rationally combined with people calling me anti-feminist when I point out that this is irrational has convinced me that I am (and should be!) against the actual existing-in-the-real-world thing called ""feminism"" (as opposed to the ""women should have the same rights as men, including the right to walk around without fear"" definition of feminism, which I am enthusiastically in favor of, and which seems diametrically opposed to feminism-in-practice).  Change my view, please. It would make my life a lot easier if I didn't believe these things. Only actual real world data has any significant chance of changing my mind, but I am also curious to hear the non-data-driven arguments, so as to better understand where the people who disagree with me are coming from and why they believe what they believe.

I wasn&amp;#39;t always afraid to walk around alone or at night.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a child, (girl), I didn&amp;#39;t want to be left behind, or get lost, and I&amp;#39;m sure that&amp;#39;s pretty common. But I didn&amp;#39;t worry about being alone, or really even worry that much about strangers. I was told to be scared of strangers. I knew they might do something bad. But I grew up in such a sheltered loving family with no abuse (thank you dear god) and all that scary talk was just talk to me. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In middle school something strange happened. Everyone else got really big. I went from looking into the eyes of my peers to looking at their chests. I felt little in a way I had never felt before. OF COURSE adults were bigger than me. &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; were &amp;#39;grown ups.&amp;#39; But kids? Kids weren&amp;#39;t grown ups. What business did they have being bigger than me?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In high school it became more pronounced. I was a short person. Okay. 5&amp;#39;2&amp;quot; is short. Fine. I&amp;#39;m not tall. Just about everyone (male and female) was taller than me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then it happened again in college. I wasn&amp;#39;t just short anymore. I was &lt;em&gt;tiny.&lt;/em&gt; Boys got &lt;em&gt;BIG.&lt;/em&gt; They were already tall, but now they got wider, stronger. Their bodies continued to grow in mass, in strength. I used to be able to wrestle people, to hold my own and even win sometimes. Forget that, that&amp;#39;s not happening anymore. I started to feel little all the time. And men just looked huge to me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But wait! It wasn&amp;#39;t just me!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Holy crap, all women looked small! Even women that work out, even women that weight lifted with me looked small standing next to men. Something about bones, about the way muscle fit into the bones. They looked breakable. It looked like it would be really, really  easy to hurt them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And I saw some of that. I also saw men get hurt, attacked or mugged, or just beat in a friendly grappling match. But it didn&amp;#39;t look as easy. It took some amount of work. My friend was trapped in a room with a her boyfriend just by him standing in front of the door. That was it, all he had to do. I was held down, causally, with one arm. One arm was all it took to incapacitate me. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And now I am nervous, sometimes, some places, when I&amp;#39;m by myself. &lt;em&gt;(But, honestly, I&amp;#39;m much more scared to be alone in private with men/a man than I am out in public, on the streets. Alone in a room, a house, you are fucked. Just totally fucked. On the streets, who knows? maybe someone will walk by.)&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;m nervous because I know how very easy it is to hurt me. How very little I can do to fight back, without a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t mean I think all men are dangerous. And I really, really,  don&amp;#39;t like that I have to consider all unknown men a danger. I hate to insult you that way. Really I do. But the thing is, my ability to fight back, to protect myself is small. Really, really small. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Unless I have a weapon. Then I will not be the fucked one.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;EDIT after &lt;a href=""/u/PerturbedPlatypus""&gt;/u/PerturbedPlatypus&lt;/a&gt;: I don&amp;#39;t actually think women should be more scared of strangers/men than men should be of strangers/other men. I was just explaining why &lt;em&gt;I personally&lt;/em&gt; feel fear. And while it&amp;#39;s not based on statistics, I don&amp;#39;t think it exactly falls into the category of irrational. I have personally known smaller men who were beaten so badly they spent weeks in the ICU after being mugged. I do not mean to say men shouldn&amp;#39;t also be afraid. There are bad people out there. And unless you are someone who is ready to defend against them, fearing them just makes sense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women get harassed on the street on a regular basis. &lt;a href=""http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/resources/statistics/statistics-academic-studies/""&gt;The studies that have been done on it show that it&amp;#39;s a major problem.&lt;/a&gt; This is a systemic problem. While not all of these end in assaults, they can sometimes be scary. Once I was on a train, and a guy was leering at me, looking up and down my body, that sort of thing. I got off at my stop and he followed me, coming up right next to me and whispering in my ear how sexy I was and what he wanted. I bolted and ran away as fast as I could, but I was terrified. As a 5&amp;#39;1&amp;quot; girl, I would be nearly powerless if he took what he wanted by force.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1/6 women will have rape attempted on them in their lifetime (with a large number succeeding). That&amp;#39;s a huge problem. Statistics like these are drilled into our heads. When I first went to college, they straight up told us not to go out at night alone, not to go places without someone else. This is a big part of why women are afraid; we&amp;#39;re told that we have to be. I know that rape culture is a difficult thing to convince people of, but whenever I saw a report of a woman being assaulted there would always be remarks of &amp;quot;well, she shouldn&amp;#39;t have been walking alone at night&amp;quot; or something like that. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Women are harassed on a remarkable level and are told that we should be afraid.

Pirating isn't immoral if you would not have bought the product anyway. CMV,"I'm aware that there's quite a bit of controversy over pirating, and I'm not going to get into a very broad discussion of it. I simply believe that if I would not have bought the product anyway (I'm way too broke to buy most software/games/music) then it's not stealing, because while I'm hypothetically making use of a product I'm also not decreasing their possible profits from said product. In fact, in this entirely hypothetical situation, it would inspire me to support my favorite producers - on the rare occasion that I am willing to shell out some money to support something, having access to something in order to know that it's an excellent product makes a big difference. If I were to decide that I liked it so much that the producer deserves some increased revenue, I might be willing to support them. This usually occurs through me buying merchandise from a musician, buying the sequel to a game, etc. It also ensures that I visit websites related to the product and advertise the product online. Change my view.  UPDATE: As per /u/themcos 's argument here http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1yhd8w/pirating_isnt_immoral_if_you_would_not_have/cfkunw0, my view has been changed by the issue of disrespecting the creator.   I'd like to reiterate from my comments below that this was never an argument trying to validate pirates, this was a hypothetical argument for the morality of piracy. I was here, after all, looking for new insight. I wasn't looking for someone to tell me whether or not I would buy something.  UPDATE 2: After further reflection, I'm not really sure how this form of respect gets incorporated into my current moral system. It feels right to apply morality to it, I'm just reflecting on the implications of that. So in light of that (and all the other wonderful arguments going on in this thread) I would like to say thank you all for participating and helping me come to new conclusions on morality in general!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;if I would not have bought the product anyway  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How do you know this?  The fact you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; pirate something already influences your decision and your claim regarding it.&lt;br/&gt; If there is an artist you like a lot, and you pirate the album and someone says something you can always claim, in self-delusion or outright lie: &amp;quot;I wouldn&amp;#39;t have bought it anyway&amp;quot; and turn your piracy into something moral.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Being broke is not a good argument, in the same way being poor is no argument for stealing, because being broke means you have to abstain from many material things, why are you not abstaining from these too?  If piracy were not an option, I am sure you would direct a nonzero amount of your savings to purchase what you are pirating, so this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; effectively decreasing the industry revenue/profit.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think your view is a circular argument even if we ignore the morality of it.  For you to back it up you&amp;#39;d have to be sure that every single item you have pirated ever was something you would not have bought had you had the money.  If the value of the pirated item is zero to you, then you paid zero and your argument kinda looks good again.  The fact you went through the hassle of obtaining it, probably having to circumvent protections, means the value of the content is not zero, yet you paid zero.  If after pirating it you dislike it and delete it to free up the disk space I would agree that what you did, while illegal, is not immoral for the reasons you pointed out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, here&amp;#39;s my take, broken into a few sections:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legality&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#39;t think this is what you&amp;#39;re talking about, but I thought I&amp;#39;d mention it briefly anyway. When we&amp;#39;re talking about legality, we might talk about what &amp;quot;rights&amp;quot; a person or entity has or doesn&amp;#39;t have. We might also lump together people as single faceless business entities. I do think that it is &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; that we have laws that make piracy illegal in principle, even if these laws are difficult to enforce, and I don&amp;#39;t always agree with how they&amp;#39;re enforced when they are. But I think that the legality of piracy is pretty much a totally separate issue than what your CMV is about.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Harm&lt;/strong&gt; - Most of the discussion here seems to be about the extent to which piracy causes any financial harm. If I create something and you pirate it, I&amp;#39;m not actually &lt;em&gt;losing&lt;/em&gt; anything, so where&amp;#39;s the harm. This actually isn&amp;#39;t the main angle I&amp;#39;d use to approach the morality of piracy, but there is a point I think is important. You claim that you &amp;quot;wouldn&amp;#39;t&amp;quot; have bought it anyway and have described the product as having some value relative to other priorities in your life (food, clothing, etc) and that there&amp;#39;s a disconnect between this value and what the listed price of the software is. This justifies your belief that you wouldn&amp;#39;t have bought it anyway, as it didn&amp;#39;t have enough value. This is all fine, but I &lt;strong&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/strong&gt; think you can honestly claim that your value assessment of the product is not affected by the possibility of pirating it for free. The mere fact that torrenting it is even an option that your considering reduces the value of the product, and thus unfairly raises the bar for what you&amp;#39;re willing to pay for. So indirectly, I&amp;#39;d argue that the way piracy affects your value judgments and purchasing decisions &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; result in actual list sales for content right near the threshold of what you&amp;#39;d be willing to buy. You can &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; wiggle out of this if the buyer is &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; honest and self-aware, but in general, I&amp;#39;m really skeptical that anyone can really honestly be sure of what choices they&amp;#39;d make &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; piracy wasn&amp;#39;t on the table. But I&amp;#39;ll concede that if you have a really large bold &lt;strong&gt;IF&lt;/strong&gt; qualifying your claim, maybe there&amp;#39;s no financial impact.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morality&lt;/strong&gt; - But like I said, that&amp;#39;s not really the angle I&amp;#39;d use to argue that piracy is immoral. That&amp;#39;s actually a lot simpler the way I see it. I&amp;#39;m a human being, and if I work hard and create something, I might &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt; you to pay me something in exchange for reaping the benefits my hard work. Its not about &amp;quot;rights&amp;quot;; Those are for the lawyers. Its about you respecting my wishes as one human being to another. Simple as that. If I work hard at something and then you completely ignore how I request you to treat my work and use it without my permission, that&amp;#39;s kind of a dick move. Period.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the game of thrones producers or the folks at adobe &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; mind you pirating their stuff, the moral concern dissipates. But that&amp;#39;s not always the case, and when its not, you need to be honest about how you are or aren&amp;#39;t respecting their wishes as human beings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV I don't believe in God anymore, but I would like to....","I used to believe in the KJV Jesus as presented by the Baptists. I grew out of this when I started seeing all the typical logical atheist arguments you see online. Sometimes I wonder if I'm a victim of my time... Like if I were born 80 years ago I would be a devout Christian, and I'm only an atheist because it's popular (I mean that the arguments are repeated enough that I succumbed to them, not that I go with the most popular thing).   So, some problems I have with believing in God:  How do I know I have the right God? Maybe I only believe in the American Jesus... While another part of the world believes in Vishnu. What if they're right? It seems like it's just fixed on wherever you are....  How does the physical world reconcile with scripture (genesis, when read literal, appears to deny evolution)?  If there is a god, and he created all of this, isn't he just a powerful alien? How is religion really that different from science fiction?   How can someone who created the universe care about me individually? I've started to feel like that is just brought in to encourage the peasants to listen to the church.   I'll post more if I think of it later...

CMV: All theistic religion is cancer.,"I see all theistic religion as cancerous. In my opinion, it is the root of everything wrong in the world and will be the death of the human race. I will admit that some religious people are genuinely good people, but on the whole, not so much. No matter how altruistic or accepting a religious person may be, they always seem to infect their children with this abusive lie that they will burn in hell for eternity because they act on some of the most natural human urges.

There are some bad things bout religion, but there are some good things it brings for the people who call themselves religious. Regardless of what your personal thoughts about religion are, there are somethings that they do that are positive. Two I can think if that they give people a sense of community in a potential lonely world and they often participate in programs to help their fellow man. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You realize when you&amp;#39;re saying this you&amp;#39;re suggesting that flaws in human nature like greed and the love of power are irrelevant right? If religion is truly the source of all problems, then not only does human nature not negativly affect society, but resource inequities, especially access to water for crops and drinking, also aren&amp;#39;t a major cause of disputes. As an example, Islamic terrorism is generally, I don&amp;#39;t want to assume your position on it but I&amp;#39;m going to for a second, to be a problem with Islam, but if that&amp;#39;s true then the legitimate grievances of people that have been pushed around by the economic imperialists, the US and the rest of the western world that uses a disproportionate amount of resources, would just do nothing about the abuse they&amp;#39;ve taken. I honestly don&amp;#39;t see how someone can hold that position if you consider how little pushing it takes for many people, religious and secular, to get violent. I suppose you&amp;#39;re probably thinking that while religion isn&amp;#39;t the only cause it could still be the root. Let&amp;#39;s consider the Russian revolution for a second, during the Russian revolution poor and often abused peasants and the new industrial working class exucted the bourgeoisie and the tsar. Is there a religious root to the conflict, the I&amp;#39;ll remind you was extremely bloody and bordered on genocide if you consider the rich a group you can commit genocide on? Well the upper class of Russia certainly was religious, but so were most of poor peasants and industrial workers, they were mostly believers in the same religion, so it can&amp;#39;t be seen as a clash between religions or between religious and nonreligious.  Was religion the root of the economic disparity in Russia? Well probably not because while religion possibly helped enrich the upper class in Russia there was nothing stopping them from enacting liberal reforms that would&amp;#39;ve contented enough people to avoid the war, there especially wasn&amp;#39;t any religious tenet stopping them from doing that. No, these are people that were used to a level of power and wealth and wanted to keep things as they were out of self-interest.

CMV,"The post in its entirety refers to the generalization of groups fighting for equal rights, however for an example in this post, I will be specifically discussing groups fighting for LGBTQ equality.  Recently in the United States, the issue of gay marriage has been a ""hot topic"" with New Mexico being the 17th state to legalize the issue. While this shows progress for the issue, I think that most LBGTQ groups (especially in schools) are a detriment to the cause for the following reasons:  * 1. Events (such as the ""Day of Silence"") don't efficiently promote the issue at hand and people participating in the event a) do so without full knowledge of the purpose behind the event and b) don't fully participate. Using the day of silence as an example, typically in high schools, LBGTQ groups will hold a ""Day of Silence"" where participants will willingly not communicate for the day. The ""purpose"" of this event is to raise awareness about how LGBTQ people are forced to be silent about there sexual orientation in public. This is detrimental to the cause of equal rights because the fundamental purpose of the event is flawed. Gay people are fully capable of talking about their orientation, and while someone may make a second glance at two people of the same gender engaging in PDA, this is reasonable as Gay people are in-fact an anomaly(couldn't think of a better word).Second, the people who participate usually use white boards or write notes to communicate which defeats the entire purpose of the flawed event. * 2. The most active members of the group typically are the people on the most extreme end of the spectrum, IE: the people that make other citizens weary of supporting the group. One example of this would be this recent event in Argentina: http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/between-errands-april-thompson/2013/dec/5/argentina-women-attack-church-while-men-try-protec/  * 3. Even if the least flamboyant members of the group manage to run a successful event, it typically does nothing to change the situation at hand and only manages to raise awareness of the issue. This may be beneficial for smaller-known issues, but for issues such as sexual-freedom, feminism, racial equality, etc., these issues already have everyones awareness.  As far as arguments go, I will not accept exceptions to the case (specifically Martin Luther King's march on Washington). I will however accept trends and statistics for groups and states corresponding legislature, series of smaller-group events that had an effect on a community, etc. Also anything else you can think of to make me believe that equal-rights groups do less harm than good.  tldr;Citizens as a whole who feel they receive unfair treatment would be better off contacting their local legislation than creating groups for their cause.  edit: For the sake of argument, I only wish to include modern examples. I am aware of the mid-1900's movement for equal rights, however i think that modern groups have a different ideology than older groups and are ineffective.  edit2: Awarded ∆'s to all who shared the same view as /u/MageZero","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have the sound of someone too young to have seen how equality groups change opinion &lt;em&gt;over time&lt;/em&gt;. You seem to young to have seen the gradual change of public opinion when it comes to race, or gender, or orientation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The dirty little secret to the evolution of rights being extended is that it&amp;#39;s never done in one generation. Young people are convinced first, while there are people who are so set in their ways that they cannot be convinced, they eventually die.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You think that gay marriage is a &amp;quot;hot topic&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s not. That battle has already been won, especially with people under 30, and there has been a lot of movement in the generation between 30-50. In 20 years, most people under 70 are going to see nothing wrong with gay marriage.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s precisely because of equality groups that these topics get on the table in the first place. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;you may not like the extremists causing a ruckus about a controversial issue because it doesn&amp;#39;t directly change laws.  But if all of those protests didn&amp;#39;t happen, and if hollywood hadn&amp;#39;t been subliminally but disproportionally injecting homosexuality into TV and Movies, would New Mexico have just legalized gay marriage?  Would people have had enough exposure to homosexuality to understand it and legalize gay marriage? it&amp;#39;s annoying, but it&amp;#39;s gotta happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: Both homosexuality and polyamory should be legalized and accepted by society,"As long as an action doesn't cause harm to anyone else (including society as a whole) or infringe upon someone else's rights, then it is not immoral. Furthermore, a moral action increases happiness and improves the lives of others. For this reason, homosexuality and polygamy should be accepted by society.  Furthermore, even if something can be proven immoral, it still shouldn't be a basis for being made illegal (think lying). Thus, gay marriage and polygamy shouldn't be illegal in countries like the United States, that support individual freedom.     _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

According to it, it would be wrong to apply for a job for which there are several applicants, since your getting this job harms the person who was the second choice. Similarly, a company inventing a product that makes some other company&amp;#39;s product obsolete harms the employees and shareholders of that other company since they can no longer profit from their product. Yes, I would say that taking away somebody&amp;#39;s livelihood constitutes &amp;quot;harming&amp;quot; him by any reasonable definition of this word. The proponent of the ethos &amp;quot;an action is morally acceptable if and only if it doesn&amp;#39;t harm anybody&amp;quot; therefore quickly has to add all kinds of qualifications and exceptions until his whole framework essentially collapses into naive utilitarianism.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Second, the rule is absolutely meaningless without an objective and operational definition of &amp;quot;harm&amp;quot;. For example, many Muslims currently seem to be very hurt by the famous Danish cartoons. Similarly, many Christians feel very hurt about gay marriage, another thing that famously never seems to harm anybody. Of course I can&amp;#39;t see into their brain to measure if these people are really &amp;quot;hurt&amp;quot; or just pretending to be, but based on their externally observable behaviour, I tend to believe them. At this point, the proponent of this ethos can do no better than spin ad hoc explanations why somebody &amp;quot;really isn&amp;#39;t harmed&amp;quot; even though he sincerely feels that he is, or to explain that when you hurt only feelings, it is not really &amp;quot;harming&amp;quot; at all. (Very well, let&amp;#39;s see if you still think this way if I start mocking rape and cancer victims.) Or as seems to be common with these particular examples, argue that harming some people actually isn&amp;#39;t that bad since they don&amp;#39;t really count. For example, Pat Robertson&amp;#39;s feelings and anguish seldom seem to be much concern to anybody.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the rule could be modified so that it says &amp;quot;an action is morally acceptable if and only if it doesn&amp;#39;t cause anybody having justified feelings of harm&amp;quot;. But this is just a sleight of hand that tries to sweep the problems under the word &amp;quot;justified&amp;quot;. Hiding these problems doesn&amp;#39;t make them go away, since people can&amp;#39;t agree at all when somebody&amp;#39;s feelings of being harmed by somebody else&amp;#39;s very existence are justified. We can see this vividly in, for example, the anguish of mom-and-pop stores when Wal-Mart comes to town. (By the way, I think it&amp;#39;s quite funny how the vocal proponents of gay marriage and the vocal opponents of Wal-Mart tend to be the exact same people, who totally reverse their logic of what constitutes &amp;quot;harming others&amp;quot; when they switch between these two tasks.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Third, all our actions have a vast array of direct and indirect consequences that we are not able to track or perceive. The butterfly flapping its wings causing a hurricane and so on. Anything that we do is certainly somehow bound to harm other people. This ethos simply turns ignorance into virtue: as long as you are suitably unaware of the consequences of your actions, you can do anything you want!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyamory and homosexuality are not accepted by society because they are selfish and harmful. Its not a matter of morality. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Take homosexuality for example. If everyone chose to have sex with only same-sex partners, guess how long human society would last... Exactly one generation. There&amp;#39;s nothing immoral about not reproducing... but you can argue that its selfish and that&amp;#39;s why society frowns upon it. These societal feelings  of disgust at homosexuality and polyarmory have developed over time because of the harm they produce in society. (likewise with incest)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Polyamory on the other hand is frowned upon because it creates an unstable family unit and produces children that tend to have limited access to one of their parents. Again, its based on selfishness on the part of one or both parents.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Btw, these same factors are why some religions frown on contraception and why society in general frowns upon single parent families and fathering children out of wedlock&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"I don't believe that ""cop killers"" are any worse than regular killers.

The general media makes people who kill police officers off as way worse people. I don't think that's the case, so, CMV.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is not that police officers have a greater value (if they do is not the question here) the reason is that police officers are more likely to to be killed. For example, if a criminal is being apprehended by the police, if he thinks that it would be possible to escape by killing the officer making the arrest, the chance that he will now be wanted for killing a police officer which comes with a more sever punishment might be enough of a threat to keep him from trying it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police officers work for the protection of other people.

"CMV: In contemporary American society, it is not at all weird to walk down the street while eating a sandwich or similar food item","A few weeks ago, I, a New Yorker, was out at a conference in North Carolina and having a business lunch with two colleagues; one from Montreal and one from Atlanta. We had a lunch of sandwiches and realized we needed to be back at our conference soon for a panel, and so we asked for our food to go. My two compatriots boxed up their lunches and I simply wrapped a napkin around my sandwich and took it to eat while we made our way back to the convention center; prompting my Montrealais friend to comment on how weird it was with my Atlantan friend agreeing with him. This perturbed me, and over the course of the convention I ended up bringing the topic of eating while walking to others there, almost all from the US but none being from my home town of New York, and it seemed to be the consensus was that it was, in fact, weird to eat while walking.  This literally had never dawned on me before. I almost always take my lunches to go in New York and eat it on the sidewalk heading back to the office. Any food that's wrapped in bread (sandwiches, burritos and even slices of pizza) are designed to be eaten without containers or utensils, which make them ergonomically designed for being eaten on the go.

I am against my SO's use of marijuana. CMV,"My SO uses marijuana recreationally and illegally, where we live. He really enjoys the way it makes him feel. The way he describes it is that he is able to have a peaceful mind and enjoy what's around him. He argues that its not harmful. I'm not worried that he's a lazy hedonist,  because he's not. Hes a very motivated,  intelligent guy.  But his use makes me uncomfortable for 2 reasons. One, the lack of legality. The lengths he goes to get weed sometimes is risky, asking a friend of a friend of a friend that he doesn't even know. He lives on a college campus too, so it's posssible to get caught.   Two, I dislike the way it changes him. It makes me uncomfortable that I'm dealing with someone...different than normal. His responsiblities are forgotten and he's out of touch with our relationship and his life. I feel like talking to him while high is a waste of my time. Once he got high on Valebtines Day and goofily asked me to be his valentine, and that was it. Not to sound high maintenance but I love holidays,  I love celebrations,  and I love occasions to express love/appreciation. I feel that being high inhibited him from engaging with me in a more meaningful way or realizing my disappointment over how the day went. He agrees. I just don't get how so many people are fine with their loved ones escaping to a different and motivationless place.  I understand that I can be selfish in relationships. If I'm just being selfish, please show me.  CMV.  Edit: I'm not looking for relationship advice. We are happy together and this isn't a big issue between us. I think that my anti-weed view is unfair to my SO and I was seeking help understanding his perspective.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, people can have drug problems (even with &amp;quot;non-addictive&amp;quot; marijuana). If he spends a large portion of his free time high there may be something to be concerned about, but it doesn&amp;#39;t sound that way to me.  Instead, it sounds very similar to my relationship (I&amp;#39;m him in this scenario ;))&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m happily engaged at the age of 30, and I smoke marijuana.  Sometimes my lovely fiancee will smoke with me, other times she won&amp;#39;t.  When we smoke together, it&amp;#39;s a great experience that can make us closer; we can play, have great conversations, and she &lt;em&gt;loves&lt;/em&gt; sex while high.  When I smoke alone, she treats it as my alone time; I play piano or guitar, video games, or just screw around on reddit.  Marijuana in these times does in fact put me &amp;quot;out of touch,&amp;quot; and that&amp;#39;s the point.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes when I talk, she&amp;#39;s not listening.  Other times when she talks, I&amp;#39;m not listening. It&amp;#39;s true this happens with weed, but it also happens in day to day life.  This is a normal and natural thing in any relationship because alone time, both with and without pot, is very important to the health of our relationship.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think the reason you&amp;#39;re attributing this problem to marijuana is because of the stigma it&amp;#39;s given.  This doesn&amp;#39;t just come from &amp;quot;evil society,&amp;quot; either; it&amp;#39;s easy to feel uncomfortable being sober when others are high (or drunk for that matter) because... well... high people seem pretty stupid from the outside.  I would just suggest that you don&amp;#39;t look at it in terms of weed, but rather in terms of his commitment in effort.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Is he committing a good amount of his energy?  If he were playing video games and not listening well, would that be better?  What if his alone/semialone time was painting airplane models, would that be as upsetting?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think that if you don&amp;#39;t want to smoke and he&amp;#39;s not overdoing it (and if he doesn&amp;#39;t have a regular dealer, I doubt he&amp;#39;s overdoing it), I would sign it off as his own time and find your own fun thing to do.  Even better, try it yourself (give it two or three times, sometimes the first time doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;work&amp;quot;) and you may find that you can share these experiences with him.  If he&amp;#39;s a bright and active person, I bet there&amp;#39;s some awesome shit going on behind that stupid grin, and you&amp;#39;ll be amazed at where your conversations can take you!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a large difference between looking for a partner who does not smoke weed, and demanding that your current partner does not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Personally when I look for a girl to date I try to not date girls who smoke or drink heavily, as our interests will differ. This is not wrong because I simply know what I prefer. To not want to date someone who smokes because it makes you uncomfortable is entirely reasonable for the simple reason that it is illegal. If you look at it from that standpoint it is like not wanting to date someone who does illegal street racing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But to want to change your SO completely is an entirely different thing. Your SO may have a lot of smoking friends, and if he gives up smoking than he is giving up those friends. You are asking him to change an entirely fundamental part of him for you. This is unfair. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Imagine if he said to you that he didn&amp;#39;t want you drinking alcohol? No drinking with your girlfriends or at all. How would you feel? Because to him that is what you are asking. To him it is not sketchy the way he buys it, and he knows how to not get caught. So to him it feels no different than drinking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also the best way to deal with this is to simply make the rule that he cannot be high around you. He can be high with his friends all he wants, but with you he is sober. This compromise should not be to harsh on him, and you don&amp;#39;t have to deal with the affects you don&amp;#39;t like. But you should not attempt to control his life that exists outside of you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: You can't teach men not to rape.,"Before I get burned at the stake, let me set a few facts out.  I'm a dude who subscribes to /r/mensrights and agrees with 60% of the common opinions expressed there.  My stance comes from a viewpoint that lies between the ""women need to look out for themselves"" and ""don't enable rape culture; women should dress and behave as they please"" viewpoints.  I think any person should be able to go where they please and do what they please without worrying about having their personal liberty infringed on.  No one should have to watch their glass like a hawk and their friend's glass and make sure they're not alone and make sure they don't drink too much for fear that someone will take their lowered guard as a chance to sexually assault them.  No one should live in fear of ANYTHING.  It's plain old not healthy.  So, that brings us to ""teach men not to rape!""  While I'm not a rapist, I'm aware that a very very tiny portion of the population are able and willing to force themselves on others by means of drugs or good ol' muscle.  How do you ""teach"" that tiny portion to not rape without demonizing a large portion of the model citizens who are an example of what the solution looks like?

Therefore, educating people as to what rape entails will &amp;quot;teach (some) men not to rape&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for posting. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a seemingly educated and well-informed dude, it may surprise you to know that a lot of men (and to be fair, women) don&amp;#39;t know what rape is, or what qualifies as consent, and some evidence from Edmonton actually &lt;a href=""http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta/2013/01/08/rape-prevention-aimed-at-rapists-does-work/""&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that rape prevention aimed at (potential) rapists &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; work. After launching their &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t Be That Guy&amp;quot; campaign, where they educated men about what constitutes consent, reports of rape fell by 10%. There are also &lt;a href=""http://disruptingdinnerparties.com/2013/03/22/truelovedoesntwait/""&gt;anecdotal&lt;/a&gt; reports of women describing what they considered rape (since they did not consent) but the guy took her absence of a &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to mean &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; without actually getting a consent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As another anecdote/informal survey, I went to a sexual assault awareness skit when I was in college, and the situation was ambiguous enough that the audience (an educated bunch) was split ~50/50 as to whether the girl was raped or not. (She never explicitly said &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; but she never explicitly said &amp;quot;no,&amp;quot; either. They were on a date, she went to his home, they had something like two drinks each, he kissed her, she kissed him back, he took it to the next level, she said afterward things escalated so quickly she didn&amp;#39;t know how to respond, her indecision cost her her window to say no, just laid there and let him finish, but felt violated.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So while there will always be sociopaths, simply educating men (and women) about what constitutes consent (&lt;a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X%2813%2970069-X/fulltext""&gt;because a lot of men don&amp;#39;t know&lt;/a&gt;) could actually prevent a lot of rapes. And maybe you can correct me if I&amp;#39;m missing something, but I don&amp;#39;t see how educating people about where the (sometimes fuzzy) boundary between consent and not consent demonizes anyone. It seems that both men and women (who can each be raped, or accused rapists) could benefit from a clearer understanding of what rape is. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"[CMV] The quality of Apple's products has peaked, is in decline, and will never recover.","In the a the past few years, OSX, iOS, Safari, and iTunes have been getting bloated, buggy, and have started to display UX inconveniences and oversights that would have been virtually unheard of in apple's software in the past.   Their mobile devices have been stagnant because they just keep making different shapes and sizes of iPhone.  The fraction of their revenue that they put into advertising keeps increasing, which means they must be spending less on everything else, like R&amp;D.  The designers of OSX have lost sight of the efficient and intuitive interface design that OSX once strived for, and they are now just changing things at random because they seem neat. (Spaces is gone! why!!?). They are also straying progressively further from it's Unix roots, making it more and more difficult for open source software maintainers.  They've been using cheaper materials (those fucking power cords!) that break after only a year of regular use, probably so they can force you to buy another one.  They have departments within their company that manage systems that are supposed to be intercompatible with the rest of apple products, but are in fact riddled with bugs due to insufficient testing (iCloud). If it's supposed to be your central authentication system, why didn't they re-design the UI flows that are altered by it instead of just hap-hazardly stapling it on and creating a bunch of situations where users are expected to know things they were never told.

CMV: Globalism is killing less developed countries.,"Young, talented people from small countries such as Romania, Poland, Macedonia, Ukraine, Hungary, Thailand, Vietnam, etc. leave the country for more developed nations with higher standard of living. While this does improve their personal lives greatly, said countries are deprived of the brainpower needed to improve. With no capable people in the sphere of science or economics, they cannot develop the system needed to reach the standard of living found in the Nordic Countries, North America or Western Europe.   EDIT: A good reply by /u/JoshuaZ1 [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2zdhff/cmv_globalism_is_killing_less_developed_countries/cphy235) and [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2zdhff/cmv_globalism_is_killing_less_developed_countries/cpi2sqg) ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;With no capable people in the sphere of science or economics, they cannot develop the system needed to reach the standard of living found in the Nordic Countries, North America or Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So brain drain is an issue, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the above is true.  There&amp;#39;s a lot of literature out there about development and growth theory, and it is not as if the governments of those countries cannot solicit advice from economists overseas about good policies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those governments can indeed pursue policies, if they so choose, to help the country develop.  They could put incentives in place to retain people, if brain drain is actually an issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what killing means in this context. They don&amp;#39;t have the standard of living as in more developed countries, but their standard of living is improving as it is for most of the world. The analogy or cliche that is sometimes used is that a rising tide lifts all boats. For example &lt;a href=""http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=ro&amp;amp;v=30""&gt;Romanian life expectancy is steadily improving&lt;/a&gt; and that&amp;#39;s also true for all the other countries in your list (with the possible exception of Ukraine which has other issue). In fact, life expectancy increase in those countries is faster than it is in most of the developed countries, as it gets closer to theirs. Compare for example the data from Romania with &lt;a href=""http://demog.berkeley.edu/%7Eandrew/1918/figure2.html""&gt;the US life expectancy gains in the 1980s and 1990s&lt;/a&gt; and note how Romania&amp;#39;s increase to reach the same level is taking a much shorter time span.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One can tell similar stories about many other metrics of standards of living, such infant mortality levels, internet access, etc. So there may be problems here, but any claim that globalism is &amp;quot;killing&amp;quot; these countries seems very far off, if anything globalism is causing some good and some hard but on balance by the actual measurements is causing much more good than harm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV - I believe human civilization is doomed. *PLEASE* change my view.,"Well, I hate to be a downer, guys, but I don't think humanity has another 100 years left (give or take a few years). I want to believe that things will be alright, but when you keep hearing worse and worse news about the environmental degradation of the planet (even if you are still somehow a climate-change denier, you have to admit the oceans are massively polluted and huge amounts of fish are dying, the air in some parts of the world like China is almost unbreathable and getting worse, etc.), it's hard to see humans coming out of this ok. I hate to say it, but I don't think we have another century left. Please tell me why I'm wrong.  Edit: Just to be clear, I'm not talking about human extinction. We'll probably survive whatever happens to some degree. I mean I think that society will likely collapse. Humans may still be around, but in a Mad Max/The Road/Book of Eli type of existence. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;worse and worse news &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just because the news is getting worse and worse doesn&amp;#39;t mean the world is. Maybe the quality of reporting has gone down, and hyperbole has gone up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;climate-change&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Climate change can be solved. The US DOE calculated that 10,000 square miles of solar panels would be enough to satisfy all of america&amp;#39;s electricity needs. We can &lt;a href=""http://extrememadscience.blogspot.com/2013/11/biochar-buries-fossil.html""&gt;reverse climate change while growing the economy&lt;/a&gt; and make &lt;a href=""http://www.coolplanet.com/newsroom/first-10-million-gallon-refinery""&gt;carbon negative gasoline&lt;/a&gt; in the process.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;None that neither of these requires government intervention. Solar power is now quite cheap and spreading quickly in the third world. Production of gasoline and biochar is looking profitable, and has major oil companies investing in it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;the oceans are massively polluted and huge amounts of fish are dying&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Biochar can reduce eutrophication by holding on to nutrients instead of letting them wash away. Reversing climate change would also reduce ocean acidity at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;the air in some parts of the world like China is almost unbreathable and getting worse&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The air used to be unbreathable in the western world until we decided to do something about it.

CMV:Democracy is the best political system.," I'm not saying that U.S. democracy or any specific democracy is the best or better than any other other government, but rather that democracy, or the idea that every individual should matter and get a say through some kind of vote and that public officials should be held responsible for their actions with that vote is the best political system to date for preventing corruption, and promoting social equality and liberty.  Sure there is a nearly endless list of democracy's shortcomings and failures, and the U.S. is an especially good example of how tyranny and atrocity can continue or even worsen under a supposedly democratic government.  However, I believe these are offset and outnumbered by the tyranny and atrocities committed under non-democratic governments.  When I say this I mean that I believe comparing modern and past democracies to modern and past dictatorships and monarchies throughout history will yield the conclusion that the quality of life in a democracy is substantially better for most people and that as more people are given franchise the better and better it gets.  Conversely if, for example, the U.S. had been a one-party dictatorship for the past 200+ years, atrocities such as chattel slavery, genocide of indigenous peoples, and unwarranted global intervention would be that much worse (if imagining such is even possible.)  I want to clarify that I am using the U.S. as my main example because that's where I am, also I think it is a good example of a particularly controversial example of democracy.  I believe that one of the biggest problems with American democracy to date is the ambivelence people have towards democracy.  Judging even just from the posts on this sub many are incredibly disappointed with democracy and will even go as far as to say it is ""obsolete"" or just a bad idea in the first place.  When we stop having faith in democracy we stop having faith in the people and ourselves and necessarily cede our power to others.    Change my view!  EDIT:  Ok there have been a lot of requests for me to pin things down better and define my view, I'd say it has changed a little since I first posted but here it is:  Democracy is any form of government concerned with the idea of giving more people say, more people equality, more people freedom.   So for example, the U.S. falls short of these things in many ways and at many times but at least it is founded on the premise of expanding the categories that receive citizenship.  At the founding of the U.S. citizenship was incredibly limited but it was still a far larger category of participants than european monarchy.  So Democracy is dynamic and you can have moments in the same system/government/culture that are democratic and un-democratic.    My belief is the idea that the moments that best represent the will of the people are best for governance overall.  EDIT:  Ok so far thank you all for a some interesting debates.  This is my first time as OP on CMV so please forgive my amateurish blunders.  After some contemplation and review I have come to the conclusion that my prompt is too ambiguous, that in order to have a fruitful CMV I need to choose specifically what I am defending.  If that is representative democracy, then so be it.  I may have pulled a bit too much of a ""No true Scotsman"" here.  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would remind you that the purest form of &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot; is anarchy, or complete absence of government. Anarchy is what happens when you give everyone maximum freedom and you give everyone an equal say. What do you get in anarchy? Mainly the strong overpowering the weak.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A purely democratic government (where everything is decided by popular vote) would be almost the same. Instead of the strong overpowering the weak, you have the more numerous overpowering the less numerous. In case you think this would be a good idea, look at some of the great ideas majorities in America have had in the past: racial segregation, eugenics, pure isolationism, etc...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A purely democratic government is also prone to error because the majority is not qualified to determine what&amp;#39;s in the best interests of all people, as the government should do. People are naturally only concerned with protecting their own interests; hence, anarchy causes chaos. The job of the government is to &lt;strong&gt;restrict people&amp;#39;s freedom&lt;/strong&gt; to a point where they cannot infringe on others&amp;#39; freedom. Democracy does the least to accomplish this.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit: My argument was a bit confusing so let me sum it up. Saying that democracy is the most effective form of government implies that people are capable of understanding what is best for the common good and also willing to implement laws to that effect. Many people agree that voters are often not qualified to vote on issues, due to lack of comprehension. If you don&amp;#39;t agree with that statement, there&amp;#39;s also the issue that people are also not willing to act in the common good, as the results of anarchy show.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to argue that democracy is not always the best choice in every situation, in particular the number of times where a democracy fails is very large. In established states or states with little internal tensions democracy functions well - however in highly heterogenous and divided states or states with strong foreign interests it fails: in recent times: libya egypt iraq afghanistan zimbabwe ukraine thailand&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;historically you can consider: the weimar republic any of the french republics in the first 70 years after the revolution the first polish republic&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;a badly set up democracy is often worse than a good dictatorship, and arguably Franco and Pinochet were better off for their countries at the time than the free choice of the people . Likewise right now in Syria a democracy could well entrench IS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So basically while I think a well-planned democracy is most often the best, sometimes stability is a better option and often a poorly constructed democracy is worse than the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
Steal from the Rich and give to the Poor. CMV,"   Exactly as it states in the title I hold a view akin to Robin Hood. I Just spent hours arguing with my twin about this view. The hypothetical situation I gave to him was this: There is an 99 year old man who just died in his sleep. He had 2 cars. One that he never used, didn't even drive it off the lot himself, and one that he used daily. Would it not be right for a poor family to come in and take this rich man's car, the one that was never used, in the middle of the night?     A few Caveats: The rich old man had no heirs, No will/testament, absolutely no living person in his lineage except him, he died a lonely bachelor and had no security, dog, etc. I just feel that the poor family who could never afford a car would benefit far greater from it than that old selfish man! Please Reddit I'm pretty distraught and can not see how I would be wrong...so CMV.  Edit: To clarify a few things I do not support stealing money, or things still in use everyday. However there is a ""hoarder"" culture and the rich(along with the poor yes) have far too much that can be taken and used for good things!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few Caveats: The rich old man had no heirs, No will/testament, absolutely no living person in his lineage except him, he died a lonely bachelor and had no security, dog, etc. I just feel that the poor family who could never afford a car would benefit far greater from it than that old selfish man!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this incredibly specific, rather unrealistic set of circumstances, sure, I wouldn&amp;#39;t hold it against them. But how likely is this situation?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s go with a more likely scenario and say a poor person stole from a living rich person. What if that rich person was going to invest that money in a company and employ people? What if he was going to give it to charity? What if he was going to use it to create a foundation to end homelessness and poverty? And what if the poor person was going to spend it on drugs?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If wealth is being transferred from rich to poor through means of theft and crime, there is no accountability to make sure that money gets used for anything of worth or will be put back into the economy in meaningful way. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be the first person to admit that inequality of wealth is a huge problem in our society. I always advocate for legal means of leveling the playing field, but I would never try and justify stealing to accomplish those goals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does that poor family deserve the car more than the other poor families? Is it because they happened to be in the right place at the right time, and were willing to break the law? Should we reward people who take advantage of dead/old people?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;IMO the more fair option would be for the city/gov&amp;#39;t to sell off that car (and the rest of his belongings, since he doesn&amp;#39;t have an heir/will), and then add the money to social welfare funds for the poor. By doing so, (hypothetically) we help the poor out more by distributing the funds rather than letting one family take it all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: I don't want to vote in the upcoming UK General Election,"I have voted in every single UK General Election since I became old enough to legally do so. Even when I moved abroad for study, I voted. I was a firm believer that, being fortunate enough to live in a ""democracy"" where one can vote, we have a duty to do so.  Fuck that.  I'm tired of politicians and the bullshit that spews forth from their lying, deceitful gums. I'm tired of the Tories, I'm tired of the Lib Dems, I'm tired of Labour, I'm tired of the Greens, I'm tired of UKIP. It's all bullshit and they're all bullshitters. The Green Party and UKIP are mostly straight-shooters, but their policies leave a lot to be desired. Politics is for the parties, not the people.  I was at a local council meeting yesterday - a Lib Dem stronghold - where they proposed an increase in councillor allowances. Over the last year rent, parking, and taxes have all increased throughout the borough. The Conservative opposition opposed the blanket increase saying that most of the councillors could comfortably afford to live without a rise in allowance. They thought it better to put the taxpayer's money that would fund the increased allowance back into the community. The conservatives were outvoted by something on the order of 50-6. There are 50 Lib Dem councillors and 6 Conservative councillors. That isn't democracy. Unless you were present at the meeting, the borough's residents wouldn't have even known about this increase. This is a microcosm of national politics.  And this is just one example of many. There are member's of parties being suspended for going against party lines, even though they're sticking up for their constituents! That is what politicians should be doing!  Anyway, I won't continue muchlonger. I live in a Labour stronghold and I have two options: vote for Labour, because they'll win anyway, or waste a vote on another party. Do the majority of votes actually have any implication in this election anyway? The ""first past the post"" is flawed. Look at the popular vote/seats percentages for the last election:  Party|Votes|Seats --|--|-- Conservatives|10.8 M (36.4%)|306 (47.1%) Labour|8.6M (29%)|258 (39.7%) Liberal Democrats|6.8M (23%)|57 (8.8%)  How, when 23% of the voters chose one party, did they get just fewer than 9% of the seats? How is that a reflection of the people.   Party|One Seat|Votes Needed --|--|-- Labour|1|33,370 Conservatives|1|35,313 Liberal Democrats|1|119,944  It's beyond a joke.  I'm tired of politics and politicians and, as such, I won't be voting in this General Election. I want to, so desperately, but don't see any point in doing so...  My vote means fuck all. Yeah, no rain drop thinks it's responsible for the flood and all that jazz. But you need hundreds of sandbags to stop it, and I'm just a grain.

CMV: You owe taxes starting from your first moment of existence; they are a debt you are morally obliged to pay.,"Modern society is comparable to an all-you-can-eat buffet. You being born in a first-world country is comparable to you gaining access to this buffet because someone lends you the entrance fee. If you refuse to pay taxes, it means that you don't want to pay this entrance fee back.   ""But I am not even eating right now!"". Doesn't matter, you can if you want to. I don't think you are going to refuse emergency services, firemen, or FEMA aid if you are about to need their services. Government is acting as an agent of society to make you pay back what was given to you. You have to acknowledge this debt.  Agreement to anything doesn't play a role. You didn't agree to getting born, nor to dying later on either. Or getting sick, or in an accident.  Your parents decided to sign you up for this buffet. They could have emigrated to Somalia or any other failed state, and you would now enjoy a tax-free life. Or, to stay within the example, to not opt for the buffet.   Instead, they chose to pay the entrance fee with a loan in your name. Remember, it's your debt. It's incurred for the potential options, not for the actual eating. You are already in the room, any action whatsoever won't change that. You can refuse to contribute, simply by not earning anything. This doesn't change that you have a debt which you still are responsible for paying. If you don't, you are dodging your debt and your responsibility.  If you make a million $ and pay $330,000 of taxes, it's not that someone took your hard-earned money away. Compare with a no-tax situation in a failed state, where you live in a hut in the wilderness. Without all the support you have now and take for granted, you would be able to make maybe $10 / day as the smartest guy, when all others around make $1 / day.   Not unrealistic for failed states where you don't have to pay taxes. Remember, clay huts with a well. You were able to make an additional $999,700 *only* because you are in the US and not in Somalia. Society is your dormant partner in this business venture and supplied the infrastructure, for this they demand $1 for every $3 you make. Sounds fair, and you need to recognize this partnership.  It's an investment in you from your dormant partner, society, which made all you can achieve possible. Taxes are the payout to your dormant partner, and government acts as a proxy to collect this debt. The debt originates from society. It builds with the generations.  This is way it's justified to tax, and why I feel good doing so. This enables our successors to do the same.

It&amp;#39;s a contract you were forced into at birth.  So my personal perspective on that is, you know, if the anarcho-capitalists want to build their own little non-state off in the nevada desert or the yukon wilderness or something, maybe we should just let them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;we&amp;#39;ll need to enforce that border of course, and when a guy comes up to it and says &amp;quot;hey i need help, a loan shark broke both my arms when I couldn&amp;#39;t pay back the debt i took out to pay for my daughter to get into elementary school and no hospital will set and cast them for me because I can&amp;#39;t prove I can pay the bill&amp;quot; we&amp;#39;ll need someone with the fortitude to turn that person away(not me).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the analogies, what you&amp;#39;re describing could apply to those living in North Korea.

I feel that the majority of arguments offered by people on CMV and any forum of debate in general exist in an imaginary abstract space with little application to the real world and are thus mostly a waste of time. CMV.,"This feeling has occurred to me as a result of my participation in another thread here today. It will be easiest for me to explain what I mean by making reference to a couple of the arguments posted there.  &gt;I feel if that was the case, the 90% should get bitchslapped upside the head with some knowledge. I don't think we should necessarily punish the ignorant, but we shouldn't indulge it either.  (^ This was in response to the fact that over 90% of pollees support mandatory GMO labeling.)  &gt;This ""freedom of determination"" that you speak of is exactly what's wrong with the world, if we have to restrict the information of GM food so that people will eat them, so be it. Your ""freedom of determination"" will always lead to long term negative impacts.  These two posts display pretty clearly what I am driving at. In the real world, things are the way they are because *that's what works*. It is my experience that any time I find myself getting involved in political discussions, people get caught up in their argument without actually going into or even considering how that argument might be enacted or applied in the real world.  A fine example of this is the entire Occupy Wall Street movement. The core statement of that entire movement was basically, ""Things are this way, but they **SHOULD** be *that* way--so we're gonna sit around until they are.""  ""Should"" is the bane of meaningful discussion. Anytime someone says things ""should"" be a certain way, in your head you can replace the word with ""can"", and you quickly find that the statement is false. Yeah, great, everyone *should* have all their basic needs met, everyone *should* be fed and healthy and happy. But not everyone *can* be, because there is no **working** way fathomable to get there and sustain it. Until there is, until you actually have that method and system figured out, it is completely useless to bring it up at all.  The two posts I quoted above show a shocking failure to understand actual reality, because if you try to imagine either as being actually implemented in the real world, you can only get there by eradicating democracy and leaving decisions up to a select group, ***and that has never worked out in all of history***. You can't have everything be democratic except this one decision, or that one decision. It's all or nothing. Therefore, bringing up **anything** that isn't ""90% of the people want it and so they must have it"" requires you to put an oligarchy in place. Just because the thing 90% of people want might be negative doesn't mean the alternative is better. You *have* to accept the bad with the good, because that's the real world, that's what democracy is, and that's the only way things *work*.  Am I making my point clear?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except in reality there are dozens or hundreds of variants of things that could work. Without the discussion of what &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; how can we distinguish between the various choices and pick the one that works best for us?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Occupy people weren&amp;#39;t unified by a core statement of anything. They were just mad at things. Any time they tried to come up with a plan or something practical they fractured their own base of support. They never even had a &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; to begin with, they only had a &amp;quot;should not&amp;quot;. Things should not be like this, they said, but they couldn&amp;#39;t even agree amongst themselves about what the problem was or how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would argue that the unworkable ideal is an essential foundation for practical action, because it articulates the real goals of a person or group. Without that understanding, you&amp;#39;re going to find it hard or impossible to get people in general lined up and working together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I agree with some of your overall criticisms of the flaws in the present system, my underlying objection varies in foundation and as such I can only offer to extrapolate on that delineation rather than fight for/against the majority of your proposal.    &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What compelled me to reply, however, was this statement:    &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Within the context of expected reason (it is unreasonable to request all people be all happy all the time, and as such the request is not eligible to be considered rational or taken seriously- however, a normal and expected amount of unhappiness as part of a normal life can co-exist with the ideal of maximizing cultural happiness and health and that is a rational request)-    &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, great, everyone should have all their basic needs met, everyone should be fed and healthy and happy. But not everyone can be, because there is no working way fathomable to get there and sustain it.         &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is blatantly and patently untrue and promoting the notion that such concepts and societal structures are impossibilities is misguided at best.     &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps a middle ground might be met by clarifying the divide between &lt;em&gt;ideals&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;realities&lt;/em&gt;, which is what I believe you may be trying to elucidate- that proposing ideals can be treated no different than realities is an unworkable strategy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: I'm not sold on the concept of 'genderfluid', and I think it demeans transgender people","Let me be clear, I would never discriminate against someone who identifies as genderfluid or treat them worse than anyone else. I can't deny that I have some internal eye-rolling when I see the term thrown around though.   It seems to me that identifying as genderfluid stems from a failure to separate gender identity from gender roles. For example, someone is male-bodied and doesn't experience dysphoria, but they play with dolls or like the color pink. This doesn't mean that they're some sort of boy/girl mix; it just means they're a boy who likes dolls. To suggest that men can't perform female gender roles without becoming part girl seems like 1950's type of thinking. When they play with trucks the next day, they haven't turned back into a man, they're just a guy who likes dolls and trucks.  Now as to why I think this is an issue for trans people. One of the major struggles the trans community faces is getting people to understand that they were born in the ""wrong"" body. It isn't an act they're putting on, and it isn't a choice they made. When a genderfluid person comes in and says ""I'm feeling a little feminine, I guess I'm a woman today."" it gives ammunition to the opposition.   Finally, I'll admit some ignorance here because I don't personally know anyone who identifies as genderfluid/genderqueer. Do genderfluid people experience dysphoria when their gender-of-the-day doesn't match their physical sex? If anyone is trans and willing to share, I would also be interested to hear your opinions on this. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It practically wiped out my depression my brain had and I began to feel better almost immediately. I thought this would last but no, the opposite became true emotions were felt too deeply, a sense of loss in my sexual organs occured. I stopped HRT for a couple of weeks and fascinated myself in having working male organs and male &amp;#39;thoughts&amp;#39; (Yes hormones change the way you think). I was somewhere inbetween, I found it was best i cycled my HRT (closely monitored by my doctor) to when my head needed it. Sometimes i need natural testosterone, sometimes I need estrogen and I can instinctively feel when I need either of them. Gender fluid should not be confused with stereotypical gender roles, for me its simply trying to avoid dysphoria whenever my brain wants to make the switch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess I fall somewhere into that category, so I&amp;#39;ll give my response:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was born male, but knew from about age 6 that I wanted to be a girl. I repressed it a long time and struggled with it right up to my late 20s. If I could just press a button and immediately become cis-female I would definitely do so without hesitation, but since I can&amp;#39;t, I&amp;#39;ve struggled a lot with how exactly to manage my life. I look in the mirror and I see a 6-foot tall guy with broad shoulders and a prominent jaw-line and I just know that I&amp;#39;m never going to pass, and I think &amp;quot;well... shit. I&amp;#39;m not male and I&amp;#39;m not female, so what the hell am I supposed to do with that?&amp;quot; the only solution I&amp;#39;ve been able to come up with is something like what I guess would be called &amp;quot;gender fluid&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People who are close to me get to know the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; me: I try the best I can to express my feminine side without being ostentatious, and without drawing too much attention to myself because I really just want to blend in. But going around in all-out female mode is inevitably going to draw attention and make me (and my gender) the centre of every conversation which I&amp;#39;d really rather not be. So I pick female pants rather than skirts, cashmere sweaters rather than blouses, etc. and just generally try to be gender &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot; -it&amp;#39;s the closest I can get to being comfortable and happy with myself without feeling like I&amp;#39;m puttting on an act.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I understand that by not transitioning completely I&amp;#39;m putting some people in an uncomfortable position of not knowing how to relate to me, and that&amp;#39;s unfortunate, but at the same time... well, it&amp;#39;s my life, and I don&amp;#39;t feel like I owe it to anyone to have surgery or modify my body for validation. On top of that, over the years I&amp;#39;ve conditioned myself to a lot of male activities that I don&amp;#39;t feel I should have to give up. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I, of course, recognize that there are many others for whom being &amp;quot;fluid&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t enough and for whom complete transition is a real necessity and I&amp;#39;ll always offer whatever kind of support and solidarity I can to people in that position, but for me personally, gender-fluid is just the least-bad solution I&amp;#39;ve been able to find to a problem that I&amp;#39;ve struggled with for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Does that make any sense?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0

"I believe that ""grammar nazis"" are limiting the development and evolution of Language. CMV","By confining our language to definition term of words created hundreds of years ago, I believe we are slowing down the progress of language. I believe language will follow the same path as everything else in this world and become globalized. I hope all previous languages are not lost, but we will evolve and develop a universal language eventually. By constantly enforcing rules of American grammar onto a World wide socializing site, I truly believe ""grammar nazis"" are hindering language growth. Now I admit, there are terms and words used completely wrong and really do not make sense when thought about. Here is an example of, what I consider, a grammar nazi debilitating language:  Up most is properly used in sentence. Grammar nazi corrects op with utmost*.  Both are dictionary correct terms, meaning almost the same thing. Utmost came first, derived from common words of long ago(old word). Up most is more modern, and has a derivative term that is common for today(new phrase). Today, up is a common word and most is a common word. The origins of this term can be understood and grasped by a foreign speaker. Utmost comes from utmest, which comes from ūtmest, which comes from ūt out. This is hard to follow for even a native English speaker.  Source:Merriam-Webster dictionary  I believe the attachment to old words, phrases, and rules is slowing down our growth towards a global language. CMV","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;While grammar nazis may disagree with changing cultural language trends, (literally used as figuratively) most correction in forums like Reddit are done for individual misuse or misspellings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Correcting someone&amp;#39;s use of &amp;quot;up most&amp;quot; as opposed to &amp;quot;utmost&amp;quot; is not to prevent some shift in public usage, it&amp;#39;s done because that person most likely does not know the correct tem. &amp;quot;Up most&amp;quot; is also spelled incorrectly, in either case and was most likely used because the person has never seen the word &amp;quot;utmost&amp;quot; written. This is due to lack of knowledge instead of intentionally different wording.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, clarity while speaking or writing is important. Rampant misuse of terms and spelling leads to ambiguous interpretation and discerning intent becomes mushy and imprecise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Attempting to correct a public language shift is futile. Personally, I would prefer if the usage of &amp;quot;more&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;as many as&amp;quot; was clarified. &amp;quot;Four time more apples&amp;quot; should not be the same number as &amp;quot;four times as many apples&amp;quot; however it&amp;#39;s pointless to argue against how the phrase is commonly used.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I do not think that grammar nazism has had a significant effect on cultural phrasing or spelling in general, which is what you seem to suggest. Grammar nazis are generally not purchasing commercial space on prime time TV to sway public opinion. Instead, they are attempting to correct misconceptions on individual usage or spelling.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In summary, I disagree with you entirely and I believe that the English language will continue to evolve independently and unimpeded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP, while I agree with your apparent opinion of grammar nazis, I disagree with your statement that they&amp;#39;re limiting the natural progression of language.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think they&amp;#39;re powerless.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite all the grammar nazism (in English), &amp;#39;whom&amp;#39; is almost gone, the past participle is going away, and a wide variety of other thinks are changing.  This is because grammar nazis (at least on reddit) are obsessed with correcting people&amp;#39;s misuse of homophones (a spelling error, rather than a grammatical one), and most people&amp;#39;s primary interaction with their language is spoken, rather than textual, in which these errors do not occur.  Collective inertia towards innovation is the rule of law, and the acts of a few curmudgeons won&amp;#39;t really make much of a dent in it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can jail the revolutionary, but you can&amp;#39;t jail the revolution.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit: I also disagree with your assertion that the world will move towards a single language.

"I think networking (think business, not computers) is corruption. CMV","I spent a lot of time in the business school as an undergrad and they put a huge emphasis on networking with people to land jobs and internships. I don't see why this is morally acceptable. Obviously there is a level of practicality to some networking- its sometimes better to hire someone you know than someone you don't. But for the most part, its not about practicality, but scratching each others backs. Networking results in the best candidate getting turned away because someone else has a connection. Shouldn't job/internship/school placement be based on merit? We call it corruption when people obtain political appointments based on who they know, why is it ok to encourage this same practice in the business world?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all how do you judge merit?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In college you&amp;#39;re taught that your GPA is basically your worth but the fact is, a GPA is only an indicator and a somewhat flawed one at that. In terms of hiring, a 3.9 gpa is the same as a 3.8 even though the difference between the two might be huge academically.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, academic indications like GPA and school placement are only measures of your technical performance. In most jobs, your technical performance and smarts are only half the battle. Social skills, ability to work in groups, and etc are also vital to a firms efficiency and productivity. Networking and the interview is an imperfect but the only feasible indicator of your social skills. A person who is more able to network would most likely have better social skills. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, i want to really elaborate on my first point. Someone with a 3.9 gpa would probably have work around the exactly same quality as someone with a 3.8 gpa.  However, if the 3.8 gpa has networked and knows the recruiter and has made a favorable impression on him, he has also mitigated the risk in the recruiter&amp;#39;s mind of possibly being a person who he wouldnt want to work with &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define &amp;quot;merit&amp;quot;. How am I supposed to know which of the three hundred identical applications has merit? The fact of the mater is I, as an employer, do not know who you are. I am thoroughly unqualified to judge who you are before I hit the interview process, and I cannot possibly interview everyone every time. So, when I already know someone who suits the position, I can save everyone time and energy by just informing that person. I guess that&amp;#39;s the practicality element you were talking about.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, the difference between preferential treatment in government and a company is that it&amp;#39;s the people&amp;#39;s money, not the government&amp;#39;s. If I asked applicants to spend money to apply for a job, and then don&amp;#39;t consider them for said job then that&amp;#39;s wrong. The government has already collected taxes from all applicants, to do so and then ignore the application is wrong. Companies don&amp;#39;t do the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, when you have a single family or group of families that have all the positions in government, then the government gradually ceases to serve the interests of the people governed and begins to serve the interests of just those families. After all, why should they care if the only people that matter are in their in group? Companies are interested in profit. That&amp;#39;s part of the definition of corporation, in fact. Who cares if people are interested in making money because their family benefits or making money because society benefits? The point is making money, and it all lines up. The problem is if they don&amp;#39;t fire people who hinder the company, but that&amp;#39;s a separate issue from hiring people they know.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would say that if it was possible to pick the best candidate the majority of the time based on only the application process then it would be unjust to do anything else. But if that were the case then the company would just do that, again because they have the profit motive and the knowledge to do so. Absent these things, it is reasonable that people default to cheaper and easier compromises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Consciousness is eternal. Every conscious being will become a god of their universe.,"1. Matter or Energy cannot be destroyed or created. 2. Prevailing theories about the ultimate fate of the universe(Big Freeze or Big Crunch) include another formation of the big bang. That means possibly an endless destruction and formation of universes. 3. Consciousness is just the 'continuation' of one state of bio-molecular arrangement to the next closest state of bio-molecular arrangement, with time as a factor.    Therefore, given infinite time and finite matter or energy, one's consciousness is infinite. As long as the atoms/matter that you were with during your last conscious moments exists, an event that reconstructs your brain will eventually arrive regardless of the improbability. ""Time is infinite"" because of the endless Big Bang events, utilizing the same energy, and eventually the same conditions, including time and the specific atoms, that allow for your revival. This may be in the same universe but in an extremely distant time or in a different universe but with a twist to the fate of your nonexistence.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you took two people, and started to replace their cells one-for-one, at what point do you stop being yourself and start becoming them? What really makes an object itself? Is a clone of you it&amp;#39;s own person, or an exact twin, and does that mean you are  more than the sum of your parts?

"CMV: I am going on Birthright soon, and I don't think I should boycott Israel.","I am going on a Birthright trip soon, and I am feeling very conflicted about going. I am pretty liberal in most ways, but I don't understand a whole lot about international politics, although I try. Obviously, I've been hearing a lot about the conflict on the West Bank, because I don't completely live under a rock. While I think that Israel does what it has to do a lot of the time, and I do think that liberal media often misrepresents Israel, I do not approve of the settlements. Some of my more educated liberal acquaintances are advocating a boycott of Israeli products and companies. They do not know I am going to go on this trip, and I am embarrassed to tell them. Is it wrong for me to go on the trip? I don't want to cancel, because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to see Israel and meet some interesting new people. But oh, the guilt. Guide me?

You may be against what Israel is doing, and that&amp;#39;s fine, several of the people on my trip were, but you are getting offered a free trip.

"CMV: The ""you should spend x months salary on a wedding ring"" idea is morally reprehensible and financially irresponsible in every single case.","I can't STAND people who talk about this sort of thing. The idea that you should spend half or more of a yearly income on a wedding ring is the most disgusting financial advice I have ever heard.  I absolutely believe how much you spend on your wedding ring ought to be proportional to how much you earn. But this is for the opposite reason. If you are making median wage, you should be aiming for a nice several hundred dollar ring. If you are earning six figures, that's when you get into thousand dollar+ rings.   I do not believe anybody should be spending relatively huge quantities of money on wedding rings, particularly diamonds, since by now we all know how disgusting the entire diamond industry is.  While we're at it, separate engagement rings are even worse.  CMV _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I have only heard 2-3 months of income and it usually refers to both rings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2 months of income really isn&amp;#39;t that much money for single people near the median household income. (We&amp;#39;re talking after tax dollars of course)  It shows that you are responsible with your money and able to save up to afford nice things.  I just got an engagement and wedding ring and I dropped between 2 and 3 months of income on it.  Was it financially irresponsible?  Not in the least.  I saved up about 9 months for it, taking about 20% of my income and throwing it into a savings account.  I make right at the median income and as a single person I had more than enough to put 20% to whatever I wanted.  The 2 years before I started saving for the ring I was putting that money into a different savings account so I could have 6 months of an Emergency Fund.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bottom Line: It isn&amp;#39;t irresponsible at all putting 2 months salary into a single thing.  People buy brand new cars on credit that are nearly a full years salary and think it&amp;#39;s fine, so why is 2 months on a ring that will last your entire life (regardless of if you get divorced or not) be a bad thing?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, buying a ring on credit is another story.  But that&amp;#39;s not what we are talking about here.

If was do that, then I would be paying more for my ring then I will pay for my entire wedding. I really don&amp;#39;t think that is all what most people do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As per the ring, the experience after engagement is completely different for a woman than it is for man. After I got engaged, other then my FB profile, nothing really changed. For the girl, it means that she will be showing off that ring to everyone and I mean everyone to the person who does her nails, to her best friends to her boss. If, in an attempt to save money I got her a cheap ring it could easily reflect poorly on me. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Buy whatever ring you as a couple want, but make sure you will proud when she shows it to her boss or your boss or her parents. You don&amp;#39;t want to be known as the guy who bought my daughter a really cheap ring.

"I've never had one sip of alcohol, and I don't have any interest in ever trying it. CMV, please!","I'm 20 years old, and in 5 months I turn 21 (I'm in America, for what it's worth). I'm actually sort of dreading the thought of my 21st birthday, to be honest. I know that if I do celebrate it with friends, there's going to be this stigma and expectation that I'm going to drink a bunch of alcohol. If I don't, I know [I'm going to be asked why a bunch of times](http://www.comedycentral.com/video-clips/fq3bvp/comedy-central-presents-people-who-don-t-drink) (skip to 0:55).  So why don't I drink? Well, because I'm really quite terrified of the stuff, to be honest. Why? For starters, I have a long line of alcoholism that runs in both sides of my family. My dad was an abusive alcoholic, and he is actually gone from my life now, since he left me and my mother and brother. Ironically though, as a side note, I don't think I've ever seen him drunk - because he was 5'9"", 280-300 lbs, and he had been a heavy drinker for his whole life, and he has alcoholism in his blood as well. So this man could throw back some alcohol, and while I won't go into details, I definitely have some negative memories associated with it.  The thing that gets me with him is that my grandfather was also an abusive alcoholic to my father. I've never met this grandfather (he died before I was born), but my mom has, and she swears that those two men were exact carbon copies of each other. My father occasionally told me some of his childhood stories, and he said he hated what his dad did to him, and he vowed to do better than my grandfather. So he basically said the exact same things that I'm saying, but he still ended up going down the same road as his father. I don't think I'm destined to become like him, but it does scare me sometimes to see how similar he and I really are, in many different ways.  But it's not just my dad either. I can't even count the number of people that I've known, or friends/family members have known that have done stupid things while under the influence. What gets me the most is that I've met many of these people. And I know that they are good people, deep down. There are so many good people that do bad things while under the influence. I refuse to be that way. My mom has been an ICU nurse for longer than I've been alive, and she very frequently sees patients who are almost dead, because of something alcohol-related; she's seen many of them die, too. And not only that, but she also sees the family members there with them, and they are just devastated and distraught over losing a loved one. I could never, ever live with myself (even in an afterlife), if that patient was me, and I destroyed my family and friends like that. Or if I ever was an abusive alcoholic father, like my own.  But, of course, not everyone is like that, and most people can be reasonable about it. But I wonder if that is even possible for me, to be like most people. I can definitely tell that I have the addictive personality. I used to be addicted to sodas and caffeinated drinks for years, before I finally kicked them. It was the same with fapping too. And for both of those things, there were various times in my life when I had made it several days/weeks/months without them. But all it took was one time, and I would relapse again. But fortunately, I've kicked those addictions again!  Another thing about me is that I'm on the autistic spectrum (high-functioning autism or Asperger's, depending on who you ask). I've definitely come a very long way since I was younger, especially with socializing and being friendly to people and being open-minded, etc. My current girlfriend drinks relatively frequently, and it doesn't really bother me very much (but it does sometimes, mainly when she is with her friends and they drive afterwards [even if it's only 1-2 drinks]). She's even drank with me there before, several times, and it's been okay. My ex-girlfriend only drank in front of me once, and it made me very uncomfortable - so she just hid it and lied about it.  The problem I have is that I'm not big into the bar scene or party scene, because I'm a bit sensitive to big crowds and loud noises, because of the autism stuff. I just don't understand the purpose of it. The idea of voluntarily giving up control of your mind, just to relieve stress - that's very confusing to me. I don't foresee myself being able to ever do that. I would rather control my own mind, and relieve my stress myself, without the aid of a depressant.  Also, I just don't understand why it's necessary. I've come so far with my autism stuff, to the point where I can go out to parties and have lots of fun with people, even while being completely sober. I don't understand what alcohol provides, that you can't get elsewhere. Yes, it gives you a buzz, and lowers your inhibitions, and can make you friendlier and happier (assuming you're a happy drunk, and not an angry bar fight drunk, like my dad). But I can have lowered inhibitions and be happier and friendlier myself, simply by just not giving a fuck. I don't understand why alcohol is necessary for this.  Also, depending on the alcohol, there's lots of it that doesn't taste good, from what I've been told. My girlfriend told me that it's an ""acquired taste"", and that she really hated the taste of her first few beers, and it took her quite a while to drink one that she genuinely enjoyed the taste of. Why would you do that to yourself - drink something that tastes bad for so long, something with so many carbs and empty calories, and no health benefits (other than some wines)? It's also quite an expensive hobby as well, and I'm a poor college student. Why? Because I'm coming from a single parent household, thanks to my alcoholic dad, and working two jobs while being a full-time student isn't enough.  I want my view to be changed, because I'm tired of being an outcast.  I have not met a single person in my life who has ever felt the same way as me. Even the smartest, brightest, and most charismatic people, will still go out and drink on occasion. So I know the problem lies with me. I just can't ever seem to get over myself. I feel like there's an enormous social pressure on me because of this, and I'll see this even more in a few months on my 21st birthday.  Also, my girlfriend really enjoys drinking (especially beer/wine tastings), and her friends do too. So any time they want to go drink, it's immediately a conflict of interest for her, and I don't want our relationship to be strained because of me. She has been VERY supportive and understanding and encouraging, and I love that so much. But if it's something that she really enjoys doing, and it's something that brings her closer to her friends, then I don't want to be left out of it. And I don't want her (or them) to feel guilty or anything like that. So I want to want to drink, but I don't want to drink. I'm painfully closed-minded, but I'm working on it. Is there any hope for me? What are your thoughts on this? Thank you so much for reading all of this, I greatly appreciate it! Looking forward to seeing the responses!  **tl;dr - I have never tried a sip of alcohol, and have no interest in doing so, because of an abusive alcoholic father, long lines of alcoholism/addictive personalities in both sides of my family, expenses, bad taste, and because I don't believe that it gives you anything that you can't get while being sober. But I want to fit in with everyone else, and stop being an outcast, without compromising my values**","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have never tried a sip of alcohol, and have no interest in doing so, because of an abusive alcoholic father, long lines of alcoholism/addictive personalities in both sides of my family, expenses&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are all very good reasons to be wary of alcohol, and honestly I&amp;#39;m not sure I would recommend you ever start drinking. That having been said, as someone who didn&amp;#39;t drink until they were 21 and had a healthy fear of alcohol, these points:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;bad taste, and because I don&amp;#39;t believe that it gives you anything that you can&amp;#39;t get while being sober.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Are pretty universally thought of as false. Alcoholic drinks are generally an acquired taste, and I don&amp;#39;t mean &amp;quot;they suck but you get drunk&amp;quot;, I mean that over time you will dislike or tolerate them at first, but end up liking them. You could think of them similarly to things like broccoli or asparagus, where many people dislike them at first but grow to like them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The second one is even more obviously false, one of the major things you get when drinking that you don&amp;#39;t while sober is lowered inhibitions and (usually) more social confidence. There is a reason that a &amp;quot;buzz&amp;quot; is mentioned by those who drink, because your body does get a pleasurable feeling from being at a certain level of intoxication. You mention these yourself, but saying things like:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I can have lowered inhibitions and be happier and friendlier myself, simply by just not giving a fuck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;don&amp;#39;t make them true. You can certainly become as happy/friendly/uninhibited as you want without alcohol, but it does have effects that differ from what being sober is.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Neither of these are, in my view, things you &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; to have, and if you have a history of alcoholism I would be very careful. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I want my view to be changed, because I&amp;#39;m tired of being an outcast. I have not met a single person in my life who has ever felt the same way as me. Even the smartest, brightest, and most charismatic people, will still go out and drink on occasion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is untrue, there are and have been many people who have not drank for a variety of reasons. Yours is actually the most common: Fear of alcoholism. Unfortunately for most of your peers this is not something they have experienced first hand (lacking abusive alcoholics in their family) and so they will not be able to empathize with you especially well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#39;t ever seem to get over myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is crazy, you shouldn&amp;#39;t be forced to &amp;quot;get over&amp;quot; maybe becoming an alcoholic. If you do choose to drink in your future I would strive to alert those around (friends/family) to the possibility and to prepare them to help you if it becomes a problem. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, my girlfriend really enjoys drinking (especially beer/wine tastings), and her friends do too. So any time they want to go drink, it&amp;#39;s immediately a conflict of interest for her, and I don&amp;#39;t want our relationship to be strained because of me. She has been VERY supportive and understanding and encouraging, and I love that so much. But if it&amp;#39;s something that she really enjoys doing, and it&amp;#39;s something that brings her closer to her friends, then I don&amp;#39;t want to be left out of it. And I don&amp;#39;t want her (or them) to feel guilty or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To be blunt: This may become an issue, and if you never drink you may or may not be able to be with someone who does regularly. You should mostly think of it like a hobby that they all share and enjoy, which you do not. Is you not sharing that hobby with them too much a social issue? It may be, but that just means that you two aren&amp;#39;t right together.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m painfully closed-minded, but I&amp;#39;m working on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You are not close minded, you are scared. There is a big difference. I was very worried that when I started drinking at 21 I would lose control of myself and do things that were, well, crazy. I&amp;#39;ve been pretty lucky that I haven&amp;#39;t had this issue. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is there any hope for me? What are your thoughts on this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is hope for you, both that you could introduce alcohol slowly and be safe and not an alcoholic, and there is hope that you decide not to ever drink, and you own this decision and make it clear to others that it is not up for negotiation. My thoughts on this are to proceed carefully, but not to think that anything you are doing or going through is either unusual or rash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the only real argument you&amp;#39;re making is one from fear; you&amp;#39;re concerned that if you enjoy alcohol, you&amp;#39;ll abuse it. This is a legitimate concern, and one that you&amp;#39;ll have to engage with if you decide to give drinking a go-round. I think the rest is just further post-hoc justification or preference; expense, taste, viewing it as unnecessary, etc. all come from your &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; inexperience, not a well-explored retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many worthwhile activities or experiences don&amp;#39;t hold up well without direct experience of them. Hiking a mountain sounds stupid until you stand on the summit and survey the world from a new perspective. Sailing sounds boring until you have a sail full of wind, a rope in one hand and a tiller in the other; in that moment, there&amp;#39;s not many better things universe. Most experiences can&amp;#39;t be called unnecessary, or foul, or expensive &lt;em&gt;until&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#39;ve given them a try.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Almost any worthwhile pleasure is potentially dangerous taken to extremes: food, drink, too much sleep, too little sleep, driving too fast, too many video games, getting too much sun. Most of these change your brain structure, change the way you think, the way your reward response functions. Alcohol is no different.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You can come up with a laundry list of reasons why you shouldn&amp;#39;t drink alcohol. The fact is, you can come up with a laundry list of reasons why you shouldn&amp;#39;t do almost everything. It&amp;#39;s dangerous to drive a car, or hike a mountain, or travel, or be intimate with someone. Nevertheless, these things are part of the human experience, and can be sources of immense pleasure when enjoyed in moderation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0

"I think that most fashion is arbitrary and people take it far too seriously. I am for people wearing whatever they feel like at home, in almost all workplaces, and in public. CMV.","I don't see good reason for most fashions to get any significant amount of preference in society. Especially preference by those in power and especially in the workplace. I think that the reason most people like what they like is due to cultural conditioning. I don't believe that wearing suits, formal wear, or business casual should (in an ideal world) give any person any advantage over anyone else (be they coworkers or job applicants). The only exception to this would be situations where the clothing is absolutely necessary for the job role (i.e., police officers or military personnel easily distinguishing themselves from civilians).  The reason for this is that business fashion, and fashion in general, typically discriminates against the poor and against non-majority cultures. If you don't look like you belong to ""white culture"" or ""American culture,"" you don't get certain kinds of friends or the white collar job. This is true regardless of how equally, or more, qualified you might actually be. I think focusing on the way an individual's threads align and the colors over their skin distracts from focusing on what really matters: ethics and talent.  Additionally, incase it comes up, yes I would be okay with public nudity. But only within a society that could observe nudity and have enough self-restraint to not harass, assault, comment, or follow the nude person. I believe that this is possible.

If he was barking orders at someone, they would probably ignore him simply because he doesn&amp;#39;t really &amp;quot;look important.&amp;quot; His look is immature, and I&amp;#39;d probably want him bringing my workers coffee, not telling them what to do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What you wear always conveys a message. Many workplaces have a dress code to keep the atmosphere professional, and to prevent people from getting to casual with their work. I don&amp;#39;t know about you, but I&amp;#39;d probably feel obligated to work harder in an environment where I&amp;#39;m surrounded by people in suits, not in an environment where I&amp;#39;m surrounded by people in t-shirts and sweatpants. It&amp;#39;s psychological, professional surroundings and looks promote a professional attitude.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just my $0.02.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding a dress code and dressing appropriately accomplishes several things:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) It signals an ability to follow and understand rules &lt;em&gt;even when they are unstated&lt;/em&gt;. That is, by dressing appropriately, you show a respect for and willingness to join in the culture of the workplace. Not doing that shows you don&amp;#39;t care or that you don&amp;#39;t actually understand, both of which are bad signs to an employer. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) It signals a willingness to make an extra effort. Poor dressing is often lazy dressing. As between the guy that makes the time and effort to clear and properly wear a suit and the guy that comes in with jeans and a t-shirt, the person in the suit has shown a willingness to make an extra effort. All else being equal, the guy who makes the extra effort will naturally seem more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) Aesthetics are real, and they matter. Not all fashion is actually equal, just as not all people are actually equally physically beautiful. Knowing how to dress well encompasses many subtle aesthetic skills, such as color coordination, flattering use of lines, proper fit, and the look and feel of a piece of clothing. A person that knows how to put those things together clearly has an ability to recognize certain types of patterns. The better a person is at doing it, the better they tend to look. This helps in not just making yourself look attractive, it also signals that you have at least a certain degree of intelligence in the form of visual pattern recognition. If you think that is a joke, you should come to my school some time. Some of the sharpest dressers I&amp;#39;ve seen happen to be some of the smartest people I know. Anyone can dress up, but it takes a certain keenness of mind to dress &lt;em&gt;really well&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"I think A Feast for Crows was a sub-par novel, CMV","Out of all the Song of Fire and Ice novels, it was easily the least interesting, but I felt like it fell short of Martin's normally fantastic writing abilities.  Cersei - In the first three novels, Cersei was portrayed as a conniving, scheming, evil mastermind.  She came out on top again and again, but in AFFC she mysteriously becomes a crazy, paranoid lunatic who is totally incapable of making any good decisions when it comes to ruling.  It was such a stark (har) departure from her earlier characterization it threw me for a loop.  The cast of characters in AFFC didn't really do anything interesting.  Everything having to do with the Iron Islands is just uninteresting.  Their actions are totally removed from what the rest of the world is doing; they have no effect on anyone and no seemingly interesting plotlines that could spring from them until Euron shows off that horn at the end of the book (In the last chapter) after a long and boring build up.  I love Brienne of Tarth, but she doesn't do anything of note other than wander around aimlessly, stumbling upon some random ex-mercenaries, and (Once again in her last chapter) stumbles into something that might actually be interesting.  Sansa continues to be a disappointment in all aspects, which is nothing new, so I suppose I cannot fault Martin here.  Overall, the book just seems like filler.  It's just setup for A Dance With Dragons, but without any truly interesting suspense.  And no, I'm not just bitter that Danny didn't get any chapters, but it doesn't help Martin either.  Change my view","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: This post contains AFFC spoilers, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wow, I disagree with you on a lot of points. Yes, AFFC is my least favorite in the series so far, but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s as bad as you say. First of all, I actually loved what Martin did with Cersei in this book. In the first few books of the series, you get the impression that she&amp;#39;s a brilliant, ruthless, and dangerous. That&amp;#39;s the impression you&amp;#39;re supposed to get; it&amp;#39;s how many people in the ASOIAF universe see her. In AFFC, the reader&amp;#39;s eyes are opened to the truth. You realize that although Cersei is very powerful and dangerous, she really has no idea what she&amp;#39;s doing, and her mental state is becoming increasingly unraveled. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reason it seems like such a dramatic change, IMHO, is twofold. First of all, you simply never get a really good look into what she&amp;#39;s thinking until AFFC, so you don&amp;#39;t really have the whole picture. And second of all,  the death of Joffrey has led to her becoming even crazier than she already was, feeding into her paranoia. A paranoia which is actually somewhat justified when you learn about the prophecy she was given as a child that seems to portend doom for her remaining children and herself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As far as Brienne goes, I partially agree with you. She was my least favorite POV character, but her chapters had some interesting world building stuff in them. The whole speech about broken men given by that guy she&amp;#39;s travelling with (his name escapes me at the moment) is pretty damn fantastic. So although it doesn&amp;#39;t move the plot forward as much as I would like, her POV chapters aren&amp;#39;t a total waste.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And I couldn&amp;#39;t disagree more about Sansa. People always hate on her for no good reason. Yes, at the start of the series she&amp;#39;s a typical teenage girl, more concerned about boys and looking pretty than anything else. So what? Isn&amp;#39;t that how a lot of teenagers are, naive and concerned with relatively petty things?I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s right to hate her for being a pretty normal kid. And anyway, she has a very interesting character arc that I&amp;#39;m very excited to see develop. She&amp;#39;s had all her notions of chivalry and honor shattered by Joffrey and Littlefinger, and now she&amp;#39;s gaining a new picture of how the world really works and becoming much more savvy. She&amp;#39;s picking up knowledge from Littlefinger, almost like his student. I, like many other readers, believe this could be setting up an interesting conflict, where the apprentice betrays the master, getting revenge for her father and leading to a situation where Petyr is destroyed by his love for Catelyn (which is now being expressed by his odd attachment to Sansa).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And your claim that it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;filler&amp;quot; setting up for ADWD doesn&amp;#39;t make a lot of sense to me, as the novels mostly take place around the same time. The books exist in their present form because Martin realized he had too much material for one book, so he decided to divide it by POV characters rather than chronologically. So AFFC doesn&amp;#39;t set up for ADWD very much at all, IMO.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like I said, I agree that it&amp;#39;s the weakest in the series, but it&amp;#39;s by no means a bad book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEGA SPOILERS, NON READERS BEWARE!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cersei - In the first three novels, Cersei was portrayed as a conniving, scheming, evil mastermind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Was she? Things went her way, but generally she had little hand in it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jon Arryn? She and Jaime got lucky.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bran? She didn&amp;#39;t even send the failed assassin.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;King Bob? It was a long shot and may even come back to bite her (Lancel).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eddard Stark? Himself/Littlefinger.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Saving KL from Stan? Tyrion/Grandpa Lannister.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Plus, remember she is very much unhinged by at the end of Storm. Murderous imp ( you think) takes out your eldest son and your father in what should be the safest place in Westeros, perhaps in concert with your master spy. Paranoia seems appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, if the last Dorne chapter didn&amp;#39;t build suspense, shit son your standards are too high.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I agree, least favorite of the series.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I don't trust insurance companies one bit and thus never plan to get insurance. CMV,"First off, I live in a country that has a public health system, so I am not referring to health insurance in this.  I just dont see how having insurance is better then paying for something out of your own savings. I feel in the vast, vast majority of cases you would save money this way. I feel that having insurance for a very, very unlikely scenario is just the same as gambling.  I also feel that insurance companies will make it as hard as possible for you to make a claim and will try and reject you as much as possible (eg: 'Act of God'). I feel that government bodies who are supposed to regulate and monitor these such things have no teeth and dont make it any better. Even if you were to try to claim insurance for something very expensive, I do not think they would pay you.  I believe the amount of claims that you would make during your lifetime will never exceed even half of what you pay for insurance.  Everyone tells me I should get it so obviously there is something in it. I just need to CMV!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what type of insurance you&amp;#39;re specifically referring to. But insurance in general is used to cover losses - especially on things you cannot afford.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I agree with you, that you would not insure something that is worth very little. However, something like auto insurance could lead to protecting you from claims that would otherwise bankrupt you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re measuring a cost benefit analysis. Odds of using vs benefit from using. However, that is not the way it needs to be looked at.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let me demonstrate with a numerical example:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Assume:&lt;br/&gt; your net worth is $100000 if you get into a car accident, the damages will be over $100000&lt;br/&gt; the probability of you getting into a car accident is .1%  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A car insurance company would charge you more than .1% * 100000 = $100 to insure you. Your implication (which I agree with) is that the more than $100 (let&amp;#39;s assume $200 for the rest of my post) they will charge for insurance is higher than fair.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here is why I don&amp;#39;t agree with you:&lt;br/&gt; With Insurance: Net worth = $100000 - $200 = $99800&lt;br/&gt; No Accident (99.9% chance): Net worth = $99800&lt;br/&gt; Accident (.1% chance): Net worth = $99800  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Without Insurance: Net worth = $100000&lt;br/&gt; No Accident (99.9% chance): Net worth = $100000&lt;br/&gt; Accident (.1% chance): Net worth = $0&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Would you not rather have a guaranteed net worth of $99800 (instead of $100000) than risk the chance of being completely bankrupt?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That all having been said, if the numbers are the same and your net worth is 100 million instead of 100000 I can see your perspective as the worst case scenario would not put a large dent in your lifestyle&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance is the same as the extended warranty on appliances. You are paying more up front to prevent yourself financial disaster if something happened. Of Course the insurance companies are able to price premiums in a way they always stay profitable. You however get the benefit of piece of mind, knowing if the worst happens you are covered. Auto insurance is important because most people couldn&amp;#39;t afford to pay a huge claim out of pocket and they also cover uninsured drivers hitting you. All insurance is probably considered negative lifetime equity, however they are important in  helping people avoid financial disasters. One massive car accident, home fire or medical claim could bankrupt you and your family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: I believe Communism has spelled nothing but authoritarian disaster in practice, and anybody seriously endorsing it in the 21st Century should be ridiculed profusely","I take no issue with chewing out modern communist sympathizers. Communism is a utopian, unattainable ideal for society that has failed miserably in every society that has attempted to replicate small-scale tribal camaraderie on a national scale. Magnitudes more people than were killed in the Holocaust died as a result of ""Communist"" regimes that never advanced beyond the ""Proletarian Dictatorship"" stage. People had little freedom to specialize or better their lot in a society where exceptional talent was spared to barely sustain the collective. Even in modern China, nobody can leave, protest, or complain without fear of violent retribution from the omnipotent state that invariably arose from communism. That certain people in my university still condone this totalitarian ideology deeply disturbs me.   I'm not saying they should be imprisoned or censored or infiltrated by COINTELPRO, but sympathizers should be called out and ridiculed like racists and Neo-Nazis trying to jumpstart the Fourth Reich. With almost no exceptions, explicitly communist states have acted as a conduit for totalitarian violence and human suffering on a level surpassing even Nazism itself.   Communists of Reddit, tell me what went wrong with well-intentioned communist governments throughout the last century - and how your proposal wouldn't yield the same outcome. Einstein said the definition of insanity is repeating your failures hoping for a different result - he may as well have been defining communism.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I don&amp;#39;t think that the Soviet Union is an example of a state that &amp;quot;failed miserably&amp;quot;. Socialism (not communism, you confuse those two terms a lot) transformed Russia from a backward, agrarian country to an industrialized superpower in a few decades. The Soviet Union played a huge part in defeating the Nazis and was the first nation to launch a sattelite, an animal and a human into orbit. I am in no way claiming that everything was fine in the Soviet Union but you can&amp;#39;t call that a miserable failoure.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;...that has attempted to replicate small-scale tribal camaraderie on a national scale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That is in no way what communism is. Wikipedia reads:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Communism is a socioeconomic system structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and characterized by the absence of social classes, money, and the state; as well as a social, political and economic ideology and movement that aims to establish this social order.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tribal camaraderie has nothing to do with that. It is just an alternative way to strucutre a &lt;strong&gt;modern&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. one that already contained social classes, money and means of procduction) economy and society.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;People had little freedom to specialize or better their lot in a society where exceptional talent was spared to barely sustain the collective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One could argue that people have &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; freedom to specialize in Socialist countries because education is free and highly encuraged. Cuba has a 99.8% literacy rate (a lot better than most capitalist countries including the U.S.) which it attained after a socialist revolution against a capitalist dictator. Cuba also has 6.7 physicians per 1000 inhabitans. The U.S. has 2.4.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Again, the Soviet Unions space program (among others) would be unachievable if &amp;quot;exeptional talent was spared to sustain the collective&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even in modern China, nobody can leave, protest, or complain without fear of violent retribution from the omnipotent state that invariably arose from communism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;China is not communist (no country is, as communism implies that no state exists). China is also not socialist. There is no collectivized ownership of the means of production. The economy is not (that) centralized and a free market exists. Countries like Sweden and Norway provide a lot more (and have a lot higher taxes) than China does.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;That certain people in my university still condone this totalitarian ideology deeply disturbs me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is nothing inherently totalitarian about communism (and there can not be because totalitarianism implies the existence of a state). Only socialist states can be totalitarian. But, the same is true about capitalism (I am from Greece where we had a capitalist dictatorship for example). If you look into it you will find that poverty and political instability is a stronger indicator that a totalitarian state will emerge than socialism.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not all communists support the actions and legacy of Stalin and Mao. There can be and are communists that are opposed to those practices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Communism is a utopian, unattainable&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First of all, do you know what communism is? As described by both classical communists like Marx, and modern, Western communists.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;has attempted to replicate small-scale tribal camaraderie on a national scale&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Communism is (mostly) about removing one thing: the police shooting the workers if they try to take control of their factory. The rest either follows from that&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;that never advanced beyond the &amp;quot;Proletarian Dictatorship&amp;quot; stage&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is very tempting to label pseudo-socialist regimes such as the USSR or China as a &amp;quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&amp;quot; (they are dictatorships as usually understood, and they seem rather proletarian).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, in Marxist terminology, this has a very particular meaning, and it&amp;#39;s opposed to a similar term: &lt;em&gt;dictatorship of the bourgeoisie&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;quot;Dictatorship of the X&amp;quot; means &amp;quot;a State which ordains society in a way beneficial to the X&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To find out &amp;quot;whose dictatorship is this&amp;quot;, you should ask &amp;quot;who benefits the most from the way the State acts?&amp;quot; And in the &amp;quot;allegedly communist&amp;quot; countries, this is not the workers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not that they &amp;quot;never got past that stage&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s that they never even &lt;em&gt;reached&lt;/em&gt; that State.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;People had little freedom to specialize or better their lot in a society where exceptional talent was spared to barely sustain the collective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As much as I can disagree with those regimes, I&amp;#39;m not sure this is a correct portrayal of most of them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;tell me what went wrong with well-intentioned communist governments throughout the last century&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You can figure it out just by reading a bit of Marx: communism is what follows capitalism, in the same way capitalism followed feudalism. Each system gives birth to the next, almost organically, though obviously those changes have required a great deal of sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, look at the countries that are ruled by a so-called Communist Party. How many of them were rich and industrial before that? How many of them were basically feudal, agricultural, poor, and plagued by illiteracy?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Education is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; key for a prosperous and free country.

CMV: People with depression are really just over dramatic and ungrateful,"I'll start with this: I  do not understand depression. I know a couple people with diagnosed depression, and they laugh and have fun and vocally commend their lives as awesome in a moment of joy or good happenings. Meaning I've seen them happy, and it sure looks genuine.   So why do they want to kill themselves? Why the want to waste and squander life? Is it a constant struggle that is pushed down to smile? Is it a scheduled feeling (it's 8pm, time to be sad and want to kill myself)? Is it a feeling that rears in an acute intensity when you're not ready for it, making you just want to stop the pain?  Personally, I feel like it's just people being dramatic. These people I know with it have very fortunate lives, and despite that, continue to feel depressed and occasionally suicidal (or maybe constantly, I'm not telepathic).  I want to respect the disease... But I just don't understand it enough to do so. CMV","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have clinical depression, but I do have a neurological disorder that I think works as an apt analogy in this situation. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have tourette&amp;#39;s syndrome. It doesn&amp;#39;t manifest itself in the stereotypical way in which the media often presents it (i.e., &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprolalia""&gt;swearing and yelling&lt;/a&gt;), but it does &amp;quot;force&amp;quot; me to repeatedly engage in some pretty annoying tics. They&amp;#39;re small, physical things that wouldn&amp;#39;t be extremely obvious to strangers or even friends, but they&amp;#39;re there. Here&amp;#39;s the thing about my tics: they&amp;#39;re not completely involuntarily. Most of the time, I am performing them consciously; I know what I&amp;#39;m doing; I don&amp;#39;t want to do it, but I still do it. Why? Because I feel like I have to. It&amp;#39;s like an itch, and if I don&amp;#39;t scratch it, it&amp;#39;ll gnaw away at the back of my mind. I suppose it&amp;#39;s kind of like OCD, but rather than the urge being invoked by some external source, it&amp;#39;s constantly inside of me, demanding I do these things. From an outside perspective, I wouldn&amp;#39;t expect someone to understand it. I could easily see someone asking, &amp;quot;Why don&amp;#39;t you just stop? Take control! Use some willpower.&amp;quot; And I can, sort of. But not all of the time. Can you imagine being itchy all of the time, every day, and forcing yourself to never scratch? It would take more energy to remain focused, and more focus on the itch itself, than it would take to just scratch it once in a while. I&amp;#39;m saying all of this to try and convey the nature of a disorder. It is &lt;em&gt;dis-order&lt;/em&gt; of the body, whether neurological, chemical, or whatever physiological forces normally keep us in check. Obviously I can&amp;#39;t just will myself to be normal, because if that were possible for my brain, I&amp;#39;d do it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, depression has far different mechanisms than tourette&amp;#39;s and manifests itself in a far different way, but I empathize with those who suffer from clinical depression. I realize that, like me, there is an imbalance going on that simply doesn&amp;#39;t let them be as they&amp;#39;d like. People with depression can be depressed for no true reason, and it&amp;#39;s not their fault. Worse yet, they can&amp;#39;t just will themselves to be happy. If they could, they wouldn&amp;#39;t have clinical depression, would they? Think about what people actually are: we are just a self-aware representation of our brains. And if there&amp;#39;s something influencing our brains to react in a certain way, there&amp;#39;s not much we can do to counteract that, because &lt;em&gt;we are our bodies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t expect you to understand how other people think, because you&amp;#39;re not them. Half the time, we barely understand all the emotions and underlying forces that makes us who we, ourselves, are. How could we presume to know each other even more intimately than we know ourselves? Hell no people with depression aren&amp;#39;t ungrateful; they&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;depressed&lt;/em&gt;. For reasons they might not even know and reasons they probably cannot control.

It isn&amp;#39;t something that can be controlled. For some people it is triggered by different things, and for some it is random, for others it is constant... it is variable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For me, it was always night time, when nobody else was around I was alone with my thoughts and insecurities and had nobody to sound these things off of to tell me &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s absurd, you are wrong about how horrible you are because of [reason]&amp;quot;, and so that pessimism got to me on a pretty deep level.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As someone else said: If you want to be sociable with that sort of thing going on in your head, you just don&amp;#39;t say it and you put on masks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I understand not understanding a mental disorder. They aren&amp;#39;t discussed, people hide them as if they are shameful.

CMV:I am no longer for a non-interventionist Ron-Paul style foreign policy.,"For a long time, I followed Ron Paul's reasoning on the war in Iraq that we were doing more harm than good, and that bringing our troops home would reduce threats of terrorism and save us money in the long run.  So we did that, ISIS formed, and terror threats are much greater than they were before. I still follow Ron Paul and his message has not changed whatsoever despite his assertion that leaving Iraq would be better for everyone.  I think that the biggest mistake Ron Paul and libertarians in general made was assuming that leaving the middle-east would cause extremists to forgive us. The reason they hate us so much is not because we were over there, but because we support Israel, their number 1 enemy.   The libertarian answer to that is to simply stop funding and supporting Israel, but I don't think that is a good idea, especially on a moral level. People argue Israel is strong enough to defend itself, but that is only because of all the military support we give them. Without us, they would be overrun by the bordering Islamic nations that routinely vow to wipe them out.  So we are basically stuck defending Israel, which means we have to defend ourselves from attack. Simply leaving the area didn't stop extremists, it only made them regroup and strengthen. Libertarians argue that it's only moral to attack someone that attacks you first, but when it comes down to it, it would be better to fight them overseas rather than wait for them to come here.  Libertarians also argue that we should not be the world police. I do sympathize with this point, but we should also realize that if we were not doing it, russia or china would take over the role, and use invaded land as a military advantage. I used to believe that they were not interested in expanding land, but Russia's actions in Ukraine show otherwise, and China is making economic strides for power that could turn into something more in the coming decades. If the point of intervention is to impose political values on a country, then the U.S. is definitely the lesser of the 3 evils when it comes to values.  2014 has definitely been a big year for a shift in political views for me and I feel a lot of my libertarian views slipping, can anyone take a stab at tilting me back towards non-interventionism?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of Facts for you:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Al Queda was United States created group, they led to the creation of ISIS. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Saddam Hussein had all the means to protect Iraq from such terrorist groups. We often believe that someone is a horrible dictator that needs to be removed until we see the next one to take over. Under Saddam Hussein&amp;#39;s rule there was a healthy christian population with respected rights in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ghadafi was overthrown by Al Queda linked terrorist groups much like ISIS. The USA interventionist policies supplied weapons which spread all across the region. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The exact same thing happened in Syria. Except Syria had stronger ties with Russia and Iran and is able to cling to power. Luckily Assad had enough Russian military equipment to deter an American Invasion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If we had left the region alone, there is a high chance instead of ISIS, we would still be talking about about a few greedy dictators and how they are mistreating the citizens of their oil rich nations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States for most of it&amp;#39;s modern history as a superpower has been interventionist, what has been the end result?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take just Latin America. Latin America because it&amp;#39;s in our own backyard with no natural enemy states should by all means be the richest and freest region besides our own. Instead, it was run almost exclusively by US-backed dictators who murdered, tortured, and displaced untold millions of individuals. The continent is now defined by oligarchical concentrations of wealth, rampant poverty, blocs of criminal syndicates, the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take the Middle East. In the 50 years of US involvement, the major peaceful power--Iran--had it&amp;#39;s democracy overthrown, replaced with a military dictatorship which was replaced with a near-theocratic state. Peace has been blocked in the Israel-Palestine issue which has led to millions being displaced and untold thousands dead. Radical Islamic governments have been consistently supported over secular regimes or progressive ones which has helped the region slide into tribal conflict, religious extremism, barbaric violence, and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The examples go on much further but the point is the USA has not ever had successful intervention that results in lasting positive change for a nation in any serious way outside of it&amp;#39;s immediate First World allies. We have managed to maintain perpetual poverty in large swaths of the world, rip apart the social fabric, provide fertile ground for violence and extremism, and then ramp up our violent efforts to rectify it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you use a hammer long enough, everything begins to look like a nail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV:The recent cheating scandal involving teachers Atlanta is not the fault the convicted teachers but instead of high standards placed by standardized testing and thus the teachers should not be convicted,"Link to article for those unaware: http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/14/us/georgia-atlanta-public-schools-cheating-scandal-verdicts/ A long read, but worth it if you have the time: http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/21/wrong-answer  Recently 9 teachers in Atlanta were sentenced for their roles in a large coordinated cheating effort involving elementary and middle schoolers and their standardized tests. Some of these teachers have been sentenced to jail for 7+ years and many fined upwards of 50k. I believe that while it may be easy to simply blame these teachers, it is more important to understand why these teachers felt the need to cheat. They did so because of the high stakes placed on the schools by NCLB (No Child Left Behind). These put immense pressure on teachers to get their students test scores up and instead don't allow teachers to focus on the individual needs of each student. I also believe that the punishment given is far too strict. Yes, what the teachers did was wrong, but it is not worth of 7+ years in Jail.  Anyways Reddit, CMV, I'm open and education is a large interest of mine and will be happy to discuss this with you guys! _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

But where is the protest to go hand-in-hand with their law breaking? How do we know their message? If they were rallying in their free time to repeal NCLB, and this was one of many actions to that end, then it may be okay. But this action of cheating stood on its own without any protest around it, so it doesn&amp;#39;t really count as justified civil disobedience. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP, &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You are letting your emotions get in the way of what should be considered guilty or not.

You look at these kids in the poor neighborhoods and you feel bad, reading your responses you obviously have personal connections with them, but you have to understand that these teachers committed multiple felonies that are agaisnt the laws of the state of Georgia.

Creepy? Yes. Morally wrong? Most would agree so. Ask most people and they would say he should be convicted, but look at the result. He wasn&amp;#39;t convicted? Why not? The law in Massachussets essentially was outdated and made before the rise of cameras, and thus it WASN&amp;#39;T Illegal for him to take the pictures. After this case a huge cry of feminists protested this, but they just like you, having a personal feeling about the case let that get in the way of their judgement. Soon the upskirt photos were banned in Massachussets closing the loophole &lt;a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/07/justice/massachusetts-upskirt-bill/""&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/07/justice/massachusetts-upskirt-bill/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Take the Trayvon Martin shootings. An unarmed black male was shot and killed by a neighborhood watchman. Many will disagree what happened, but under florida law Mr. Zimmermans actions were LEGAL. That doesn&amp;#39;t make them MORAL. Do I know what happened that night? No. The only two people that truly know is Mr. Zimmerman and Mr. Martin and one of them is dead and the other could very well be lying about it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The law is not there for judges or juries to morally judge. Everyone has different standards of morals. Some say gay marriage is immoral, some say porn and booze is, but as we&amp;#39;ve seen with court decisions even southern red states are overturning gay marriage bans.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Morally, I agree with you, but legally these teachers broke the law knowingly. whether it be the right thing to do or the wrong thing that&amp;#39;s for people to decide, but they still broke the law and they need to be punished for it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
There should be limits on how much money a family can lose to a Casino within a certain time-period. CMV,"A Casino just opened up near me, and it is HUGE! There are over 3,000 slots, 150+ tables, and tons of other games / VIP rooms; encompassing 260 acres. It's basically a Mega-Mall or adult Disney Land, and people are being drawn to it like flies to a light-bub. The worst part is that it is located in front of a major shopping center where thousands of locals do their daily shopping &amp; errands. It blows my mind when I think of how many families will be destroyed because the mother or father found an easy way to forfeit their incomes to gambling, alcohol, and expensive steaks. I have known half a dozen people, one of which personally, whose families were destroyed by gambling. By having Vegas styled Casinos in the middle of a suburb and in front of our shopping mall, our community will suffer.  The negative effects that gambling has on middle / lower class communities is extremely detrimental to their financial &amp; social stability; especially with how it stagnates their climb up the socioeconomic ladder. My argument is that: we should define or enforce limits on how much a single family can potentially lose to a Casino within a certain amount of time. I understand how difficult it would be to legislate this, and it may be better to use more subtle approaches; but I seriously believe that a compromise could be reached. The simplest way would be to disallow excessive losses based on whether or not you have claimed dependents on your taxes.  **Pros:**   * Much of the ""high"" that addicts experience comes from the anticipation of their next win. It is the constant need for that gratification which drives their over-spending. As with drug addiction, when you delay the gratification along extended periods of time; addicts start finding better ways to focus their energy and attention. Of course, some will translate that desire to other addictions, but most realize that: ""I'm doing just fine without it.""  * ~~I believe Casinos are borderline criminal. Anything to damage their ability to suck money out of hard-working people is O.K in my opinion. There are much better ways that we can invest our time &amp; money.~~ MVC.  * The first step to conquering addiction is to admit that there is a problem. Casinos do the EXACT opposite, though, as they mask the reality with free booze and the constant lure of wealth. By at least recognizing the problem at the source, I believe more attention will be brought to the issues. Even if it's just as ineffective as the ""Smoking Causes Cancer"" labels on cigarettes, it's still better than nothing.  **Cons:**  * By regulating the Casinos, you encourage the establishment of illegal operations. These are more damaging to a community.   * Extremely difficult to legislate, and Casinos would fight it to the death; no matter what the compromise was.  * There may be other more effective ways to combat the problems associated with Casino culture, and this one would be controversial.    [Here is a calculator](http://vegasclick.com/gambling/expectedloss.html) which shows the average expected losses per/hour. Who knows how accurate this is, but we do know that Casinos are very profitable.   TL;DR: If someone has children, the amount of money they can lose while gambling should be limited. So as not to feed the socio-economic reality where 'the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer'.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re going to follow that logic through you wind up restricting so many things that you might as well argue for universal state run orphanages. How would you even track this? Fingerprinting at the pull of every slot machine. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also like to point out that you don&amp;#39;t know any families destroyed by gambling. You know families destroyed by family members.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here is a compromise play. Have some kind legal system set up where it is actually really easy to initiate proceedings to have someone declared unfit to handle their finances and a guardianship is initiated. Things like detrimental gambling habit and alcoholism would be the kind of thing that one would have to prove for a loved one. Once that is done make it so that that guardian can have that person put on a &amp;quot;no play&amp;quot; list on file at the casino. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe Casinos are borderline criminal. Anything to damage their ability to suck money out of hard-working people is O.K in my opinion. There are much better ways that we can invest our time &amp;amp; money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is quite dangerous to advocate wielding the violence of the state just because activities among adults pisses you off and you think they could do better things with their time and money. Much better to devise a system where the percentage with some sort of addiction disorder can be locked out of the activity and taken care of. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gambling is an addiction. If a parent has an addiction to gambling, limiting their access isn&amp;#39;t going to change the reality of their disease. It would be along the same logic of limiting the amount an alcoholic can drink; an alcoholic has a disease and &amp;#39;limiting&amp;#39; won&amp;#39;t change their desire to drink. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those with addiction will find a way to do these things, regardless of the amount of &amp;#39;restrictions&amp;#39; you put in place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV:I think that a supersoaker full of lighter fluid and a lighter are arguably a better stick up weapon than a pistol, and the poor rate of adoption points to a lack of innovative thinking within the criminal element of society.","The postulate is that the Armed Robbery Industry is ripe for disruption by a new breed of supersoaker wielding thugs.   Seriously,  what could be more terrifying? A clerk soaked in a flammable liquid is a cooperative agent,  and everyone else is going to leave as fast as they can.   Guns are poor choices for a stick up for several reasons:   1 Expensive, traceable, not self disposing.  2 Very limited ammo, easy to miss your target  3 Only terrifying to the person you are pointing it at.  4 Cannot preemptively half shoot yourself so that no one wants to touch you, just in case you decide to set yourself on fire (for emergency use or rage mode only)  5 No ""burn this place to the ground"" mode  6 Only two, not 3 stages of escalation.

A gun is the swiss army knife of the criminal world. You can use it to rob the clerk, shoot the would be hero at the back of the store, shoot at the cops, cover your escape, whatever you need to do. Its also easier to reload. You pop out a clip, pop in a new one. If you run out of lighter fluid, and now your only option is burning people alive. You can&amp;#39;t cover your escape with it, they&amp;#39;ll just shoot at you from afar, they will outrange you every day. Burning to death is also slow, and it&amp;#39;s easy to remove your ammo supply.

I think that the stock market is full of capitalist leeches who produce no value yet siphon off capital from the market. CMV,"First, a disclaimer: I'm not an economist, and a lot about financial systems confuses me.  That said, I think financial markets are infested with capitalist leeches, who make money for doing nothing.   My understanding of how an ""investment"" should work is that you research trends and take an informed guess as to how a company will fair in the future, kind of like political donations; candidates with no chance aren't worth investing in, while in tight races a little investment can push one candidate over the top.  You take a little risk and earn a lot of profit when a company succeeds.   But this isn't how most professional trading is done.  More than half of all trading is [High-frequency trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading).  Basically computers watch the market, look for trends and near instantly respond to get a cut of the profit.  When a stock goes up, they jump in and buy lots of shares, and then immediately sell when the rise starts to cap. These trades happen within milliseconds, and they're getting faster as infrastructure improves.  What value do High frequency trades provide?  They are not ""investing"", they're leeching off other investors.  By buying and selling so quickly, they provide no capital for companies to use, as it's gone almost immediately.  I always hear about how important Wall Street is to the economy, but how important can it be if it's just a forum for huge companies to suck capital from smaller, legitimate investors?  Things can't be as bad as I'm imagining, please CMV.  Edit: It seems like HFT is the natural evolution of [Day trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trading), which I see as similarly useless and exploitative.  I'm not too focused on HFT, more on rapid trading in general that doesn't fit the definition of an ""investment"", or any other conceptual flaws someone might identify.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;lurkti&amp;#39;s response is pretty solid, and definitely covers most of the good reasons to not hate on professional traders en masse.  I have a slightly different perspective to offer, although I also work at a trading firm so it will be pretty similar.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, a definition.  Market makers are people or firms who are willing to both buy and sell a security at different prices, and traditionally try to make money by making both trades and making the difference between the prices they give.  So they can try to buy at $10.00 (the bid price) and sell at $10.02 (the offer, or ask price), and if both trades go through, they make 2 cents.  This is called the bid-ask spread.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now when you &amp;quot;invest&amp;quot; in a company, you&amp;#39;re buying in the secondary market (unless you get in on an IPO, which is uncommon for normal investors).  This means that you&amp;#39;re buying stock from other people who already own it and want to sell it, not directly from the company.  So you&amp;#39;re not actually giving money to the company, you&amp;#39;re just trading with other people who previously bought the stock from someone else (unless they&amp;#39;re selling short, meaning they borrowed the stock from someone to sell it to you, and they&amp;#39;ll buy it back later.  It&amp;#39;s not that important to the argument now).  This can be anyone from other investors to market makers. But how do you know how much it should be worth in the first place?  Who are you to say that Microsoft is worth $34 and not $40, or $10?  That&amp;#39;s where professional traders come in.  They spend all day trading with investors, reacting to news, creating pricing models, and even trading with other professional traders, in order to figure out what the best price of the stock is.  And then you come in and want to buy or sell, and they can tell you what the correct price of the stock is.  And for that service, they charge you 1/2 of the bid-ask spread.  So if the market in Microsoft is $33.87 (bid) at $33.98 (ask), you need to sell at $33.87.  Therefore the trader who buys from you wins $0.01 compared to the neutral price of $33.88.  So the professional trader figures out what the correct price of Microsoft is, and allows you to trade there, with a cost of $0.01 for their work.  The rest of the time, professional traders are just trading with each other, and from the investor&amp;#39;s perspective they might as well be jerking each other off since them trading with one another doesn&amp;#39;t affect you.  The point is that thinking of traders as &amp;quot;sucking money out of the economy&amp;quot; is the wrong way to think about it - they&amp;#39;re providing you the service of figuring out what the correct price is, and charging you a (very) small fee for letting you buy or sell as much as you want at that price.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People often talk about professional traders providing liquidity to markets - that is, offering to take the other side of any trade that any investor wants.  However, I don&amp;#39;t think this is the best way of thinking about it. Professional traders make the markets more efficient, and they make their money off the inefficiencies.  Sometimes this means providing more liquidity, and sometimes it means taking away liquidity that other traders are providing.  The optimal amount of liquidity occurs when a stock moves the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; amount in reaction to news or something of the sort.  This is another place that the competition of traders actually improves the market for investors.  I don&amp;#39;t have time now to go into much more depth but I&amp;#39;ll have some time later to keep going if you or anyone has more questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;HFT doesn&amp;#39;t really affect me as a long term investor. It obliterates my ability to do day-trading but really most people shouldn&amp;#39;t be doing that anyway. My investments grow in value over time with or without High Frequency Traders making money off of extremely small fluctuations in the market and I don&amp;#39;t buy or sell enough stocks at any one time for the pennies that they make off of each transaction to affect me in the slightest. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Buying an index fund and sitting on it is just as effective as it was in a pre-HFT world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: Police Officers Acting in Their Official Capacity Should Not Be Allowed to Invoke the Fifth Amendment,"This subject has been on my mind lately because of the case of Freddie Gray’s death. Long story short, Gray looked “suspicious” and gave chase. It’s still unclear when/how (was it on the foot chase? was it during the “rough ride”?) his spinal chord was severed 80% at the neck, but it was. He didn’t get medical attention for at least 30 minutes and within an hour, he was in a coma. He died a week later. 6 police officers have been suspended pending an investigation. One of these officers has invoked their Fifth Amendment rights to avoid self-incrimination.   It just inherently sounds wrong to me and I’ll try to explain why through this thought process:  - Police officers are given authority over civilians through virtue of enforcing the law.  - With great power comes great responsibility. They have more power than the average person, so they should be held to a higher standard. Police officers are supposed to enforce the law, so they shouldn’t be allowed to impede it.  - Police officers get power and authority. Civilians are subject to this authority and therefore have certain rights and protections against it. You can’t have it both ways. You can’t have both power/authority AND protections from it. If a police officer did something criminal while working in their official capacity, they should not have the same protections as civilians.   Just to be clear, I’m specifically speaking about instances when a police officer is working in his official capacity.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

"CMV: It should be against the law to describe something as ""free"" if a purchase is required to obtain it","It's so commonplace now to offer things ""free"" in order to sell products and services. For example: get 30 days free when you sign up to a 12 month contract; 50% extra free on a box of detergent, free £5 voucher when you spend £30 or more, etc etc.  If something is truly free, it comes at no cost to the consumer. No strings attached. When you get 50% extra detergent for free, what you're actually doing is paying for the whole box at less per gram than usual. They take the hit on the gross margin in order to sell more.  The word ""free"" in cases like this is misleading - as a consumer, to get these ""free"" goods and services, you end up worse off financially, and for that reason I think it should be against the law to use it if a purchase is required. Please change my view!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if this were implemented, it&amp;#39;s so specific as to be completely ineffective. You&amp;#39;re not going to change the nature of advertising by legislating specifically how you can use a word. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It would take advertisers about 30 seconds to figure out some buzzword or a turn of phrase that&amp;#39;s going to mean the exact same thing. Then you&amp;#39;ll have a problem with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; phrase. And so on. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this has been happening long enough that consumers know perfectly well about those tricks. If it were to be banned, the companies would just work around it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The real problem is not the language being used, but the consumer not being well informed. I suggest an alternative legislation: make it mandatory to advertise the price per 100 grams of product (packaging excluded obviously)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Why? Because with that you can immediately see whether that 30% bigger package really does have 30% more for the same price. More importantly, you&amp;#39;d immediately notice if a smaller package that costs less, actually costs more per 100 grams of product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"I get internally furious whenever girls/guys in a relationship (including my girlfriend) comment on the attractiveness of anybody else, especially celebrities, simply because I think it's wrong for a significant other to think about that sort of thing. CMV.","Please, Reddit...help me. I can probably think of where this all comes from, but I feel so justified whenever I get angry. I just want to stop associating watching movies with constant thoughts of ""I hope she isn't staring at his abs"" or something.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Man, I feel you. I used to be kinda the same way (still am, to an extent)... Like you and other commenters have said, it&amp;#39;s probably rooted at least somewhat in your own self esteem issues, so it would probably help you significantly to address those with the help of your gf if you feel.comfortable talking to her about it (for instance, how can she help make you feel validated/good about yourself/your body). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To address your actual statement, I, too get fed up with the frequency of things like saying which celebrity you would fuck or the attitude that if you got a chance with someone famous that would somehow make it okay and not cheating. I&amp;#39;ve tried to think about a situation where I would do that and I can&amp;#39;t come up with any combination of famous/beautiful person and my circumstances if I was still in a relationship, because I do feel it is completely wrong no matter who it is or if it&amp;#39;s just one time. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; that is actual physical action/fantasizing. In terms of looking, it has to be okay to do at least to some extent. Do you watch porn or appreciate the attractiveness of girls in movies and tv shows? If so, you understand exactly what is going on in your gf&amp;#39;s head - appreciation without necessarily wanting to act on that thought/feeling; the only difference is that when she actually comments on it you get upset. I personally think suppressing things like that and not talking about them is much worse than the occasional comment. Besides, when she tells you she thinks x guy is attractive, it usually implies that you are in some ways similar to whoever she is talking about, which can be viewed as a compliment. Also, if she is telling you, it often means she trusts you and feels comfortable with your relationship such that she can say things like that without having to worry about it negatively affecting your relationship (unless she is a bitch and just tells you because she wants to fuck with you, in which case obviously break up with her. But it sounds like your current gf is definitely not like that).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, a lot of communication has more to do with body language, tone of voice, etc. You can try and ask your gf to talk about things like that in a more matter-of-fact tone of voice (like one would talk about a painting, just less proper) and avoid speaking in a way that sounds like she&amp;#39;s really turned on or desires them sexually. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Obviously like with any relationship issue there&amp;#39;s a lot of compromise and give and take at play. I think the biggest thing is to somewhat separate sexual desires/actions from appreciating beauty. Hope this helped some... I just woke up so I&amp;#39;m still kinda ramble-y. Good luck man!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how I look at it. Just because you&amp;#39;re in a relationship doesn&amp;#39;t mean you suddenly stop finding anything besides your SO aesthetically pleasing. We are built to appreciate beauty, whether it&amp;#39;s in the form of a sunset or a brightly colored bird or an attractive person. You&amp;#39;re not going to become blind to all that just because you&amp;#39;re committed to your SO, and there&amp;#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with appreciating the fact that something or someone is pleasing to look at (as long as you don&amp;#39;t act on it). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been in a relationship for two years and I still find men besides my boyfriend attractive, but that doesn&amp;#39;t translate in any way to thoughts of infidelity. For example, I think Bradley Cooper is insanely sexy, but even if he walked in shirtless right now and asked me to marry him I wouldn&amp;#39;t have the slightest urge to say yes. I love my boyfriend, and that love goes way deeper than physical attraction. So I can be completely honest when I say that even if I find another guy attractive my thoughts don&amp;#39;t go any further. It doesn&amp;#39;t have to have a sexual meaning. I also happen have a huge lady crush on Charlize Theron, I think she&amp;#39;s stunning, and I have no problem with my boyfriend sharing that opinion. Honestly, I think it&amp;#39;s a little weird if he tells me that he doesn&amp;#39;t find ANYONE else attractive (celebrities or real people). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is so much beauty in this world! Don&amp;#39;t shut it out, and try to learn to be comfortable appreciating it for what it is. Obviously don&amp;#39;t go further and act on your appreciation, but know that it&amp;#39;s okay to look and go &amp;quot;why that Emma Watson sure has radiant skin.&amp;quot; Or something of the sort. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: The theatrical cuts of Lord of the Rings are superior to the extended cuts and should be considered the definitive versions.,"I'll preface this by saying I'm a fan of both the books and movies.  I like them both for different reasons, but gun to my head I probably slightly prefer the films.  (The hobbit movies can S my D though.)  IMO, the extended cuts seriously throw off the pacing of the films.  When watching the theatrical cuts, I get swept into the story.  When watching the extended cuts, I get distracted, and reminded that I'm watching a movie.  They break the fourth wall, if you will.  Peter Jackson agrees with me:  &gt;The theatrical versions are the definitive versions. I regard the extended cuts as being a novelty for the fans that really want to see the extra material.  &gt;I felt that I was sacrificing pacing and momentum in order for these scenes to go in.  The main objection to this, of course, will be that the extended cuts are able to include more scenes from the books, and are therefore better.  Personally, I think it's a huge mistake to judge the quality of an adaptation by how closely it mirrors the source material, rather than by the strength of it's story telling.  The LOTR movies are some of the best adaptations of all time *precisely because* they left a whole lot of the books un-filmed, and a whole lot more on the cutting room floor.  They stretched some scenes from brief chapters into center pieces (Helms's Deep) and cut out some of the more... esoteric portions completely (Tom Bombadil).  Basically, I'm glad Jackson opted to make excellent **movies,** instead of attempting a shot for shot visualization of a **book,** and I think the extended cuts subvert his success in that regard.  Books and movies are not the same, and in general, **the more an adaptation respects the inherent differences between the various media it's adapting to and from, the better the final product will be.**  This is much more important than it's faithfulness to the source material.  I believe this is true for all adaptations, not just LOTR.  Feel free to C my V on this larger point as well.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

With that perspective I enjoyed the extended editions more than the shortened. I felt like I was learning more about the world and characters in at. As far as pacing goes, both versions are slow and can drag outside the immediate action scenes. Look at the second movie, walking and talking to a short fight to walking and talking to a long fight. Adding the extra 40 minutes didn&amp;#39;t significantly chance the pacing to me. It&amp;#39;s still a long movie, I still care about the characters, and the fights are still cool.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As far as Peter Jackson&amp;#39;s opinion, the opinion of the author or producers of a content doesn&amp;#39;t dictate how it should be interpreted. He is a person who thinks A, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that A is the be all and end all. Like any piece of media once it&amp;#39;s released into the public it becomes its own beast that can have its interpretations judged by others.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I agree with you that the quality of the movie matters, but if both versions are good movies and didn&amp;#39;t make unnecessary changes then I think they are different rather than one being better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to point out that I absolutely &lt;strong&gt;could not&lt;/strong&gt; stand to read the LotR trilogy. And I tried. I loved The Hobbit, even though it got slow, but I found Tolkien&amp;#39;s prose to be far too slow-paced and filled with inane babbling about things too far removed from the plot.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I loved the extended edition because I get more engaged in an audio-visual medium than I do into books, as a general rule (this gets suspended for pretty much anything that starts with &amp;quot;Harry Potter and the...&amp;quot; but that&amp;#39;s an exception), and the extended trilogy let me really grasp the world of Middle Earth for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m the sort of person who, despite not really liking to read, will read summaries about the world surrounding my favorite movies or video games, because these are things I &lt;em&gt;want to know&lt;/em&gt; but typically aren&amp;#39;t in the film/game, so I endure the chore. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; that the extended edition helped with this, especially in this situation, because most of the answers to that on the internet before were &amp;quot;If you want to know more you should just read the damn books, scrub!&amp;quot; because nerds are like that sometimes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Plus size is unhealthy and all of its support encourages obesity in children.,"By ***plus size I mean obese and overweight models*** because those pictures are what I see labeled as plus size.   I know that most models are underweight. I do not support anorexia in people. However I believe that plus size models do not just raise the self confidence of overweight and obese women/girls, they make them think that it is healthy. Schools and the government are all for decreasing obesity because it is **unhealthy**.  I read that people want **plus size (obese) Barbies and Disney princesses. Perhaps pencil thin Disney princesses are not good but an obese one will make healthy girls think, ""My parents and school are stupid. I don't need to be a health weight to be pretty. Being obese is beautiful"".  That is not what we need. We need to encourage healthy weight.  CMV  EDIT: I see images of clearly **obese or overweight** women being called plus size. Not healthy, average women. This is what I mean by ""plus size""  EDIT 2: This is the [plus size Barbie](http://i.imgur.com/BIKlnVt.jpg) that is being shared. I know it's not real but its being encouraged  EDIT 3: This is the type of [plus size model](http://imgur.com/eZZzcHM) that is shared.  /u/Deezl-Vegas changed my view by explaining that plus size models do not encourage girls to want to be plus size. Instead they give girls the willpower to become healthier. I support it then.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi! I&amp;#39;d be happy to change your view based on your post. Obese people, let&amp;#39;s just call them fat, face a number of challenges, and finding clothing that&amp;#39;s appealing on them should not be added to the pile. You see, obesity as an actual disease has symptoms, such as an increased tendency to become lethargic, depressed or despondent. These symptoms make it increasingly difficult to develop the willpower to become less obese, and they are caused by two things:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) Increased body fat, quite simply, results in lower levels of metabolism and less of the brain chemicals that tend to lead to physical action. 2) The stigma caused by being fat causes depression and anger in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A common natural response to depression is eating, which results in a cycle of eating just to eat or eating just to escape your feelings, when indeed it&amp;#39;s the eating that is bringing on the feelings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In your post, you mention that you &amp;quot;believe that plus size models do not just raise the self confidence of overweight and obese women/girls, they make them think that it is healthy.&amp;quot; This mentality is actually much more likely to help them lose weight than almost any other. A happy, healthy-feeling person is naturally more active, more social and more inspired to hit the gym.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In my view, your view is contributing to the cycle of obesity more than plus-sized clothing models. We should accept people for who they are and educate them about healthy choices, but in terms of the psychology of the thing, making people think they are unhealthy or otherwise undesirable tends to result in weight gain, and plus-sized models have the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;#39;s a radical difference between &amp;quot;plus sized&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;obese&amp;quot;. Obese is someone who&amp;#39;s in direct physical danger as a result of their weight, while a &amp;quot;plus size&amp;quot; could literally be anything from slightly above a 24-ish BMI these days to several obese.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been treated with ridiculously skinny and clinically underweight models for decades now. Think of the Barbie doll - it&amp;#39;s literally only possible to have that frame if you have some kind of eating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s a case of fighting one extreme with another. I don&amp;#39;t agree that plus-size necessarily means obese, but we&amp;#39;ve surely been showcasing underweight models as the ideal standard for young women for decades now.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re right in the fact that we shouldn&amp;#39;t promote an unhealthy lifestyle to kids, but the fashion industry has done that for decades now, just in the opposite direction. It&amp;#39;s understandable that some of society wants to fight it when even people like Kate Upton get called fat by some people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps it&amp;#39;s a case of two extremes fighting to find a proper middle ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
I believe it is harder to come out and be accepted as bisexual than it is to come out as gay. CMV.,"I say this as someone who is bisexual and is having a hard time coming out due to fear or severe backlash. Part of it, I suppose, it because the majority of high schoolers are insensitive pricks with no regard for how others may feel, but that's beside the point. Some misconceptions and myths about bisexual people are  * They're more likely to cheat * You can't be *really* bisexual. It's one or the other * They're just lying to themselves about what they really are. They're still in the denial phase * Bisexuals are sluts. They just want to sleep around with EVERYONE * Bisexual women only do it to turn straight guys on (and with me being female, this one seems to be the most stupid, IMO) * Bisexuals are attracted to everyone they meet  Among others. Not to mention quite a bit of this heckling comes from within the LGBT community itself. Really, the only types of people 100% accepted in the LGBT community is the LG part. Don't even get me started on the trans* community. But again, I digress.  I can't accurately say any misconceptions about gay people, so I feel like it's best to leave them out as opposed to saying completely untrue things as if they were real.  So, please. CMV.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP, I might argue your points about it being harder to come out due to social repercussions based on a few points.  Let me tackle this by 1) showing what the misconceptions of being gay are, 2) talking about the gender difference in social outlook (there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; one), and 3) finally, discussing why I think you might feel the way you do about some of your points.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To tackle misconceptions about gays and potentially how it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;just&lt;/strong&gt; as bad to come out as gay (if not worse);&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Gays are still viewed as disgustingly promiscuous. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#39;re gay (especially a male), expect to have all your ignorant peers of the same gender assume that you&amp;#39;re immediately sexually attracted to them.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;People still think it&amp;#39;s perfectly socially acceptable to use gay as a negative (i.e. OP is a faggot).  How many people say &amp;quot;OP is a bisexual&amp;quot;?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;There still exists a large population of people who think homosexuality is simply a choice or mental defect.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;(Males predominantly), PDA is extremely frowned upon.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gender difference and social acceptance;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Let&amp;#39;s face it, in America (I&amp;#39;m assuming you&amp;#39;re from the US, OP?), females are more likely to be dismissed as &amp;quot;experimenting&amp;quot; than anything else.  Males tend to receive a harsher social judgement.  I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing Dan Savage here, but he said something along the lines of &amp;quot;A girl can kiss 100 other girls and still be curious.  However, if you took the biggest, toughest, baddest dude you know, and he sucks &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; dick...he&amp;#39;s labeled as gay forever.&amp;quot;  Given, Savage said it much better/funnier than me, but there&amp;#39;s some truth to it.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Bisexual girls tend to be more socially accepted than their male counterparts.  This, in part, is due to the douchey nature of straight men.  I realize there&amp;#39;s a whole lot more to it than this, but douchey &amp;quot;bros&amp;quot; certainly don&amp;#39;t make it better.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lastly, why you might feel the way you do about some of your points;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;I think maybe it&amp;#39;s perceived that Bisexuals are more likely to cheat is because of the false notion that having twice the dating pool automatically means you&amp;#39;ll take those opportunities.  Honestly, I don&amp;#39;t see how this makes it any &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt; to come out as Bi than gay...this point might make it &lt;em&gt;equally&lt;/em&gt; hard to come out, but certainly not harder.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The notion that you can&amp;#39;t really be bisexual &amp;amp; that bi women only do it to turn guys on.  To be honest here, this one is a little muddy.  Why?  Because it&amp;#39;s certainly the case that, somewhere in the 90s, it somehow became socially &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;edgy&amp;quot; for a girl to say she&amp;#39;s Bi.  Now I&amp;#39;m not saying that you fall into this category, what I&amp;#39;m saying is that &lt;strong&gt;the fakes have spoiled things for the genuine&lt;/strong&gt;.  In my &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; experience (I used to go out to the bars in my younger days), I met a good portion of girls who would go out and say they&amp;#39;re bi and drink and make out/fondle other girls all the while having men take phone pics and cheer them on.  None of these girls would ever date another girl, or get intimate with another girl.  They would just say it&amp;#39;s alcohol induced girlish fun, and the guys like it (yes, I&amp;#39;ve been told that before).  It&amp;#39;s a sad state that &amp;quot;Bi&amp;quot; has become the party girl code for &amp;quot;I like to get drunk and skank out to be an exhibitionist&amp;quot;, but it&amp;#39;s true.  That&amp;#39;s not the fault of the genuinely bisexual community.  Again, I don&amp;#39;t see how this makes it inherently &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt; for you to come out as bisexual.  I see how it could make it harder for you to be taken seriously, but not harder on you socially. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the end, I&amp;#39;m neither gay nor bi (I&amp;#39;m a heterosexual black male), and I say this so that you know something about the stranger on the internet who&amp;#39;s dolling out CMV advice.  I don&amp;#39;t personally know the plights of the LGBT community, because I&amp;#39;ve never had to live them.  The above that I offer is from my personal observation, experience, and education.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not harder to come out. It&amp;#39;s just harder to &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; out.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My bi friends who end up in long-term opposite-sex relationships get assumed by their families to have &amp;quot;settled down&amp;quot; and be &amp;quot;straight now&amp;quot; and so everything worked out alright. Their same-sex exes are also more likely to whine that those relationships were just experiments and they were taken advantage of, but those exes would&amp;#39;ve been whining about something anyway.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Frankly, most of the reason that gay people have issues with bi people comes down to &lt;em&gt;jealousy&lt;/em&gt;. A gay person can never, ever be with the one they love without it being obvious that they&amp;#39;re gay. A bi person can, since they can fall in love with someone of the opposite sex. They can get married and have kids the natural way. Their dating pool is also nearly 11x as big. A gay person&amp;#39;s dating pool is about a 10th of the sex they like, so about 5% of the population. A bi person&amp;#39;s dating pool is the 47ish% of the opposite sex that&amp;#39;s straight or bi, plus that gay or bi 5% of their own sex.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So yeah, you&amp;#39;re going to have slightly more issues with other gay people than a kinsey 6 would. And that&amp;#39;s pointless and stupid and sucks. But on the other hand, you still have the entire world of heterosexuals to choose from. There are gay women out there who won&amp;#39;t date bi women, but there&amp;#39;s not nearly as many of them as there are straight/bi men who will. I&amp;#39;d consider that more than a fair trade. (Plus those particular close-minded gay women tend to have other issues. I wouldn&amp;#39;t date one, and I&amp;#39;m not bi.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Being bi also makes being poly a heck of a lot more convenient, if you later decide that&amp;#39;s your thing. I&amp;#39;m starting to feel downright &lt;em&gt;selfish&lt;/em&gt; as being one of the few people at one end or the other of the kinsey scale in my group of friends.

"I believe that math best way to measure intelligence, please CMV.","Let me start out that this is coming from someone who is bad at math and not some smug STEM major (I start college in a few weeks and have not decided my major) . I have always received poor grades in math classes throughout school even when I got a tutor and came in before class to get extra help from the teacher. The only time I got great grades in math was when I had a teacher that I later learned graded work and tests upon completion not accuracy  I hold my view because I feel like after looking at math compared to other subjects, it seems like math is the only true subject. Science, technology and engineering (the rest of STEM) are all highly based in math and one could not succeed in either of those subjects without a high skill in math.  I look at history and other social studies and see only memorizing facts, dates and concepts. This distresses me because  those courses were some of the ones that I was the best at, but feel unsure of how much use I could get out of them in the ""real world""  Even the subjects I feel that are my best (English and literature) seems to show little measure of intelligence. When I look at all the English and lit classes that I have taken (all of them honors and A.P) at school I feel like the classes boil down to ones opinion of a text so there is no right or wrong answer as long as you can justify your answer. I can not think of any other subject that works this way and feel that even though I am good in this subject it seems rather useless unless you want to be a teacher, which I would only do if I had no other employment options.   When I look at mathematics I see a genuine skill, not memorization or justifying your opinion. There is only a single correct answer in math (I know there are a few exceptions but that is besides the point). At my school at least (I just graduated from a relatively small high school, graduating class of about 120) high level math classes are a strong indicator of intelligence. People at my school were shocked to learn that I was not in calculus (the highest level of math at my school) or even the level before it. My classmates often assumed me to be intelligent, due to the fact that I took several non math AP classes but I do not feel intelligent.   My low math scores on the SAT as well as my gpa made mine significantly lower than most of my friends. I feel that me not being good at math shows that I am less intelligent and that math is single best way to measure a persons intelligence.   I am very nervous about what to major in since I feel I could try to struggle through a STEM major, or study what interests me (the notion of doing what you love over what will make money has always bother me. Every non STEM major I am interested are considered to be some of the most useless majors around. I am afraid that if I major in a liberal  arts subject that my job prospects will be horrendous  I feel that math is the best way to measure a persons intelligence, even if it means that I am not intelligent. Please change my view!    Edit: Well, after reading the comments I feel like I was wrong. My view originates from the fact that I am not very good at math, so I have often viewed people who are good at math as being way smarter than I am. Also as I noted in the comment section, my view was re-enforced by assholes in higher math levels, who would always bash on the high level non math classes that I took. I still feel that math is a strong indicator of intelligence, and have feel like it would be difficult for some one who is not good at math to prove their intelligence to a person who is good at math.  On a side note, does anyone have any career related stories, as I have always been afraid that because I am bad at math, my career prospects are minimal compared to those who are good at math","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in a very similar situation as yours. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been in AP classes throughout high-school, but I took a &amp;quot;transitional math&amp;quot; class my freshman year due to my deficiencies in the subject. I have a cumulative 4.0 GPA, but my math scores in the ACT are less than pretty. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps understanding concepts and thinking in an abstract, non-linear form is the most important thing a human being can do. Math often comes down to memorizing formulas, remembering basic math skills, and intuitively linking what you&amp;#39;re doing now with what you&amp;#39;ve done in the past to solve similar equations. Understanding the concepts and the stories of history through cause and effect, critically evaluating it, takes skill that not every individual holds. A critical and logical mind can find beautiful connections that prove they understand humanity and cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem with viewing math as the best indicator of intelligence is that it&amp;#39;s not an objective ability - something not even literature or history can be considered. The truth is, it&amp;#39;s arbitrary to measure somebody&amp;#39;s intelligence based on their success in any subject. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Non-linear, free-form thinking is likely the only way to objectively measure ones intelligence. &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Hutter#Universal_artificial_intelligence_.28AIXI.29""&gt;Marcus Hutter&lt;/a&gt; would have you use mathematics as a way to gauge a third party&amp;#39;s intelligence, a very novel idea. He uses it similar to how a thermometer gauges the temperature of its&amp;#39;  surroundings. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my only problem with this: Just as a thermometer gauges the current temperature of its&amp;#39; surroundings, any current method evaluates ones current understanding of a variety of concepts. Water&amp;#39;s temperature will be altered by an incredibly vast array of external influences. Our &amp;quot;intelligence&amp;quot; will be altered by a huge archive of things, including mathematics. &lt;strong&gt;Neither the temperature of altered water nor the intelligence of an educated human being are intrinsic, so both will change.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even the subjects I feel that are my best (English and literature) seems to show little measure of intelligence. When I look at all the English and lit classes that I have taken (all of them honors and A.P) at school I feel like the classes boil down to ones opinion of a text so there is no right or wrong answer as long as you can justify your answer. I can not think of any other subject that works this way and feel that even though I am good in this subject it seems rather useless unless you want to be a teacher, which I would only do if I had no other employment options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Literally every other subject works this way. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we don&amp;#39;t always teach very well at the high school level, so we sometimes get people thinking that history is about memorizing dates and math is about using the One Right Method to get the One Right Answer. But in every academic field, being able to clearly and concisely argue in favor of a point is a necessary skill. If you&amp;#39;re just memorizing dates or just crunching numbers, you&amp;#39;re not really doing history or math.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
The idea of getting a sex change is ridiculous. CMV,"Gender isn't a real thing. There are human beings with penises, and human beings with vaginas. The whole idea of boy/girl and man/woman is just a product of gender roles and stereotypes. You can't be a man (person with a penis) and ""feel"" like a woman simply because you like to shop and play with barbies and wear dresses. You can't be a woman (person with a vagina) and ""feel"" like a man just because you like sports and beer. It doesn't make sense.  While these people deserve to be treated equally, just like anyone else, I think it's insane to get a sex change operation just because you don't conform with societies idea of a man or a woman. Yes, there may be difficulties, such as discrimination or finding a partner, but that's something that you just have to deal with. To me, it seems like the equivalent of a black man getting surgery to become white because he is discriminated against/wants to be with a white woman who does not want him because he is black.   I think getting a sex change is extreme conformity, something that these people advocate against. Because they don't agree with the way society portrays their gender, they change their anatomy to match the one society says they should have. These same people preach that conformity is bad and it's okay to be different. If it's okay to be different, why do you feel the need to get a sex change? I don't hate them, I just cannot agree with or understand their ideals at all. If someone could better explain to me the reasoning behind a sex change, and help me see it in a better light, then please do so.   Edit: I'm going to give a final round of ∆'s to the people who gave the most helpful answers. I'll be honest, I wasn't aware of the fact that trans people do in fact have differences in their brain function. Some other good points have been brought up, so my view has been changed for the most part. It's kind of led me to a different view which is probably more controversial than this one, but my view has been changed nonetheless. I can't keep up with the responses anymore so I'm gonna be leaving the thread now. Thank you to everyone who responded! ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may be the case for some people, but what about the person who just feels that their body is wrong, and wants to change it to appear more like the opposite sex, without conforming to the gender role for that sex? Many transgender people don&amp;#39;t conform to the gender roles of their preferred gender ... did you know, for example, that about 75% of trans women are attracted to women?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;People don&amp;#39;t get SRS to conform or to have people view them differently. They get it so they can feel whole. Look the concept of being trans and the dysphoria and discomfort that goes with it is difficult to understand without being trans, but seriously,  they do it to feel whole and comfortable with their body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Anyone protesting for Michael Brown is automatically an idiot.,"I am extremely angered when I hear things like Michael Brown was executed. Cops are not secretly serial killers who are just waiting for a chance to get away with killing someone. But that's how these morons are portraying the police. I refuse to believe that a member of the police performed a public execution under scrutiny of other bystanders. The cop isn't mentally ill. His actions must done alongside of some kind of self interest. Shoot an innocent person who poses no danger in the head execution style in public? Really? What possibly way of reasoning could lead to that conclusion? I was 100% confident since the very break of the news that the cop was unlikely to have done anything wrong. These protesters automatically assumed the cop was in the wrong and refused to acknowledge new evidence.  I get pissed off that people think Michael Brown is still a saint after the video of him robbing the store was released. Retards insist that it has nothing to do with the shooting. It has everything to do with it. The reality is that Michael probably thought he got caught, and therefore, his interactions with the cop was likely to be extremely aggressive. I imagine it went something like-  Officer - Hey you're blocking traffic  Michael - I ain't rob no store you fucking pig.  Officer - I didnt say...  Michael - These cigars ain't from the store.  Officer - I didn't ask about....  Michael - Fuck all ya. Always tryin a hold me down  Officer - Ok put your hands in the air!  Michael - Fly high or die tryin!! YOLO!! AHHH [charges head first at cop and gets shot like a retard]  Seriously, if the cop was a sick fuck and gets a boner shooting up black people, he could have done so in a secluded area at night when no one was around. It would have been his word against the world, no witnesses. Somebody please explain to me why people protesting in favor of this dead thief isn't a moron. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We saw him rob a convenience store on tape just before he got killed. I&amp;#39;m sure this was not his first criminal act, and it likely would not have been his last. But do you deserve to get killed for being a shithead?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Having said that, at this point, we don&amp;#39;t actually know for sure what happened. It very well could have gone down like you suggested, and then I would agree 100% with you. But some people are presenting a different story. Let&amp;#39;s say he was surrendering or was shot in the back (hypothetical). Would you change your opinion? What if that&amp;#39;s the only news you&amp;#39;ve heard? Some people on certain news outlets ran stories suggesting that. Wouldn&amp;#39;t you be pissed too?

If the cop in question did not know about the robbery, he was not justified in using deadly force. Until there is evidence that Michael Brown posed an &lt;em&gt;immediate danger&lt;/em&gt; to the cop, the shooting is not justified. Since he was &lt;strong&gt;unarmed&lt;/strong&gt;, the cop should have used less lethal methods. We don&amp;#39;t just kill people because they resist.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seriously, if the cop was a sick fuck and gets a boner shooting up black people, he could have done so in a secluded area at night when no one was around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or maybe the cop imagines up some &amp;quot;stop resisting arrest&amp;quot; story to justify shooting someone.

CMV:I am an anarchist,"Just as the title says I am an anarchist and I believe that government is a unnecessary evil. I believe this since most of it has got to do with emotions to be honest. My family and I have been screwed over numerous times by the authorities. As for the logical part, well my reasoning is that basically we see people cooperating with each other without any strong-arming or self-interest at all! Take a look at how people helped their friends, family ,etc.! And then my second logical reasoning is that power corrupts! This is evidenced by the fact that the government(Kuwait where I was born) arrests homosexuals, and the U.S.A. government arrests drug users, even if they aren't violent. Lastly, look at all the jackasses that are in power(U.S. Senate votes that climate change is not caused by humans)! Next is the fact that I believe that prisons are unnecessary and even dangerous. My reasoning is based on that prison is simply crime college. Basically people who go to prison, simply learn new skills for committing crime! This is evidenced by the fact that people go to prison a long time for usually minor crimes, such as breaking windows, while those who do major crimes, are given short prison sentences as evidenced by the recent cop brutality news in the U.S.A., anarchists have different viewpoints, but the main idea is that we find government unnecessary.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In these groups the prominent dominate. At first it was in small hunter gatherer groups, but as we settled down the tribal leaders had bigger organizational institutions arisen. These institutions bridged different groups of people, but for that bridge to be maintained two things needed to happen. The first being language, the second is being a common set of values and rules of conduct that ensured that people could find a common ground. These rules were the start of the law system, and of the centralized government.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You see, the government exists to exact order on people, order that is needed if people are to cooperate. In small family groups people don&amp;#39;t indeed need laws or government oversight, but when you need to create cooperation between several groups or tribes you have to have some kind of common base that everyone recognize as an authority, either an elder council or a monarch, or elected representatives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If we were to nullify government, we would only help other powerful people that are ready to use more power than you to rise to power without oversight or regulation. This thing means that human rights and lives will simply become forfeit in the eyes of those who are in power. See Syria and the rise of Daesh.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We have left the caves and the lives of hunter gatherers to build spaceships and sky scrapers, but that comes with a price.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to try to convince you that government is a &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; evil. Since your view is something that you hold closely, I don&amp;#39;t think I can make you a champion of government anytime soon. So I&amp;#39;ll settle for a compromise. But that&amp;#39;s okay, because I believe that government is exactly that, a &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; evil.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;we see people cooperating with each other without any strong-arming or self-interest at all&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;True. People come together in many ways by themselves. It&amp;#39;s the role of the government, among many other institutions, to make that the coming together of different people is as smooth as possible. It is certainly not perfectly efficient, no system can be. Even a system proposed by anarchists (which is often self-regulation) isn&amp;#39;t the best possible solution.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, consider safety standards for motor vehicles. Without an organization that has the ability (and authority) to define the standards, there would be no meaningful &amp;quot;standards.&amp;quot; If it were left solely up to individual manufacturers there would be more poorly made products since they would have no body to specify safety as an applicable concept. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now you would argue that the market will take care of it all. It won&amp;#39;t. There will be hierarchies of standards - the market will have cheap (low quality) seatbelts and more expensive (high quality) seat belts. By definition a low quality safety product is worthless. If it doesn&amp;#39;t provide safety it ceases to serves its purpose. So government provides a service that improves the efficiency of the economy in this case. And there are many cases where government serves a positive role in the economy. It doesn&amp;#39;t do it wonderfully, but I only have to convince you that it does it better than the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;my second logical reasoning is that power corrupts!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This one is easy enough to argue against. Only a small part of the government holds power, just as a very small part of the population holds most of the wealth. The clerk at the DMV office is just as bored and tired as a worker in any other customer service position. Governments are made up of a large number of very different people, in different positions, and very very few have much power. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;the government(Kuwait where I was born) arrests homosexuals, and the U.S.A. government arrests drug users, even if they aren&amp;#39;t violent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not all governments around the world do this. Judging government as a whole by the actions of a particular government isn&amp;#39;t a comprehensive way to argue that anarchism is better. After all, until very very recently homosexuality was loathed almost the world over. This has changed as society accepts that values derived from reason and empathy and better than the justice recommended in religion. Since a very small number of governments in the world are theocratic, I would make the case that the rise of government has freed people from the oppressiveness of religion. It gives people an (often) secular, or at least not explicitly religious, platform to decide future policy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;the jackasses that are in power(U.S. Senate votes that climate change is not caused by humans)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yup, they&amp;#39;re jackasses. The problem is that we need the jackasses to speak with jackasses from other countries in order to set standards for better environmental policies. If you think that having people from one country speak with people of another country will lead them to come to some agreement by themselves, without any form of oversight of the agreements, then you&amp;#39;re in for a big shock. There&amp;#39;s a reason we choose some among us to speak on our behalf, it&amp;#39;s so that too many cooks don&amp;#39;t spoil the broth. Surely, we need better cooks. But let&amp;#39;s not throw out a perfectly good dinner while doing that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Browsing the internet is the contemporary equivalent of reading a novel,"Often, [the word count on a viral blog post/article](http://blog.newswhip.com/index.php/2013/12/article-length) is roughly equivalent to a chapter in a book, which means with each of these articles you read at home, work, in between or during classes, you're *technically* mowing through a novel. Even when you're on Facebook, Twitter, /r/AdviceAnimals, etc., you are *still reading*. Consider the number of words even one image macro has. Then think about how many of them you've read today. I am willing to bet that 15 of them will net you *at least* 100 words. Now think of the 140 character tweets you read today. How many words do you think fit within that limit? And what about your Facebook status updates, YouTube video descriptions, *the comments sections on each of those*, your iPod's song and album titles, your text messages, Reddit threads, etc.?  ""*Well what about the literary value? Isn't Shakespeare more valuable than an inane tweet?*"" Hamlet doesn't contain *half* the raw angst found on a teenager's Twitter page. I've found more engaging and entertaining stories written in /r/fatpeoplestories. And where, besides online literature forums and classes, can you find people debating and discussing Hamlet? Yet nearly every single Reddit thread, tweet, Cracked.com article, and image macro invites and incites disagreement between people over the intent and content of the post. Here's what it comes down to: the internet is interpretable, discussable, and entertaining - three qualities that are present and valued in ""classic"" literature.  The *only* advantage a novel has over the internet is one, continuous story uniting the discussion, the themes and motifs, everything. Unless every single page you browsed in one day was all about the same thing, it's unlikely you'll have a *truly* equivalent experience, but for the most part, a good internet session is just like digging into your favorite book.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"CMV: If your people went through genocide a hundred years ago, you have no right to be personally butthurt about it.","Let me be perfectly clear here: I'm not attempting to trivialize genocide or ethnic cleansing or any sort of large-scale act of injustice. Every such act is abhorrent and needs to be prevented if possible, and remedied if not.  I have found myself unable to have meaningful conversations with many of my Jewish/Israeli or Armenian friends if we touch on either the Holocaust or the Armenian genocide. I don't think the emotional hypersensitivity they express is in any way justified considering how long ago these atrocities occurred and that they have not and will not affect them personally in any way.  My issue here really is temporally focused, which is why I'm not talking about the Rwandan genocide. Most adult Rwandans today lived through the genocide and have lost loved ones that they had met and spent time with.  I've taken to referring to a victimhood complex, where basically a significant portion of one's cultural or ethnic identity is based on being a victim, and I think it's petty and tremendously counter-productive. For example, I tried having a conversation with a Jewish friend about the ""draw the holocaust"" contest that was setup by some IranCartoon and my argument was basically that you can't defend the rights of publications like Charlie Hebdo to poke fun at Islam without also having to defend IranCartoon's rights to mock the Holocaust. This quickly turned into a lecture on how my friend's family was exterminated by the Nazis. My friend would not likely have ever met the extended family members who perished under the Nazi regime, and she is not in any way under threat here in the US.  Similarly, conversations about US-Turkey relations, or Turkey's potential role in the Middle East today devolve quickly into a ""recognize the Armenian genocide!"" rant, which I think is a little more justifiable because it involves validating one's own history, but still the issue remains that such a backwards focus is, in my mind, petty and counter-productive.  I don't think people born in the 80s, 90s or 00s, people who have not lost people whom they have met and valued, people who have hardly any personal connection to such events, are at all entitled to being overly sensitive, emotional, or upset when their narratives are questioned/challenged or when their histories are attacked or trivialized.  I think that gives a good explanation of where I'm at, but I'll do my best to clarify if needed in future edits. Again, nothing here is intended to actually trivialize either the Holocaust or the Armenian genocide, or to express anything negative toward either Jews or Armenians - just addressing the reactions I've seen from young adults to certain historical topics. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Knowing that your family was exterminated because people hated them that much for being Jewish is a pretty terrible thought to grow up with as a Jew, and trauma and stress about something actually can be passed from generation to generation. Not to mention, neo-nazis and the like still exist - Jewish people all over the world are still discriminated against to large degrees, and since our worst case scenario already happened, we feel like we have to be cautious at all times and remind people that what happened was serious and had long-lasting impact that still isn&amp;#39;t healed (there are still a lot less Jews than there were before the Holocaust, for example). In many Jewish people&amp;#39;s eyes, even young Jews, the world has already proven to us that it wants us dead. Why wouldn&amp;#39;t we be sensitive about one of the worst things to happen to our people while anti-semitism continues to be on the rise all over the world? I have been told personally to get in the shower, that I should be put in a concentration camp, etc just for existing as a Jewish person (who isn&amp;#39;t even religious), so people out there are still literally wishing that the Holocaust happened to me. I think many Jews see this similarly and that&amp;#39;s why I think we are so sensitive to it. Because technically, is does still have an effect on us, whether it&amp;#39;s through loss or anti-semitic harassment and attacks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Links on antisemitism being perpetuated today: &lt;a href=""http://tabletmag.com/scroll/189243/study-anti-semitism-on-the-rise-at-u-s-colleges""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/05/antisemitic-attacks-uk-community-security-trust-britain-jewish-population""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=""http://www.religionnews.com/2014/05/13/survey-one-four-globally-infected-anti-semitism/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Note how in the last link, it says that 46 percent of the people polled have either not heard of the Holocaust or think it is a myth and/or exaggerated. I would say that&amp;#39;s a major reason to want to continue talking about it and being sensitive about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many(Jewish) baby boomers in the US grew up with parents that were literally the only survivors in their family.  Can you really say that your family history consisting of &amp;quot;my parents (or grand parents)  came here and everyone they new and loved from before than suffered in the hands of the nazis&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t effect you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I do not think trans-sexuality should be part of the gay rights movement. CMV.,"This is a bit of a frightening thing to post because people get very, very defensive about this sort of topic, and understandably so.  I would like to start by saying that I am a gay rights activist. I have participated in protests, days of silence, and voted on all the pro-gay legislation I could. I have plastered my town in signs to vote ""Yes"" on gay marriage, and even defaced anti-gay displays (not that this in **any way** legitimizes me. The anecdote is provided for understanding of my views.) But I've never really accepted the ""T"" in the LGBT community.  I am proud that a community could band together to support a group which faces discrimination and ostracization from the world at large. I'm not condemning the decision to defend a group of people who need defending. But I don't think trans-sexuality should be encouraged.   From my point of view, the entire idea of the gay rights movement, and by larger extension the LGBT community, is to accept who you are. It asks you to accept yourself and to accept others as they were made, and to end judgement based on arbitrary terms like sexual preference or gender roles. That is why I want to fight for this community, to see more people happy and accepting themselves. Gay or not.  But I don't feel like trans-sexuality is self acceptance. I think it is self denial in the most extreme form. We cannot, scientifically, turn a man into a woman, or the reverse. We can remove organs. We can alter the shape and appearance of genitals. We can provide hormones which impart characteristics of a gender. But none of this truly changes a sex. Your given sex affects the development of your brain, which is something you couldn't change with all the surgeries in the world. So shelling out huge money and undergoing major biological changes just to chase the idea of the other side, it doesn't seem healthy to me. It seems like the ultimate denial. And I don't think we should be acting like it's an alternative to loving yourself for who and how you are naturally.  I don't hate trans-gendered people and I don't want them to be treated unequally. They deserve love and compassion as much as anyone else. But I think we're doing a grave disservice by promoting it as a regular sort of thing. It is, undeniably, very unnatural. And it far overextends the boundaries of sexuality which LGB is literally named for.   **In summary:** I don't understand why the practice of extreme bodily mutilation/manipulation gets mixed in which a stance on sexuality. I shouldn't have to support something which I think is totally misguided in order to support a civil rights movement that I think is just. I obviously mean no offense to people who were born a non-binary gender. This complaint is about the deliberate decision to make a binary gender an artificial version of the other and my supposed responsibility to defend it.  I'm pretty set in my ways on this. But I'm inviting you to come try to **CHANGE MY VIEW.**  Edit: The use of ""Sex"" instead of ""Gender""  Edit 2: My view already got changed, guys! That was pretty dang fast.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;But none of this truly changes a sex. Your given sex affects the development of your brain, which is something you couldn&amp;#39;t change with all the surgeries in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gay men have brains a bit more like women, and it&amp;#39;s possible that transgender individuals have this to an even greater extreme. I can most likely provide a citation for the first fact, if you want.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Further, you&amp;#39;re overlooking one thing: the gender dysphoria is also part of who they are, and there is no &amp;quot;cure.&amp;quot; As confusing as it may seem, sometimes people have contradictory natures. For example, some people want to be singers, but never learned proper pitch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transgender individuals are inseparable from the LGB movement because they&amp;#39;re almost invariably going to identify as being attracted to members of the sex they publicly identify as at one point during their life--either before or after transitioning, if not at both points. It&amp;#39;s not a matter of &amp;quot;why should they get to be part of our movement,&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s a matter of &amp;quot;they&amp;#39;re either already part of our movement when they figure out that they&amp;#39;re trans*, or they&amp;#39;re going to be after they figure it out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, the whole &amp;quot;men and women are inherently different, just accept how you were made, you&amp;#39;re deluding yourself&amp;quot; schtick is pretty much the same rationale used by ex-gay organizations, opponents of gay marriage, and most of the other people the LGBT movement spends the vast majority of their time fighting.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Oh, and brain-wise? You&amp;#39;re right, there are some distinct differences between the brains of men and women. &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism#Brain_structure""&gt;And recent research has shown that, in many of the cases they&amp;#39;ve been able to study, pre-transition transgender individuals&amp;#39; brains are already structurally more similar to the gender they want to transition to than the gender they were born as/assigned.&lt;/a&gt; What you&amp;#39;re pointing at as proof that transgender individuals are &amp;quot;in denial&amp;quot; is arguably evidence of the opposite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: A teenager can be just as intelligent as an adult (on certain topics) because age and experience don't equal intelligence.,"Okay so this is an argument I have all the time, being a teenager myself (17). usually what happens is I'll be discussing a topic with an adult (usually a family member or teacher), then we disagree, then they say something that infuriates me like ""oh I thought the same thing when I was your age"" or ""you'll grow out of it.""  even online, there is this annoying stigma that all teens are idiots but at the same time think they know everything.   sometimes, it makes sense. some subjects obviously require experience. Relationship advice, for example. I've never been in a relationship so if I were to try and give an adult, or anyone for that matter, relationship advice, it would make sense to tell me ""you're too young""/""your opinion will change""/""you'll grow out of it"".   but when arguing about politics, religion, or any subject that really doesn't require experience to understand it better, saying something like ""you're just a teen"" or ""I used to think like that"" is an excuse and it usually means you have nothing more to say but aren't willing to ""lose"" this discussion to a stupid teen.    personally I'm, unsurprisingly, an atheist. I come from a semi-religious Jewish family. me and my dad have this argument ALL THE TIME. you know the one. and it almost always ends with me bringing up an extremely valid point and him laughing and saying ""oh its just a phase. you're just a teen. you're so young. you have no idea."" it fucking pisses me off.   A teenager can argue about politics or religion just as well as a 25 year old can and just as well as a 50 year old can. it only depends on the person and how much they are willing to put into learning about the subject.    _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It doesn&amp;#39;t mean they&amp;#39;re stupid, or that an adult automatically knows way more, just that adults are much more likely to have more relevant experience in any area (than a 17 year old).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how I would try to put it: lets assume two people are living in a country without war nor major strife and lets assume they are both reasonably intelligent.  One is, say 17, and the other is, say 30.  I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say that you can discard the first, what, 14/15 or so years of life?  The years where you are learning how to not shit your pants, how to color in the lines, how to interact socially, and specifically, learning how to learn.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So what does a 17 year old have? Two, maybe three years of reasonable life/world experience?  How many does a 30 year old have?  15/16?  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It doesnt make the 30 year old &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; smarter/more intelligent/more wise than the 17 year old, but the odds of that being true are absolutely in the older person&amp;#39;s favor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Try talking to someone that&amp;#39;s 12 or 13.  You can get a feel for just how narrow and limited their world view is and how naive they are in so many aspects.  That doesn&amp;#39;t really change as you grow older.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t your entire post based on your personal experience? If we take that away from your argument here, what do you really have left?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But seriously. Experience tends to have a tempering effect on information that can often be difficult to quantify. Just as you&amp;#39;ve arrived at your own point of view on experience (through your experience), events change the way we can view identical information. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If someone researches loss for instance, it may be easy to develop an academic view of the subject, but that knowledge does not confer what the actual experience of loss is like, or how difficult it can be to deal with. In the same way that knowing how to lose weight doesn&amp;#39;t often translate into success with losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The greatest benefit my own experience has conferred on me is a great awareness of what it&amp;#39;s like to be wrong. I&amp;#39;ve been wrong about a lot. It has gradually made me less and less certain over the years and so I&amp;#39;m a lot less concerned than I once was about whether or not I&amp;#39;m right. It also tends to make me more open to being wrong, so if someone points out a flaw in my reasoning I&amp;#39;m quicker to give up my old point of view in favor of seeing things differently.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A study conducted by Richard West at James Madison University found that contrary to what one might expect, people who scored very high on SATs or other standardized methods of evaluating cognitive or collegiate ability had a surprising vulnerability to certain kinds of test questions, such as:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A bat and ball cost a dollar and ten cents. The bat costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While our initial thought might be that the ball costs ten cents, this is actually incorrect. The correct answer is that the bat costs a dollar and five cents and that the ball costs five cents.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Intelligent people, Richard West found, were more prone to relying on heuristics (or mental short cuts) to solve problems and that this made them MORE likely than the average person to be vulnerable to certain cognitive biases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In some instances, it is the very clarity with which we see that world that is our biggest barrier to seeing it accurately. This is where experience is most helpful. It&amp;#39;s not just having the book knowledge that is important. It&amp;#39;s having the relevant life experience that brings that knowledge into its full three dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As your own arguments have developed, you&amp;#39;ve become frustrated with the ability of others, who often may not argue well. This would likely not have developed had you not honed your own skills through direct experience. At your age you&amp;#39;ve likely not honed these skills as far as you will at some point either. In other words, as skilled as you feel at developing your arguments now, you&amp;#39;ll be better in a year. Even better than that in two or three. You can&amp;#39;t help it. You&amp;#39;ll have a greater well to draw from then, just as you have a greater well to draw from now than you did a couple years ago.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of this isn&amp;#39;t in defense of those who dismiss your arguments out of hand as a result of their prejudice about your age. That&amp;#39;s a failing on their part. But just because others aren&amp;#39;t fair with you in terms of acknowledging the validity of your arguments on their face value doesn&amp;#39;t mean that experience isn&amp;#39;t a relevant factor in deepening understanding of all kinds of things. Knowing the depth of how wrong we can be, experiencing it personally and relevantly, does temper (rightly so) the convictions we hold deeply, and (applied well) lessens our hold on the truths we think we have a handle on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: Being ""door-prized"" is the fault of the cyclist, and cyclists should ride out of the range of doors.","Before I start, I don't believe the above in all cases. Here are my two exceptions where I feel it is the fault of the door-opener:  1. When the driver or passengers leave the vehicle when it is not in a proper parking spot. This is an illegal time to open the door anyway. I've seen videos taken in New York of Taxi passengers being like ""this is the best spot to get out, even though my Taxi is still in the middle of the road"", and then BAM. Door prize. This is the passenger's fault.  2. When the driver opens the door into a **marked** bike lane (without ensuring it is safe to do so). Note: if the bike lane is positioned correctly, it should never be within the door range of a parked car anyway, so this situation *should* never exist, but in reality it sometimes does exist. In the situations where it does exist, I think that since the driver had to safely cross a **marked** bike lane to park their car, it should be incredibly obvious that they need to be careful when opening their door on the way out. That's why in this situation I think it's the fault of the door-opener.  Now on to my arguement. First off, I do cycle on the road in a decent size city from time to time (I used to do it full time), so I am sympathetic to the plights of cyclists. I'm not just an ignorant driver yelling from my spot of comfort.  (When I do ride, I feel like I ride in a very safe, patient, predictable fashion. For example, I don't pass by cars stopped at intersections because I don't feel that it is reasonable for them to be expected to see me. I'll sit directly behind them in line with their license plate, and I'll let them do what they are doing without me making an erratic, sudden, unexpected pass. If I can't get directly behind them, I'll still let them turn right or left or whatever without darting in front of them or near them. Cars have many blind spots and motorists can't be reasonably expected to check all of them all the time as well as monitor what's in front of them *while* making a turn. Not even the best, most-attentive driver in the world could do so. Therefore, I ride the way I do not only to keep myself safe, but to make life easier and less stressful on motorists. We're all in this together.)  Door-prizing is probably the best example of cyclists having an attitude like ""People have to watch out for me in *blank* situation! I'm not at all going to help them not make a mistake in *blank* situation just because I'm not legally required to do so even though I could make the same mistake if I was them."". I understand how in the law it is written that a motorist must always open their door only when it is safe to do so. However, I do not agree with this law as I do not feel that is it reasonable to blame a driver for opening his or her door into the path of a cyclist. Here's why:  1. Even the best, most attentive driver can miss a cyclist that is riding close enough to be door-prized. You can shoulder check, mirror check, or whatever. If a cyclist is within only a few feet of that side of your car and coming fast, then they can be difficult to see until it's too late. This is especially true if they are riding parallel with your driver side tires when you are making your checks and then they suddenly turn out to go around you when you go to open the door.  2. Pedestrians are expected to cross at crosswalks. Why?  Because a driver can't be expected to monitor for pedestrians that are crossing at every part of the road from every direction, so we put the crosswalks at certain parts of the roads so that the drivers know where to expect pedestrians. Similarly, it's just as reasonable to say, ""cyclists, it is illegal for you to ride in the range of the doors because it's not reasonable for drivers to expect you to be on simply any part of the road you want. You have to be where they expect traffic. They don't expect traffic right next to them when they are parked.""  3. The cyclist, for their own safety, should not be riding in range of the doors. They are doing something incredibly dangerous by riding in the door range of parked cars. If someone is doing something incredibly dangerous, and someone hurts them as a result, then often the person who hurts them should not be held at fault. I feel this is one of those situations.  4. Door-prizing a cyclist is a mistake anyone can easily make, and it's **much** easier to teach the cyclist not to ride in the door-prize lane than it is to teach the driver to ensure that every single time they open their door they need to spend the 2 to 3 seconds to do their best to make sure no cyclist is about to dangerously pass them (even if the driver is preoccupied, in a rush, distracted by a child wanting to get out of the car, etc.). Keep in mind you're not just teaching drivers, you'd have to teach children too because anyone can be opening one of the doors on that side of the car. Also, I think you'd be dishonest with me if you say that every single time you open your car door you are 100% aware of what's next to you. You're lucky that there was never an irresponsible cyclist those times that you did.   Finally a cyclist might argue ""sometimes I need to cycle in the 'door-prize lane' because there's not enough room for cars to pass me if I ride further to the left"". In that situation you should simply ""take the lane"", which means that you ride in the centre of the lane so cars cannot pass you. This is 100% legal; you are still riding as far to the right as is safe to do so. If there are cars parked along the side of the road, then the traffic on that road is likely slow enough that you will have little trouble ""taking the lane"". If cars need to pass and you'd prefer to not have them sit behind you, you can move over into the ""door-prize lane"" and **stop** and wait until it's reasonable to move into the regular traffic lane again.  **EDIT:** Thanks for your opinions everyone. I gotta go to sleep. Some of you made some good points and caused me to rethink my opinion, see new flaws in my opinion, and see how that there are situations where my opinion is bullshit  (NYC, Large British Cities), but I still think my opinion is the more perfect of the two imperfect solutions (i.e. always blame the door-opener or blame the door opener in certain situations only). Also, I'm not so douchy and opinionated in normal life, just for you guys :P  **EDIT 2:** I'm not conceding my opinion! However, a PSA: please be careful when opening your door. You are also legally responsible if you open your door in a parking stall when if someone pulls in next to you. I think The Netherlands trains drivers to open their door with their right hand so that they are forced to turn around when they open it. Might be a worthwhile habit pick up!  **EDIT 3:** Because I like hearing my own voice. Cyclists: You can take the lane. I'm surprised by the number of people who don't know this.  Just because motorists have to slow down for you that doesn't mean you are doing something illegal. Take the lane if to do otherwise is to ride in an unsafe position on the road. Here's an excellent reference: [LINK](http://www.bikexprt.com/streetsmarts/usa/). Pay particular attention to [LINK](http://www.bikexprt.com/streetsmarts/usa/chapter2a.htm). Don't hesitate to inconvenience drivers *if* *to* *do* *otherwise* *is* *to* *compromise* *your* *safety*. I'm not saying go out of your way to be an asshole, just know that your safety is more valuable than someone else saving a few seconds. Regardless, motorists should be patient. They have a nice comfy seat and nice tunes in a nice warm, dry car. They can wait a second or 30 if it means you are safe. If they honk, ignore it. If they get out of their car, pedal away. If they pull out a gun, holy shit. (I'm speaking as someone who is both a cyclist and a motorist. I'm not just a douchy cyclist who feels they are entitled to the road.)  **EDIT 4:** I made some points in the comments that I think are very effective in explaining why I think the way I do. I'm going to put them here:  * The hazard of riding near parked cars is incredibly obvious to the cyclist but the hazard of opening the car door is not so obvious to the door-opener because of human nature and what we are taught.  * The cyclist has more control over where he/she rides than we have control over our occasional forgetfulness (or ignorance), especially while doing something as innocent to our brain as opening a door, no matter how hard we try or how responsible and cautious of a person we are.  * The cyclist is **knowingly and deliberately** doing something that is well-understood to be quite dangerous when there are alternatives (even if you are forced into the ""door-lane"", you can always ride slowly there or even come to a stop if that's what it takes to ride safely), while the door-opener is **unknowingly and accidentally** doing something dangerously that 99.99% of the time is safe and harmless.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You have a neck that lets you turn your head.

CMV: I think that the view of Americans as lazy people who don't want to travel is unfair. I believe that traveling within the USA counts because it is so large and varied.,"My dad is an anthropologist so I am fairly ""well traveled"". Every time I travel (mostly to Europe) someone tells me that they don't understand how Americans can spend their whole life in one country, how silly it is that we don't go see the world. Like it's some kind of easy choice.  The only countries that touch the USA are Canada and Mexico. Canada is very similar to the US, imho, though it is fun to travel and see the minor differences. Mexico is a whole different world, and not one that I really enjoyed. If you want to travel somewhere else, you have to fly, which gets very expensive very fast.  Also, sometimes I feel like many Europeans really don't understand how large the USA is. I drove from Dusseldorf to Amsterdam just to go to a party. Then a bunch of friends met me in Mons, Belgium to check out a festival that was going on. It's about a 5 hour drive total, and I hit 3 countries.   Right now I live in Miami, if I drove north for 5 hours I would hit Jacksonville. I wouldn't even leave my state. It's a 22 hour drive for me if I want to go to Mexico. That would be just to get to the border. It would take 24 hours to get to Canada.  TL;DR I think that many Europeans don't understand how hard it is to travel from the USA and see the world.  **Edit: Thank you everyone for your comments, my view was changed.

For people from these countries it is practically an obligatory thing for them to live and travel around Europe for a year or two in their early twenties. They call this their overseas experience. Americans could easily do the same thing but they choose not too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say laziness is probably a factor. Ignorance is probably a much bigger one though. Statements about the US being culturally varied are ridiculously ignorant. They ignore the cultural variety that exists in similarly homogenous countries like the UK and France. And they ignore countries where the cultural variety is many times that of the US like South Africa or India. (Where they speak tens of languages and have many different cultures and traditions.) The view of America being culturally diverse is largely caused by Americans lack of travel so it&amp;#39;s a self sustaining cycle. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another factor is, of course, Americans lack of paid time off of work. 2 weeks is ridiculous. But again, this could be remedies by the &amp;#39;overseas experience&amp;#39; that Australians and Kiwis do. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of traveling is interacting with different cultures. In Europe for example Romania is roughly the size of Oregon, but the surrounding countries all speak different languages, have different customs, different economies, different traditions. While America might take up more land, it&amp;#39;s relatively culturally homogeneous. Trying to see things from a different perspective is difficult and can result in aggression, or arguments. Americans are surrounded by roughly the same culture (with pockets of other customs and beliefs) so being met in an environment where traveling the distance of a state results in a huge difference in people, language, customs, is jarring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: I want to leave America and move to another country, because I hate the direction I think we're moving in, and I want to get out now.","I'm from the south in the United States, and I'm so sick of all the apathy that I see in my country. Our government has been handed to us on a silver platter of voting, yet year after year we elect the same fucking two parties that seem bent on destroying our national credit and stuffing the pockets of the elite in our society.  The people that would benefit from electing an independent party member for a change FAR outnumber the people sending their millions to superPACs, but because people can't be bothered to read a few articles about what's going on in our country, the same shit is happening year after year.  And that's not even the worst part. Most people seem to have this idea that America is number one in literally every category ever, so there's zero need to change any policies at all. The economy? phhbbbbtttt. It'll fix itself, we're on top, motherfuckers. Oh, drones are raining down missiles on school children in Afghanistan? They were probably at a suicide bombing camp anyway. Huge, multinational corporations are getting tax breaks while the middle and poorer classes have their incomes stolen to pay for it? Whatever, one day I'll be rich and won't have to worry about it.  It's at the point for me where I have zero national pride and just want to leave. This can get very expensive though, and I would genuinely appreciate anyone who can re-inspire some hope. Looking forward to it!  **EDIT #1:** Many people on this post have argued that it's better to stay and fight for your beliefs, than it is to give up and try to find greener pastures. That it's better to change things however you can, so that everyone benefits. And I think that's true, I don't see a better motivator than the greater good. BUT, moving to another country only involves me. A point I neglected to mention is that I'm worried about my own safety, not just the future of the entire country. I don't want to go to prison. There are articles WAY too frequently about wrongful execution, people going to jail for drugs, and just generally the hammer of justice coming down way too hard on people. Locking someone in a cage shouldn't be a standard, thoughtless punishment. I mean jesus, *the only people who went to jail after our economy crashed were the people protesting it during Occupy Wallstreet!* (as far as I know, no responsible executives were held accountable) I think I would rather save myself, if it comes down to it, than go to prison for taking a stand.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

So look for something you can do and like-minded people with whom you can do it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an American expat, I have some personal experience on this matter. One thing you have to think about is how much national problems affect you personally. Some things, like wage disparity, health insurance coverage, and taxes do impact you personally, but foreign policy, military spending, and corporate tax breaks don&amp;#39;t necessarily affect you on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You also have to consider your future in the new country.  What will you do?  Can you pursue the same career or find a new one?  Will you make enough money to live comfortably?  Wages in the US are still higher than most of the world, and Americans still enjoy a higher standard of living.  For example, I work full time as an English teacher in a big universtiy.  I make about 15,000 a year, and my salary is significantly higher than average for a native English teacher in my area.  While some things are cheaper, like rent, other things, like clothes, electronics, and food, are more expensive.  Overall, the standard of living is significantly lower, and most people live month to month, paycheck to paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Aside from finances, changing to a new country involves a lot of personal sacrifice.  Leaving friends and family behind is tough, and forging new friendships and relationships can be challenging, especially if there&amp;#39;s a language barrier.  Culture shock is real, and you&amp;#39;ll learn to appreciate some things about American culture that you had taken for granted before.  Overall this can be a positive experience.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After I&amp;#39;ve reflected on my comments, depending on where you are in your career, I would recommend that you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; leave the country for a short time.  Maybe do a stint in Asia or Latin America teaching English for a year.  It&amp;#39;ll give you new insights into what is really good and bad about America.  It&amp;#39;s valuable work and life experience, &lt;strong&gt;BUT&lt;/strong&gt; don&amp;#39;t burn any bridges back to the US.  File your taxes (you probably won&amp;#39;t have to pay anything, as taxes are 0 until like 96K), keep your passport up to date, and maintain your citizenship, you never know when you might want to or need to go back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: As an environmental engineer, I give up! PLEASE CMV!","Greetings  I am an environmental engineer, with a degree in environment and land management. I have studied and dedicated my professional life to make a change on our world, to make this planet a better place for future generations and protect it from those that would exploit it for greed and short term gain.  After 15 years of working in the field I am ready to give up. The fact is most people don't give a shit about our planet and the legacy we are leaving for future generations. I have worked hard, sometimes more than 70 hours a week, to see all that I have accomplished destroyed by short sighted corporations and the uncaring government that work for them.  I have been called a useless hippy who works only to stifle profits, I have seen the depths of which government and corporations will go to fuck us all for short term gains and I have lived for many years barely breaking even and financially keeping myself afloat because most environmental jobs that aren't about exploiting the system to maximize a companies profits pays for shit.  Well now I have a wife, a son, banks who are hounding me night and day to pay back my student loans and the dream of offering a better life for my family. This week I have been offered two new career opportunity. One is to manage a non profit organisation dedicated to protecting the last vestiges of forests and wetlands around the city i live in (while paying only 13$/h). The other is for a big construction company, to make sure that it is compliant with the pathetic environmental regulations while it bulldozes over the last natural ecosystems we have (but for more money per month than I ever made in a year)  I am to give my decision next week and I am truly considering for the first time in my life to give up my principals and go work for the money. I need somebody to change my views, but I am so tired of living poor, of not being respected and of seeing all my work be for nothing.  Edit: Wow I am getting finger cramps from replying to all of these great posts (very few of them were not so great ... you know who you are!) I sincerely thank you all for contributing to this great discussion. I have made this post as a whimsical experiment... I have already discussed about my career choice with my wife and close family and I have already come to a decision considering what to do with my immediate future. I just wanted to anonymously find out what the reddit community thought about my hard decision and I have been more than happily suprised with the response. This is the essence of what makes reddit so great... Many thanks to all of you... I will continue to respond to as many comments as I can and tomorrow I will update this post with my final decision and the reasons why I chose it.     Final decision Edit: First I would like to thank you all for this awesome CMV. It went way beyond what I had ever expected and I don't think I have ever spent so much time typing since my time at university. Like I said in the previous edit, I had already reached a decision by consulting my wife, my friends and my family, but all the incredible advice and the insightful comment gave me great hope that my decision will be the right one for my career, myself and my family. So here it goes  I have decided to take the construction industry job for the following reasons:  - Right now it is an awful time to be working in the non-profit NGO, where I live. The conservative government has slashed all funding in the environment sector and the provincial government only cares about austerity. If I took the NGO job, I wouldn't even be guarantied to be able to keep it for very long if the meager funding dries out.  - I have been working in the same field, with the same people for over 15 years. I am feel enthusiastic about learning new things and working with new people. Also if I learn the inner workings of the construction industry, I may become much more efficient to enact long term meaningful changes.  - I have been living poor (well much more then most engineer do) for the past 15 and I still have some student loans to reimburse. Banks have constantly been picking at my heels and it will be quite a load of my stress, if I can finally repay then and make then STFU! Also having some form of financial stability would be great for a change.  - Although where I live, our society has quite the safety net and I am assured that my child will never lack of his basic needs whatever salary I make, It would be great to offer my family a better quality of life. Rest assured I am not someone who will have more money go to his head. By nature, I am not a great consumer and I am very likely to put most of my money aside for personal projects and even help out the NGO I had worked for and respect.  - I have dedicated my entire life to fight for the environment and that in not about to change, even if I work in a different field. Over the years I have found that enacting change from the outside of a system is next to impossible, so it will be quite interesting to see if change can be had from the inside.   - My greatest fear is that the construction job asks me to compromise to much on my value and that makes me fall into a depression. In order to prevent this scenario, I will be following the advice given by many of you. Quickly put money aside, so I can safely bail out if thing get to rough and have multiple contingency plan if ever it does.   - Finally I must admit that the money does sound attractive. I never had a job that pays so much and I never thought I would. However having grown in a wealthy (relatively speaking) family, I know first hand that money doesn't buy happiness, it just makes misery very comfortable. Since I am a woodsman and love working outdoors comforts aren't that important to me, but it's been forever since I have dreamed of visiting the different forests around the world and for the first time in my life, I may actually be able to do that (If I ever get some vacation time... a concept that is equally alien to me)   Once again many thanks to all the people who commented on my CMV post (yes even the trolls, their idiotic antics proved somewhat entertaining) I wish you all the very best of luck in your endeavours and if anyone wants to help me in my quest to make this world a better place, feel free to go out an plant a tree. In the long run it does actually make a difference. Ardaron9 out!         Tldr: CMV really worked and I no longer believe that going to work for a big construction company is a huge betrayal of my environmental values. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I believe that addiction is just personal weakness. CMV.,"I believe that addiction (psychological or physical) is just something brought about by personal weakness. It seems to me that addiction to something like cigarettes or alcohol is brought upon oneself. You may have cravings for something, but that doesn't mean you have to indulge it.   I understand that something similar to an addiction can occur when used for pain, etc. but that once the problem is gone, there is no reason to continue it. In the case of chronic pain, I don't consider non-abusive use an addiction.  So CMV. I want to hear what you guys have to say about addiction.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having an understanding of reward pathways of the brain I think is the best way to realize that the concept of being &amp;#39;weak willed&amp;#39; is not very meaningful when it comes to addiction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Addictive drugs work on the older parts of our brain (evolutionarily speaking). These older areas (primarily the nucleus accumbens, various other aspects of the limbic system) are in control of reward responses and survival instincts. Addictive drug use rewires the brain into thinking &lt;em&gt;you will die&lt;/em&gt; without drugs. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you get a rodent addicted to a drug and give it a bar to push to get a dose of drugs, it will press the bar until it dies. Read that a few times and let it sink in. The rodent won&amp;#39;t care about food or water. It&amp;#39;s brain will just signal to engage in drug-seeking behavior until the drugs stop coming or stop working.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Drugs act as signaling molecules in the brain, and send users into a feedback loop of use. Binge, withdrawal, binge to avoid withdrawal symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A different way of thinking about it: Hand someone a knife and tell them to stab it into their hand as hard as they can. If someone doesn&amp;#39;t take your offer, are they &amp;#39;weak willed&amp;#39;? I would hope you would say &amp;#39;of course not&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even though you&amp;#39;re entirely physically capable of stabbing yourself, every part of your brain will fight you. Your brain will say that the pain induced by ramming a knife into your hand is to be feared and avoided; and it&amp;#39;s the same brain systems involved with addiction that are informing a person to avoid that pain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The two are directly analogous to what your brain thinks when you tell it to stop using a drug. You may think rationally while not stressed by cravings &amp;quot;oh sure I can quit whenever I want&amp;quot;, just as you can think &amp;quot;oh I can ram a knife into my hand&amp;quot;, but in the moment the blade is against your skin, that rationality evaporates. You&amp;#39;re left with a survival impulse and not much more. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course you can override that response, hunger strikes being a good example of doing so. But to say that anyone who can&amp;#39;t force themselves to go on a hunger strike is &amp;quot;weak-willed&amp;quot; seems like setting the bar far too high on what it means to have strong will. I hear strong will and I think refusing ice cream or pizza. Or getting myself to the gym. Yes, those responses are still tied up in the reward centers of your brain, but it&amp;#39;s internally driven; addictive drugs work generally can cross the blood-brain barrier and work directly to push your reward system into overdrive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t find any of that convincing, I would hope you withhold such opinions prior to having direct first hand experience with addicts. Their lives are stolen from them. Many are as simultaneously desperate to get off their drug as they are to take another hit. It&amp;#39;s not a hole they&amp;#39;ve dug themselves, it&amp;#39;s quicksand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You realize people develop physical dependencies right? I mean partially addiction is always personal weakness, of course it&amp;#39;s always a conscious decision to feed an addiction, but the withdraw on certain drugs can be deadly. &amp;#39;Indulging&amp;#39; in a heroin addiction would be like &amp;#39;indulging&amp;#39; in chemo therapy or pain killers getting you wisdom teeth out. If kick addictions was truly just a matter of willpower, people wouldn&amp;#39;t go into prostitution to feed their addictions. People wouldn&amp;#39;t steal and pawn their families possessions to feed their addictions. I&amp;#39;ve never heard of a person kicking an addiction to hard drugs by themself, and frankly it&amp;#39;s really shitty to call people weak for not being able to.    &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: Heterosexual sex work is incompatible with gender equality,"Heterosexual sex work, i.e., the buying and selling of sex (more or less) is unique and unlike almost any other kind of work.   Men are the overwhelming consumers, and women are the overwhelming workers. There are exceptions, but they are less than 1%.   The buyer-consumer/seller-producer relationship is inherently unequal. The buyer-consumer has all the power, because he is the one who comes into the transaction with money. It is up to the seller-producer to perform. ""The customer is always right."" In labor transactions, the buyer-consumer is the equivalent of the boss/employer.  In ordinary forms of work, the seller-producer can ameliorate his or her powerlessness through achievement. Whether you are the inventor of the iPhone or you moped the floor, you used your abilities to achieve something and created value. Accomplishment is one of the core meanings of life that provide fulfillment.   In sex work, however, the focus of the end product is the body itself, which is the embodiment of the worker's existence, and not the result of her achievement (yes, hard work such as diet and exercise go into shaping the body, but they do not create the body).   **In summary**: Sex work is inherently sexed, with men cast as buyers and women as sellers. Buyers inherently have the power over sellers in economic transactions. The thing being sold by the sex worker is not her achievement but her consent to use her body. Hence, sex work is inherently unequal and privileges men while degrading women.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

There are exceptions, but they are less than 1%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Certainly, this division can&amp;#39;t be completely inevitable.  If it&amp;#39;s not inevitable, couldn&amp;#39;t the gendered division of buyers and sellers actually be the &lt;em&gt;result&lt;/em&gt; of a lack of gender equality?  Indeed, the underlying reason for the current situation is pretty simple: female sexuality is accorded value by society, while male sexuality is not.  That sexist double-standard creates a situation where sex is generally conceptualized as something women &lt;em&gt;give&lt;/em&gt; and something men &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; (usually in return for something else).  Naturally, this lends itself to a situation where virtually all prostitutes are women, because (by and large) women have sexual capital to sell and men don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because this all results from an underlying condition of gender inequality, your argument is actually circular: according to you, prostitution can&amp;#39;t coexist with gender equality because of its gender asymmetry, yet that gender asymmetry only exists because of a lack of gender equality in the first place.  In a theoretical situation with full gender equality, the gender asymmetry your argument is based on could quite easily not exist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I believe Microsoft Visual Studio 1998 runs rings around any current open source development environment.

I believe that profits of companies should be limited/regulated. CMV,"I believe that high profit margins in companies are a sign of corruption within the company. If a company is consistently making an extremely large amount of money compared to what they are spending, it shows that they are either A) charging their customers too much for the service or product they are providing (see Comcast), or they are B) not spending enough money on improving their service (see Comcast), or they are C) not competing fairly (see Comcast).  What do I consider ""profit""?  Profit = Revenue - Expenditure  Revenue is kinda obvious, so what do I consider Expenditure?  Expenditure is:  * Money spend on R&amp;D,   * employment costs  * Charitable donations (to approved non-profit organizations, research or medical centers)  * taxes  * investments in ""startup"" companies (could be classified under charitable donations; on the smaller companies end, investments would not count toward their total revenue)  * The other obvious stuff.   What's more important is what I *don't* consider expenditure. Expenditure is *not* :  * Bonuses (per 3 or 4 months) that are greater than 10% of the recipient's yearly salary  * Money lost through fines, settlements (like lawsuits), or other costs due to legal liability. This would discourage illicit activity as there will be greater consequences to larger companies than they are now. (I'm not rock solid on this one).   * Money spent on personal assets (i.e. gifts from the company).   * Unreasonably lucrative ""raises""  What kind of limitations and conditions will there be?   * Profit over a 5 year period cannot exceed 15% of revenue. That means if the company's revenue is $100, they will have to have an expenditure of $85. (Hourly services, such as performers  would be exempt or have different conditions).  * If the company has profits greater than 15%, but less than 30% of the total revenue, they can deposit the extra money into a ""rainy weather"" fund if the balance of the RW fund is less than 30% of the company's revenue for that time period (these are not really hard numbers, more of a concept). This would give smaller companies some wiggle room while they are growing.  * Penalty for ""unlawful"" amounts of profit: The government would confiscate these profits and distribute them equally among the population in the form of a tax break.   While the specifics may be way off base or poorly thought out, I believe this kind of system would be very beneficial to society and the economy. CMV by explaining why it is a fundamentally flawed concept!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s set aside Comcast for the moment, since it is a semi-monopoly in most places.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s consider a company that just made the best video game ever.  Why shouldn&amp;#39;t they be able to charge whatever they want for it? You don&amp;#39;t have to buy if you don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s worth it.  They can set the price lower to get more sales and lower profit or higher for more profit and fewer sales.  But either way, they will make what people want to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And then, seeing how much they made, another company comes in and invests to make an even better game.  And the same thing begins again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then, the first company goes back, invests a ton in a 3rd game, which completely bombs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Who is harmed by this process?  Nobody is screwed because they don&amp;#39;t have to buy the game.  We end up with not just one but two great games because of the profit motive.  The first company is able to survive the failure of game 3 because of the profits they made on game 1.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, in your scenario, the developer behind the game, who is working a boring job writing code for spreadsheet software takes a look and decides that it&amp;#39;s not worth the risk of quitting his job and spending a couple of years developing the killer game.  Or even if he does, company 2 decides that it&amp;#39;s not worth the investment for 15%.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, Comcast is another story.  As essentially a utility, I agree with regulating the bastards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;They already are by the market. If you&amp;#39;d rather that a company wasn&amp;#39;t that profitable, then you can stop purchasing their goods and services. If they make a product that you like at a price you&amp;#39;re willing to pay for, then their profit is justified. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a fundamentally flawed concept because what we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing is allowing for more competition in the market place &lt;em&gt;so that&lt;/em&gt; shitty companies aren&amp;#39;t able to continue making profits if they don&amp;#39;t sell good products/services. If a company is insanely profitable &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; a highly competitive marketplace, that means that the products they create are superior to that of competitors. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this type of scenario, there&amp;#39;s no reason to have a &amp;#39;cap&amp;#39; on profits because consumers and other companies get to decide.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, if Company A is making 75% profit, then perhaps company B can come along and do it for 50% profit. If company C sees a way to do it better, perhaps they can lower the COGS and offer the product at a lower price and a tighter profit margin of 35. Etc, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: Western visitors to Iran or North Korea who do anything that breaks laws deserve to end up in jail and their home governments should make it clear they won't support them.,"I sincerely doubt that anyone visiting Iran or North Korea is unaware of the strict enforcement that these countries mete out to foreigners attempting to demonstrate against or change an internal policy.  They know full well what they're getting into.  Bringing Christ's message to North Korea?  Jail. Want to change Iran's policies concerning women attending sports events?  Jail.  People who do this are either naive fools or are religious fools.  They bring potential harm to their home countries by providing a bargaining chip and advantage to the imprisoning governments.  Western governments need to make it clear to travelers to these countries that if they intentionally break laws or provoke the ""system"" they'll face dire consequences with no assistance from their home government.  edit: My CMV should have been this:  Western visitors to Iran and North Korea who knowingly provoke the regime should expect severe punishment and no assistance from their home government.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Even if they lived in said country. Now, imagine if instead of ignoring these laws exist, they abuse these obscure laws to trap foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Say officer X doesn&amp;#39;t like tourist Y. Officer X just saw tourist Y put a recyclable bottle in a non-recyclable trash can. This breaks some obscure law that no sane tourist would know of, but Officer X is a douchebag on a powertrip and now has the authority to make tourist Y&amp;#39;s life a living hell.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or the fact that these places are rife with corruption and they can just throw you in jail and find some bullshit charge to stick to you after the fact. Whether it was some obscure law, or a straight up lie that&amp;#39;s corroborated by their buddy. It could be as little as a wrong look towards the wrong person, or as much as trying to extort someone for money and said person not cooperating.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s the issue of humane punishment. Having your hand chopped off for stealing a candy bar, for instance, is a bit overkill. Sure, you shouldn&amp;#39;t be stealing candy bars, but permanently losing a limb in a gruesome manner is a bit much of a price to pay for a regrettable mistake. Punishments like these also generally involve people that don&amp;#39;t know the consequences of what they&amp;#39;re doing carry such harsh penalties in the places they are. What sane person would steal a candy bar if they &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; they&amp;#39;d lose their hand if caught?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of opportunity for abuse if your government doesn&amp;#39;t stand up for you. And I think you&amp;#39;ll find it a hell of a time to prove that someone went to a country to intentionally break a specific law. I think a lot of these cases arise out of naivety, ignorance, or corruption of some sort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The keyword in your CMV that I’m going to latch onto is the word “deserve”.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the punishments received by people in various countries are cruel to say the least. Often the degree of gruesomeness is hard or impossible to fathom for anyone who hasn’t experienced it. Others in the thread have already mentioned that people in Singapore (and Malaysia) receive caning (a form of torture) for some crimes. North Korea is the epitome of cruel and unusual punishment, placing people in concentration camps for the rest of their lives &lt;em&gt;and the next three generations after them&lt;/em&gt;, where they have insufficient access to food, no access to information, no entertainment, virtually no interaction with other prisoners, and virtually no free time from hard, slavelike physical labor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The view that you have expressed is that anyone who goes to a country and breaks one of its laws, even unknowingly or accidentally, &lt;em&gt;deserves&lt;/em&gt; this form of punishment, and the only reason you’ve stated for that is that one could have known beforehand what one was in for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you honestly believe that, then you shouldn’t mind if your home country also started administering such punishments, or you would be inconsistent. After all, here in the “western world”, we clearly lay out the fate that awaits anyone who breaks the law, so you always know what you’re in for when you commit a crime, right?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But you know that European and North American countries do not, in general, make use of such inhumane sentences. Why is that? It’s because their population (largely) believes that, as human beings, we &lt;em&gt;do not deserve&lt;/em&gt; certain kinds of treatment, &lt;em&gt;even after committing a crime&lt;/em&gt;. The kinds of gruesome punishments I’m thinking of are considered to be &lt;em&gt;in violation of human rights&lt;/em&gt;, and criminals are humans too. Logically, you don’t stop being a human when you go to another country, so it would be a double-standard to say that a certain punishment would be &lt;em&gt;deserved&lt;/em&gt; over there but not over here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, (most of) the population of (most) western countries believes this &lt;em&gt;even about criminals who have committed heinous acts against their fellow humans&lt;/em&gt;. Your CMV, however, is not even about heinous crimes, but about political activism and religious proselytization, both acts in which other humans &lt;em&gt;aren’t even being hurt&lt;/em&gt;. Any reasonable human being in their right mind would not consider a jail sentence to be a commensurate punishment for such an action, much less for it to be &lt;em&gt;deserved&lt;/em&gt;. The reason those governments jail you for it is because of political circumstances (e.g. corruption) and not because they really believe you morally &lt;em&gt;deserve&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"I think the studying the arts in high school does not help prepare students for the ""real world"" CMV","I am having this argument with a colleague of mine, he is the one that holds this opinion. He thinks that focusing solely on studying core classes such as mathematics, social sciences, and history is much more effective than wasting time with arts such as theater or music. He argues that the real world application of the core classes should be the only thing that is taught in schools as it is what gets you ""real jobs."" Thanks in advance and CMV","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, while I would agree that arts programs do not prepare students for the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; in the way your colleague is implying (unless they are planning on being artists), this isn&amp;#39;t a reason to cut arts from school. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Much of what we learn in high school does nothing to prepare us for the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; on the surface level unless you are specifically going to specialize in the subject. Most people don&amp;#39;t use mathematics past the middle school or even elementary school level. History normally isn&amp;#39;t that useful either in the future. A lot of careers do utilize English, but the large emphasis on literature is fairly unnecessary. Science might seem like it has a more concrete use, but not that many people pursue jobs that require the amount of science taught in high schools. Despite these reasons, you&amp;#39;re not just allowed to take whatever you feel is relevant to you and graduate in a couple years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;High school is not just about preparing yourself in a tangible way. It&amp;#39;s about exploring your options and trying to do the things you like while you have no real obligations. It&amp;#39;s about putting yourself in a mindset of learning and improvement. It&amp;#39;s about developing your social skills to interact with peers and superiors. It&amp;#39;s about absorbing and learning about culture. It&amp;#39;s also about finding direction in life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stripping arts from high school would deprive students of a channel to fulfill some of these goals. Now, it&amp;#39;s true that students can choose to pursue these activities outside of school, but many students are introduced to the arts through school or simply don&amp;#39;t have the resources outside of public education. It&amp;#39;s also true that other subjects have indirect positive effects (analyzing books improves critical thinking, history gives us context, we use both for cultural references, etc) but the same is true for arts (students who play music tend to do better on tests, arts are integral to our culture and many people would be quite miserable or even cannot live without them, etc).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real world application of the core subjects requires more than just the acquisition of knowledge, it requires the use of critical thinking, common sense and imagination, all traits of individuals. Study in the arts nurtures individualism i.e. self-expression and imagination, which are critical to developing new ideas from accumulated knowledge and experience as well as aiding in problem-solving, which is largely a creative skill. Furthermore participation in subjects such as music and theater help to develop cooperation and communication skills which cannot be learned nearly as well, if at all, in an academic class, and both skills are needed in abundance in order to make it in the real world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
I don't think we should really care what the original writers of a constitution thought. CMV,"I do not believe that the ""original intent"" of the writers of any constitution should matter in our modern interpretation of it. I live in Canada, so it is a little different, since some parts of our constitution are from 1867 and some are from 1982, but I think the same would apply to, for example, the US constitution. I believe a constitution is a guideline and a fundamental outline for a system of governance, establishing the basic rules under which it should function, but I believe that that definition should evolve with time and that the original intent, while having been important to the original writing, should not be important to the modern interpretation. For example, in Canada we have the ""living tree"" doctrine, in which the spirit of the Constitution rather than the literal text is considering to be more important. Although the Constitution does not mention sexual orientation, it has been considered to be a part of it by most of the legal system in recent years, because of that doctrine. The whole debate in the US about what the Founding Fathers would think of the world now just seems silly and stupid to me. Change My View.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First post on CMV, but US Constitutional Construction Theory is something I love, so thought I&amp;#39;d give it a try. Please note my entire comment will be pretty much based on US jurisprudence, as that is where my knowledge lies. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The whole debate in the US about what the Founding Fathers would think of the world now just seems silly and stupid to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I feel this sentence oversimplifies much of US Supreme Court jurisprudence. The debate is not so much about &amp;quot;what would the Founding Fathers do&amp;quot; (WWFFD?) but more about how much weight we should give to WWFFD. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The two sides of the debate are known as &amp;quot;Originalism&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;Living Constitution&amp;quot; movement, and correspond roughly to Conservative (Republican) and Liberal (Democratic) interpretations, respectively. &amp;quot;Originalism&amp;quot; seeks to interpret and apply law (in this case, the Constitution) based first and foremost on the writing itself, and secondly on any additional writings or other evidence contemporaneous with the writing. For example, originalist justices (like Scalia and Thomas) generally do not find a right of privacy stemming from the US Constitution, as the word &amp;quot;privacy&amp;quot; is never mentioned in the document itself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In contrast, the &amp;quot;Living Constitution&amp;quot; movement generally strays further from the original text, and seeks to take current conditions into account when interpreting the text. So using the &amp;quot;privacy&amp;quot; example from above, although the word &amp;quot;privacy&amp;quot; does not exist in the text of the Constitution or its Amendments, recent jurisprudence (of the last 50-75 years) has found a qualitative right of privacy protected by various provisions of the Constitution, most notably the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ironically, the &amp;quot;Living Constitution&amp;quot; movement tends to think more about the &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; of the Founders than the Originalists do. A Living Constitutionalist would say &amp;quot;If the Founders were alive today, dealing with the internet, what would they want for the US?&amp;quot; Originalists look only at the actual words of the Founders. But the Founders tend to exert more of an influence, so to speak, over the Originalists than over the Living Constitutionalists. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is the best argument in favour of thinking about the original intent of the writers -- it actually tends to lead to more progressive results because original &lt;em&gt;intent&lt;/em&gt; is used to interpret modern events, rather than allowing the words of 250 years ago to dictate our modern jurisprudence. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I suppose for me, interpreting the Constitution is pretty similar to interpreting any text: you can make whatever argument you want, provided you can find textual support for it. This is the number one rule of literary analysis from every literature class (English, Spanish and German) I have ever taken. The only difference is, the Constitution is the founding document of a country. It creates an entire socio-political system, a whole way of being. So interpreting it, trying to find textual support for your arguments, becomes exponentially more important. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a result, I believe we should definitely care what the authors thought. It maybe shouldn&amp;#39;t be the end-all and be-all of Constitutional interpretation (as the Originalists would have us believe) but the text, and any contemporaneous documents or accounts, should certainly be the starting point. Still, the Founding Fathers obviously couldn&amp;#39;t foresee many events that have happened since 1789, and so I ultimately fall on the &amp;quot;Living Constitution&amp;quot; side of the debate: how could they possibly have written or thought anything about the internet? But the spirit of their desires for their country, our country, can still be found in the text they wrote, and should be applied and considered when regulating the people of that country. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if we wrote a law today that was intended to do something, and it was interpreted a different way years later by people with a political agenda? When you debate and pass a law, you expect it to achieve a certain purpose and to have a very precise meaning (that&amp;#39;s why we always have so many lawyers nitpicking about the exact wording of statues). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It nullifies that entire debate and the democratic process as a whole if the meaning of that law can morph over time until it is unrecognizable to the original. This is not to say changes to the law should never happen, but they should be preceding by a new public discourse and formal revision. Doing otherwise would be essentially like breaking the rules of the democratic process. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thinking of the Constitution specifically, the Founding Fathers, for all their internal differences, had a much different collective vision for the country 200 years ago than we have today. The Constitution even included previsions for its own amendment if there was sufficient public support - so why not just do that if people truly want a change, rather than saying it is okay to change the meaning over time through a non-democratic process?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: The highest form of relationship between men and women doomed to be romance,"Maybe it has to do with being an adolescent and being new to dealing with the opposite sex, but I'm beginning to fall under the assumption that the only purpose for guys to get to know girls is to eventually engage in romance.   ""Why else do men engage women in conversation in public?"" I wonder (my perception might just be distorted after reading Neil Strauss's *The Game*). ""Why do I feel like chasing after girls and getting to know them when I have so many great guy friends already who I know care about me so much more? Why can't I be friends with girls (even pretty ones) and not feel insecure when I don't try to advance some romantic agenda? Why do I find myself inevitably becoming attracted to them?""   I have so many more questions regarding the non-romantic side of male-female relationships, but instead of writing an abhorrent block of text nobody could possibly be expected to read, I ask just the one title question (thinking that the above questions are more like fragments of a bigger picture of misunderstanding) because I want to know what older, more mature people think. It also must distort my view to have gone to an all-boy's school for the majority of my life.   At times, I feel like the interplay between men and women is always (at least always initially) a bs game where the man tries to show the woman how non-threatening and valuable he is from a non-romantic standpoint before she is comfortable with allowing herself to think of him as a safe partner. Something about that seems so sinister, cynical, and hollow to me that I can't stand it. Please change this view.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I think it&amp;#39;s due to your age, your minimal experience with romantic relationships, and the fact that you go to an all-boys school.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a lesbian. Nearly all of my friends are women. I&amp;#39;m also attracted to some of them. I&amp;#39;d probably date and/or fuck a few of them. But I compartmentalize as much as possible. I&amp;#39;m not friends with any of them because of their attractiveness - I&amp;#39;m friends with them because they are cool women and I like them as people. I have one friend that I&amp;#39;ve slept with in the past, and another that I had a crush on earlier this year. But I&amp;#39;ve put that aside and now I only see them as friends.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think your views will change as you get older and as you get more experience spending time with women in various situations. This will help you see women as people first, instead of potential romantic prospects. Look, I know what it&amp;#39;s like. For me personally, I know that I will almost always develop a crush on a woman that I&amp;#39;m attracted to if I spend a lot of time with her. But since I understand that&amp;#39;s my natural tendency, I&amp;#39;m able to ignore it if I know that no romance/sex is going to happen. So because I continue treating her as a friend, that&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;ll think of her. If I only liked her as a potential romantic prospect, then I&amp;#39;ll know that and I won&amp;#39;t try to develop a friendship.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;tl;dr: women are people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, first off, there&amp;#39;s the fact that most people aren&amp;#39;t interested in romance with family members of the opposite sex, but I figure you&amp;#39;re excluding that. So, here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve experienced as a 19-year-old male college student.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A lot of the times, yes, women and men do interact in a romantic way, one trying to impress the other to get involved in romance. It happens. There are a lot of great, good-looking people out there. Jeez, my college is known for being the land of partying, gorgeous college people. But romance just isn&amp;#39;t as cut and dry as that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The one thing I&amp;#39;ve learned about life and romance going through high school and college? There is no manual. None. And we try to define all of these interactions between the sexes as one thing or another because it&amp;#39;s easy. But it really isn&amp;#39;t. I can think a girl is absolutely gorgeous and still be friends with them, mostly because I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;s the one for me. That doesn&amp;#39;t devalue them, just because I don&amp;#39;t feel like I want to keep someone exclusively to myself doesn&amp;#39;t mean I care for them any less. And just trying to be romantic with women, assuming the endgoal of any compatible people is romance, completely cuts out some of the most beautiful times you can have with people. I&amp;#39;ve taught a friend how to drive, letting her find a passion in a shitty life. I&amp;#39;ve spent countless all-nighters with a friend just shooting shit, due to insomnia and boredom. I&amp;#39;ve held a friend so close after she told me I was the biggest reason she hadn&amp;#39;t killed herself. I&amp;#39;ve watched stars fall on a hilltop so clear and beautiful as I called a friend a sister for the first time. So many interactions. So many beautiful, hard, wonderful, life-changing experiences I&amp;#39;ve had because of friendships with women. And it&amp;#39;s no harder than being a friend with a guy, because we seem to forget so many times that women are people too, they are sad, happy, lonely and joyful at times, just like us. So stop thinking about how it&amp;#39;s supposed to be done and just let things go on. If you want to be exclusive with a girl, go for it. But sometimes? Sometimes you love a person without needing to hold them close to you. Experience that, I beg you. Something as simple and beautiful as all that should never, ever be left unexperienced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I don't think being white gives me an *unfair* advantage (Or at least I shouldn't feel bad about having an advantage). CMV,"Right off the bat, let me say two things. I'm not racist (consciously; maybe I'll find out I am racist). When I say I don't have an ""unfair* advantage, I do not mean I deserve an advantage, I mean something else which I'll elaborate on.  So basically I've been told that I'm benefiting from racism (and that I should feel guilty because of it), and I think that's bogus. More so the part about me feeling guilty.  I recognize that being white puts me ahead of minorities in certain situations. Don't get me wrong, I definitely recognize that minorities deal with mistreatment or judgment that I just don't have to deal with. But I don't think I should feel guilty for being white, nor do I think I'm actually benefiting from being white in an objective way (I know this sounds confusing, bare with me).   Others are perhaps detriment-ed by not being white, but that's not actually an advantage for me. To elaborate further, racism causes minorities to be treated poorly, so in comparison to me, it appears that I have an advantage. But I'm not actually being treated better than I ought to be treated, the problem is others are being treated worse. Basically we should treat minorities the same as whites, not whites the same as minorities.   So when I say I don't have an objective advantage, I'm saying my advantage only exists when I'm competing against a minority (who is being treated unfairly). It's like saying runner #1 has an advantage because runner #2 hurt his knee.   What this boils down to is I don't think I should feel bad, and I don't think it's fair to say I'm actually benefiting from racism. Others are hurt by racism, but that's not automatically good for me.   I had nothing to do with america's racism. In fact everyone who actually participated in slavery is dead. I really think we should be done shaming people and telling people they should feel bad for being white. We should focus on eliminating racism, not redirecting it.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I should feel bad, and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s fair to say I&amp;#39;m actually benefiting from racism. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know anyone who would argue that individuals with privilege should &amp;#39;feel guilty&amp;#39; about their privilege. Feeling guilty doesn&amp;#39;t accomplish anything. What you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do (and it seems like your attitude is conducive to this) is work actively and consciously to correct and diminish racism/sexism/bigotry.    &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically we should treat minorities the same as whites, not whites the same as minorities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re absolutely correct. Because you&amp;#39;re part of the majority, you alone have the power to change this. Call your friends out on their racist jokes, report discrimination in the workplace, acknowledge that (even if &lt;em&gt;you&amp;#39;re&lt;/em&gt; not racist) that some people are and work to change that in whatever capacity you&amp;#39;re able. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No-one has any reason to feel guilty about injustice if they&amp;#39;re working toward change. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Others are perhaps detriment-ed by not being white, but that&amp;#39;s not actually an advantage for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Except for something competitive where someone else&amp;#39;s misfortune increases your own chances, such as, say, getting a job. Or getting into a college. Or getting a paper published. Or making First Chair in a professional orchestra. All told, it doesn&amp;#39;t really seem like you&amp;#39;re contesting this point, either.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to feel bad about it, and I don&amp;#39;t know where you got the impression that you should - just acknowledge the problem and do what you can, when you can, to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not the only problem in that category, either. I don&amp;#39;t have to &lt;em&gt;feel bad&lt;/em&gt; about American imperialism, despite the fact that it&amp;#39;s responsible for many thousands of deaths and I&amp;#39;ve directly benefited from it, but I should acknowledge it and take measures to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, if you don&amp;#39;t want to acknowledge the problem and/or want to do anything to fix it... &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; I would argue that you should feel bad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I believe that all teachers should be encourage to carry a handgun. CMV,"I live in Israel and at least in the area that I live (WB, I am not here to debate that though) after many terror attacks at schools many teachers started carrying handguns, this for example stopped the [Mercaz HaRav massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercaz_HaRav_massacre) and could have stopped the [Ma'alot massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma'alot_massacre).  This practice could help stop many school shootings around the world.  Schools can pay for the purchase of the weapons and pay for the shooting courses and basic security measures (safes).  I do not see any reason not to allow teachers to defend students if the need arises.  This can also help teachers defend themselves against violent students/paraents.  CMV","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a teacher. We have an armed police officer at my school, as is common. But that&amp;#39;s not going to stop a Columbine (they had at least one), nor would a few teachers with handguns probably. So I don&amp;#39;t see the point. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Background...I teach in a rough area. The school is safe, but many of the kids are likely to be targeted by gangs or have opportunities to join (many will but not the majority these days in the area). Some of my students are mentally ill but mainstreamed (bipolar, schizophrenic, etc). Some have violent tendencies. Heck, some teachers might. There are teachers with bpd that do good work still. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reasoning&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) My students see school ... Even with its flaws... as a place to escape major violence in many cases (not all violence, sadly). This proposition takes that away. I understand it&amp;#39;s an ideal, but we all deserve to feel not just protected by might but free of it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) school in America (and I&amp;#39;ve taught elsewhere) is too emotional. Teaching is emotional turmoil as is learning. Sure, police work is too but safety and defense is your primary focus there. It&amp;#39;s not the kind of thing you want to tack on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) defend against violent students or parents? Ha! I cannot even give people a piece of my mind, and I shouldn&amp;#39;t. It&amp;#39;s unprofessional to even THINK of such a thing and against our code of ethics. That idea rewrites basic ethics. Teachers would be sued. Period. It&amp;#39;s impractical. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4) cost. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;5) teachers are of better service in other ways during an emergency in most cases. (Law enforcement isn&amp;#39;t slow to these scenes. Hiding, spreading word, getting locked down... All will save more lives against someone who likely has more than a handgun themselves.) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;7) kids grabbing the gun. I know there are special holsters etc but eventually, it&amp;#39;s going to happen. Unlike the officer at my school, there is not a natural &amp;quot;space&amp;quot; given to me. I must build relationships. He must protect. He has the energy to watch his weapon at all times; no teacher has the extra focus energy for that, I&amp;#39;d imagine. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are probably other logical reasons too, but my biggest reason is just that I&amp;#39;d consider such a place a hostile environment to be in. Kids are forced to be there... Why make it more jail like? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple, and I know you are going to post &amp;quot;Myth #3&amp;quot; or whatever you have been posting but you need to see the difference in my point.  Lets say we arm teachers and school shootings stop (mainly through the deterrence, through which a definite number can not be calculated, but one or two through actually use of the firearm over the course of five years).  So we have that, now lets say you have 3 accidents with the weapons due to teacher negligence.  What is the media going to report on, surely the prevented school shootings, but the 3 accidents are more then just week long stories.  Why is this? because trials.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The accidents will have trials, you can&amp;#39;t just give teachers immunity for prosecution if the gun they are responsible for kills an innocent student due to their neglect, that would never be upheld by a court (sorry little johnny was killed because Mr. Suckswithguns thought it would be fun to play with what he thought was an unloaded gun while the students were testing, but because he&amp;#39;s a teacher he can&amp;#39;t be sued and you&amp;#39;ll just have to carry the burden of knowing that Johnny&amp;#39;s sacrafice made the world safer... seriously not going to fly for public opinion).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It would be so absolutely detrimental to the gun rights groups that it would probably end up shifting opinion.  News stories about settlements being handed out, and teachers going to jail for shooting their students (even though it was negligent), would make people go &amp;quot;Wait you mean the people I trust with my kids suck with guns... I don&amp;#39;t want my neighbor to have a gun, that dude is just an accountant, they are way less responsible then teachers&amp;quot;...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying it wouldn&amp;#39;t save more lives then it would end, I&amp;#39;m saying all you need is a few accidents (which will happen) and suddenly all you will hear about is the armed teachers who shot students on accident, and with the drop in school shootings, the only thing people will remember is the presence of guns in these schools is killing kids, not saving them, even though the exact opposite may be true.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ninja Edit- Also don&amp;#39;t discount the one teacher who might go crazy and kill a few kids on purpose before other teachers can get over to stop him.   Though this is less likely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
I believe racial profiling works. CMV,"I believe that racial profiling has utility in the law-enforcement/national security realm.  I am arguing for it's utility, not it's morality.  I believe that as a nation, we have to be willing to sacrifice our security effectiveness in order to preserve our citizen's rights.  Having said that.  Racial profiling works.  It is not a solution, but it is simply one of the traits law-enforcement should use to prioritize their tasks.  A simple example:  After capturing a known terrorist in the US, the FBI discovered this person has basic phone contact with 100 other people.  The FBI also discovered a plot to blow up something, in the near future. Considering that:   * Statistically our domestic terrorist has much higher likelihood in a specific gender, race, ethnicity, and religion. (edit:  People have pointed out this is a false blanket statement and I agree.  I meant it in reference to leads from CT investigation into Muslim terrorist organization.)  * The FBI has no other additional information they can rely on to prioritize the list.  * This is a time sensitive situation.  Given these premises, there is no reason why the FBI shouldn't profile the list of POIs by gender, race, ethnicity, and religion.  Thus, racial profiling has utilities.  Here is the more provocative argument: If statistically, in a specific area in the US, that white males between the age of 20-30 are murders.  Would it be unreasonable for a police officer patrolling that area to pay more attention to white males between the age of 20-30?   Said police officer is trained to be prepared for all threats.  So for that officer, if he was approached by a 26 year old white male and a 26 year old Asian male at the same time from different direction and he can only choose to observe one, it would be reasonable for him to observe the 26 year old white male because statistically in this local area that is where the threat is likely to be from.  Again, racial profile has utilities.  CMV.  EDIT:  Here are the prevalent arguments so far (and my responses.):  1.  There are other better ways to profile than using race. (Agreed.  I never claim race is the best way, or even a good way to profile people.  I am claiming it has its use at certain circumstances.  That it is not ""always useless"")  2.  If you racially profile one race.  You let the other races go free. (For some reason there is a perception that if you racially profile one race to prioritize your investigation, that it means you will **not** investigate the suspects outside of the profile.  Racial profiling (when used correctly) allow you to prioritize tasks, not eliminate tasks.)  3.  Law-enforcement should be fair, racial profiling will unfairly mark one race as criminals. (I agree with this.  Which is why I don't think racial profiling should be used.  But that doesn't mean it is not effective.  If you can remove 10 murderers of the same race, or 2 murderers per 4 different races, what is more effective?)  4.  Racial profiling creates more criminals by alienating a race. (This would be a very strong argument if someone can cite a study that can show this is true.  I am having a hard time submitting the idea that seeing your race being targeted by a stereotype, your response is to go commit some more crime to reinforce that idea.  As in:  I just saw my cousin got tossed in jail because he committed a crime.  I am a law-abiding citizen and I just got pulled over by the cops and harassed.  They wasted my time and insulted me in front of my family, but found no reason to arrest me.  Now I am going to go commit a crime because I am angry.)  5. Criminal justice data is wrong.  There is a false conviction rate in the criminal justice system.  If all criminal data is wrong, then any profile based on that statistic is also wrong. (This is an interesting argument.  But I dismiss it because this argument basically make **all** criminal justice discussion irrelevant.  As in:  You shouldn't have more police presence at a high crime area because your high crime data area is wrong.  So if your argument is that any data you have is fallible because the way the data is corrected is fallible, than no data can ever be used to support any argument.)  6. People will use this incorrectly and make mistakes. (Mis-using an item doesn't mean it is useless.  Are cars useless because it can kill people?)  Also, see keel_bright's analysis, pretty awesome.   ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of points:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are going to find crime where you look, but not where you don&amp;#39;t look. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean crime isn&amp;#39;t occurring where you are not looking, just that you won&amp;#39;t see it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In American law, we are guaranteed both equal protection and a presumption of innocence. Racial profiling is the opposite of those things. A black man is treated differently (i.e. more likely to be harassed by police) because of his race, which violates equal protection. It also creates a situation where black men are presumed to be less innocent than white men. You are searching someone because of a presumption of guilt, not a presumption of innocence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If point two--the foundation of our rule of law--means anything, then it doesn&amp;#39;t matter whether racial profiling works. It is as illegal as anything you would catch. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Racial profiling creates more criminals by alienating a race. (This would be a very strong argument if someone can cite a study that can show this is true. I am having a hard time submitting the idea that seeing your race being targeted by a stereotype, your response is to go commit some more crime to reinforce that idea. As in: I just saw my cousin got tossed in jail because he committed a crime. I am a law-abiding citizen and I just got pulled over by the cops and harassed. They wasted my time and insulted me in front of my family, but found no reason to arrest me. Now I am going to go commit a crime because I am angry.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not really how personal choices work on a policy setting. We aren&amp;#39;t talking about the choice of a single individual, in the immediate aftermath of a single incident of racial profiling. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;d be more like the results on a large population after a large number of consecutive times of racial profiling. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But anyways... on a more personal level, I have a hard time seeing how the police would serve as a deterrent to crime for an individual who already has the prior expectation of being arrest regardless of guilt. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I also have a hard time imagining a group of people who have strained relations with the police... wanting to cooperate with the police in the first place. It is a known fact that the police cannot be everywhere at once, and so, they need help from the citizenry to keep law and order. That is something you are not going to want to see break down. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: The decline in violent crime in the early-mid '90s is mainly the result of Abortion becoming legal 20 years earlier,"During the '80s early '90s violent crime (especially youth violent crime) was endemic and escalating in America. However, in the mid-'90s violent crime bottomed out. This happened in cities that adopted tough on crime approaches (NYC) cities that adopted liberal community policing policies (Boston) and cities that changed nothing.  According to the Donohue-Levitt hypothesis this is the result legalized abortion. Basically the idea is that pre-roe vs. wade unwanted children would by born, raised in abusive and neglectful situations that generally predisposed them to violence and than bump up the violent crime rate. post roe vs wade these unwanted kids would never be born and thus not cause the statistical rise in crime.  Change my view.  By the way, I dont care about the morality of abortion. If someone believes that abortion is murder, than the Donohue-Levitt hypothesis doesn't prove them wrong even if it is correct _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV: Automation will not be a problem in the future,"EDIT: My view has been changed and deltas awarded, comments are no longer necessary to change my mind  Let my clarify my point; I am not a believer in the notion that one day robots will be doing all the jobs and responsibilities required within the workforce while we, the humans, struggle to find a job. Instead, I simply don’t believe that automation will take off on the widespread scale that some people are speculating. In this Youtube video [Humans Need Not Apply]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) the narrator believes that all jobs, not just simple manufacturing jobs, will be replaced by robots. He relates our perils to that of the early 20th century horse that was replaced by the automobile. But I think this comparison is crude and does not take into the account of economics.   Let’s say his vision comes to fruition and the people with unskilled jobs are given the boot. And for the sake of generalization, let’s also assume that the number of people receiving minimum wage is roughly similar to the number of unskilled laborers in the US (if you don’t agree with this generalization I apologize). According the 2011 study from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, [73.9 million people]( http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2011.htm) work for minimum wage salary which represents almost 3/5 the number of salaried workers in the US. So back to the matter at hand. Let’s say that they are let go from their jobs due to the fact that automation would be cheaper for business owners. We now have roughly 74 million people out of jobs. Yup, I’d say that would put us in the very least a recession, or possibly a depression. These 74 million people would be unable to acquire the skills necessary to be hirable in the dwindling workforce due to a lack of money to receive an education.  So now let’s assume that these 74 million people without jobs will go into a super saving mode in order to be able to buy food and keep whatever shelter they have over their heads. I don’t think the government will be able to provide substantial welfare to almost half of the work force. According to [Labor Market Information]( http://www.dlt.ri.gov/lmi/laus/us/usadj.htm) the workforce in August of 2011 was 153,724 Americans and the workforce in July of 2014 was 156,023 people. Pretty similar numbers, so let’s stick with 2011 since that’s the date of the BLS study. If we add the current unemployed with the newly unemployed due to automation and divide that number by the labor force (73.9+13.8)/153.72 we would get an unemployment rate of 57%. Yikes I doubt the economy is doing great right now with almost 60% of the population unemployed. Even if the robots are cheaper and banging out products day in and day out, who is going to buy the merchandise? The United States GDP would be in crumbles! Businesses would go out of business due to a lack of cash flow and even more people would be unemployed. It would be a nasty cycle that would keep pushing more and more people out of jobs and onto the streets.  Now, I think that the only way this level of automation would work is if our society converted into completely socialist society and shared the wealth and products of the robots equally. But I simply don’t see that happening. It would be possibly the largest undertaking by the Government ever to create a working and efficient socialist system based purely on handouts. Plus I can’t ever see the government allowing automation to take away the jobs of so many Americans. When Tesla began to put pressure on regular auto dealers because of their superior product, New Jersey, Texas, Colorado, Arizona, and Virginia all prohibited the sale of Tesla’s in their states. If those states will go to those measures to protect car dealers, I would bet money that the Federal Government would do a good deal to protect the jobs of 60% of the workforce.  I simply don’t think that automation will change our lives as radically as the folks at /r/futurology would like you to believe. Sure, automation will come into effect in the future, but I don’t think that it will be the problem that some have been making it out to be.

The pedant in me wants to point out that you clearly think it will be &amp;quot;a problem&amp;quot;, you just think it will be one that will be solved by businesses and/or the government.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I think the interesting parts come from the business side of things, because I&amp;#39;m very skeptical that the federal government would even try to ban automation in any sense. I think it just seems futile, as I would suspect both businesses and customers would become increasingly hostile to this idea, as it would directly class with their short term goals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So what about businesses, themselves? Which is what you seem to argue towards in one of your other responses. A case could be made that if you suspect that automation would lead to the economy collapsing, that businesses would somehow stop this from happening. I mean, sure, what business wants to run in a collapsed economy?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t think its this simple. Even though employees are also often customers of the company they work for, businesses rely on &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; customers that get their income from somewhere else. And here&amp;#39;s where it gets hairy. If my business employs 1000 people, but sells widgets to 1 million customers, it&amp;#39;s absolutely in &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; best interest to automate. I can&amp;#39;t control what my competitors do, so I want to lower &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; costs as much as possible and hope that my customers still exist. I could choose to not automate &amp;quot;for the greater good&amp;quot; and keep my employees working, but based on your concerns, that&amp;#39;s primarily going to help my &lt;em&gt;competitors&lt;/em&gt;, who may automate, cut their costs, and then sell to my employees, at least until I go out of business. And so we have the downward spiral that is the subject of concern.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t to say that you&amp;#39;re view is &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; per se, it just seems to me to be woefully incomplete. I&amp;#39;m very skeptical that businesses are going to work together on this sort of thing, and even if they did, would that kind of collusion even be legal? I don&amp;#39;t know! I&amp;#39;m interested in what mechanism exactly you think would be in play for this to actually work. The great depression wasn&amp;#39;t good for businesses, but they didn&amp;#39;t magically come up some way to cooperate and avoid it, nor was the government able to come up with a plan to prevent it. So I&amp;#39;m interested in more details as to who exactly is going to come in and save us here from something that you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; acknowledge has the potential to collapse our economy, and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; exactly they&amp;#39;re going to do that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Personally, I think that if costs were driven down sufficiently by automation, a socialist system would make a lot of sense, and wouldn&amp;#39;t be nearly as hard to achieve as you suspect. Basing the &amp;quot;economy&amp;quot; (term used VERY loosely) on so-called government handouts may seem like a huge undertaking now, but if automation makes literally everything on the planet dirt cheap, the government doesn&amp;#39;t actually need to do much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could you clarify which view we&amp;#39;re supposed to change? Preferably choose one, it&amp;#39;s going to be hard to change your view on life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Automation will not be a problem in the future.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Automation will not be doing all of the jobs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Automation will not take-off on the widescale.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The government cares about the entirety of the population it governs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Automation will cause economic problems. &amp;lt;- this confuses me, as it pretty much contradicts your no.1 view in the title.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The government has control of private businesses hiring policies.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Automation will not change our lives as radically as the folks at &lt;a href=""/r/futorology""&gt;/r/futorology&lt;/a&gt; believe.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m honestly confused as to what you&amp;#39;re trying to advocate in your post and what exactly are we supposed to argue against.

"CMV: Walmart is an evil corporation, which is bad for the USA and the world","Many believe Walmart is a corrupt, or cruel/evil company. Crime runs rampant in their parking lots with little care from them.

Overall, the they a net negative for the world - their deals are deceiving as they use loss leaders to lure in shoppers who then purchase items that are actually more expensive than competitors, etc.   So, is Walmart actually not so bad?

If it is, either by driving away customers or creating a public relations disaster, then it will.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are good people who work for these companies, but they rarely can stop the company from legally making money because it doesn&amp;#39;t seem right.

CMV: Rich people should not be judged solely because of their wealth. This is ignorant and hateful. Please change my view.,"A rich person could be rich because he stole it. A rich person could be rich because he cheated for it. A rich person could be rich because he inherited it. A rich person could be rich because he won the lottery. A rich person could be rich because he was a good poker player. A rich person could be rich because he worked very hard for it. A rich person could be rich because he succeeded in business. Being rich has little to no connections as to what type of person he is.  A poor person could be poor because he was scammed out of his money. A poor person could be poor because his parents were poor. A poor person could be poor because he gambled his wealth away. A poor person could be poor because he was a druggy and an alcoholic.  A poor person could be poor because he was extremely unfortunate. The likelihood of a poor person being an asshole is equal to that of a rich person being a prick.   One should NEVER judge a person solely based on what they have and what they don't have.   If you are young and drive a nice sports car, I should NOT automatically think that you are a prick.  If you are young and is struggling to pay off your student loans, I should NOT automatically think that you are a nice person.  Because I am young and I am fortunate enough to drive a nice car, people DO sometimes see me as an undeserving asshole. Though those who know me and know of my aspirations of wanting to help those truly unfortunate out there, see me as a genuine person. I am frustrated and confused as to why this occurs and sometimes I am lead to believe that if I sold my car and purchased a cheap one, the prejudice that I receive will stop.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

i believe that women who would end a relationship if their partner asked for a paternity test are cheaters or potential cheaters. CMV.,"I was reading through an old thread http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/19rz0w/ladies_if_your_so_asked_for_a_paternity_test_what/  and a majority of the women posters stated they would end their relationships marriages if asked to get a paternity test by their SO.  Paternity fraud happens. It's real. It destroys the people it happens to, emotionally and legally with the 'fathers' having to pay support for children who aren't theirs.  And while not all people are cheaters and deceivers, a lot of them are and are very good at it to the point the 'fathers' don't know they've been duped until long after the fact and it is very difficult to tell the difference between an honest partner and a partner that's very good at lying, cheating and manipulating, especially when under the influence of love.  The women that supposedly ""never have cheated and never would"" have a marked lack of empathy for men who just want to make sure to 99.99% that their kid is actually theirs like women know 100% that their kid is theirs.  I would think that the women that say that trust is foremost in a relationship would understand that there are other extremely shady women out there that would deceive a man about his paternity to a child and that those women try to make themselves appear trustworthy too, but apparently thats not a consideration for those 'honest' women.  So i believe that women who would end a relationship if their partner asked for a paternity test are the latter posing as the former. Change My View.  edit: man, the questions are coming faster than I can type! I will get to them as i can! Thank you for responding everyone!  edit 2; this has blown up! im taking a short break from responding but will be back in a little while.  edit 3; I concede its a generalization to say that *all* women that would end a relationship if their partner asked for a paternity test are (potential) cheaters but i think that is the most likely reason they would do so.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can sort of understand how if a woman freaks out because the supposed &amp;quot;father&amp;quot; of her child is asking for a paternity test, that that could make her seem guilty. It just looks like she&amp;#39;s protesting too much. However, I do think there would be many situations where the woman is in NO way a cheater, never been a cheater, never even THOUGHT about cheating.. and just takes offense that her partner would even consider the fact that she might have cheated. For me, it would show a lack of trust in my character. For me, I wouldn&amp;#39;t protest though. For me, I would do the paternity test in a HEARTBEAT, if the father of my child asked. But I would also break up with him the moment he asked for it. No bad blood either way - at least for me - I understand that he needs to be sure. But if he isn&amp;#39;t sure just because I tell him he&amp;#39;s the only possible father, then we shouldn&amp;#39;t be in a long term relationship raising a kid together. That&amp;#39;s the the facts of the situation and the way I see it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asking for a paternity test is declaring that you don&amp;#39;t have total trust that your partner is being faithful. It&amp;#39;s understandable that some would see it as an accusation. If a relationship was already under stress I think that asking for a paternity test could potentially make a woman want to end the relationship. Does this make them a cheater or potential cheater? No.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"I believe that buying books isn't worth it, and piracy is how I read the vast majority of novels CMV","I'm 22 and I've moved three times in the last two years. I'm finally settled down into a solid place, but my lease is up in a year, who knows what happens after that. Every time I've moved, I've thrown more and more books out. They're heavy, burdensome, and not worth the packing space. I've saved a few important novels that have had an impact on my development, but everything else has gone to charity. The more I think about it, the more I realize that the only time I've read in the last few years has been on a Kindle full of pirated material. Books are so expensive for the hours of entertainment I get out of them, and they're free at libraries anyways, so why spend the money on something I'm going to toss the next time I move? I'm a writer myself, but I don't think I'd be buying books if I weren't pirating them, so at least I'm reading this way. Change my view - convince me that buying books is helping authors in a substantial way.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Books are so expensive for the hours of entertainment I get out of them&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What?  These days the average cost of a movie, let alone a 3D one, would cover the cost of a book.  You get maybe 3 hrs max of entertainment from a movie.  You get hours, days, possibly weeks of entertainment from a book (depending on how fast you read and how much time you have). How is that in any way expensive?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a writer myself&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So if you published something, you wouldn&amp;#39;t want to earn any money from it?

How many hours are you spending to finish them? I think you&amp;#39;d be hard pressed to find an activity that will give you as much entertainment hours per dollar spent than a book, unless of course you&amp;#39;re buying first print classics for thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;they&amp;#39;re free at libraries anyways&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Why not take advantage of the free library books then instead of piracy?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;why spend the money on something I&amp;#39;m going to toss the next time I move?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You definitely shouldn&amp;#39;t, unless you&amp;#39;re getting something more out of the books than just 30 hours worth of diversion. That&amp;#39;s a choice though you&amp;#39;ll have to make at the end of the book. &amp;quot;Was this good enough to justify me putting it in a box and moving it with me when my lease is up?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;convince me that buying books is helping authors in a substantial way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You need to know something about how books get published. It&amp;#39;s a troublesome process for the author. They write a manuscript and if they&amp;#39;re smart, they pay an editor to help them refine the book. This costs a non-trivial amount of money that the author pays out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next the author must present the edited manuscript to a publisher. This process is facilitated sometimes by an agent who will help negotiate the royalty figures that the author will receive. If the publisher thinks the book will do well, then they&amp;#39;ll agree to produce a batch of books. I&amp;#39;m not sure where the minimum is, but they don&amp;#39;t just print a million copies and hope it sells. They print probably like 10-15k first run hardbacks in your average case and they watch how well they sell. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;this is the point in the process where your piracy really has the potential to fuck over the author&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If there is not enough collective interest in a book because 10k people decide they can&amp;#39;t be bothered to pack up a book when it&amp;#39;s time to move, so they pirate, then the publisher will see only 5k of this author&amp;#39;s books selling. They&amp;#39;ll decide not to do a second run and the author will have maybe a little income from a book that, had piracy not happened, might have actually done well. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You see, in publishing, there&amp;#39;s sort of a critical mass that a novel needs to hit before it can start snowballing off its own momentum. If this mass is not reached early in the novel&amp;#39;s initial publication run, then the novel just sort of sputters out unless there&amp;#39;s some sort of cult following that grows and demands more prints. As you can guess, this is kind of rare.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Granted this scenario applies mainly to fledgling novels from authors who have not had NYT Best sellers, pirating a NYT Best seller really won&amp;#39;t have much impact aside from a few less dollars in an author&amp;#39;s bank account.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re ok with denying an author money for their efforts and labor, I don&amp;#39;t really think I can convince you otherwise. Piracy is a pretty hard-to-argue concept because of the whole &amp;quot;if I didn&amp;#39;t pirate, I wouldn&amp;#39;t read it anyway&amp;quot; argument.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Still, I think any decent person who reads a book and enjoys it should kick some money towards the author for their efforts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Smoking cigarettes is inconsiderate (almost) always and everywhere,"It has been known for decades that smoking causes cancer, even for the *passive* smokers (that is, people who breathe in the smoke created by *someone else* smoking a cigarette).

Also your toxins will leave the room as soon as a door or window is opened. * If you smoke on your balcony, you force your toxins on anyone who might be standing on *their* balcony, or whose window might let in the smoke. * In summary, anywhere you smoke, you’re being inconsiderate to other people.

If you are unwilling to even try, or you claim that you’ve tried and given up, or you bring up any other lame excuse to continue doing it, then you are being inconsiderate. * “There are lots of other toxins, and some of them are in higher concentration than cigarette smoke.” — This is changing the subject.

I'll buy the justification that it's traditional, not religious. But I'm open to anything. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a simple as this: America is not a Christian nation. Having a reference to the God of a specific religion on a federally issued document is an affront to the idea of religious freedom and secularism.

CMV: I am uncomfortable inviting the partners of gay/lesbian people to my wedding.,"Morning CMVers. I've got a bit of a dilemma that I'm interested in discussing with you all. I hope this is the right place, and I think I need an opposing viewpoint on all this.  My SO and I are to be soon getting married. We've been looking through the guest list and noticed that some family members and friends are homosexual (a couple of lesbians and a gay).   We are both atheists, and hold no religious views whatsoever, however, I have always firmly held the belief that marriage is something that celebrates heterosexual partnership, and I would be extremely uncomfortable seeing men/women dancing/kissing people of the same sex at the wedding.   There is also the problem that one of these people is single, and like to try and seduce other women. I'm not sure how to deal with her as this would cause great disapproval from both sides of the family, and potentially alienate us from family members.  I'm also worried that family members would think our wedding was a 'shambles' for having them invited in the first place.  My SO and I have already made the decision that we aren't going to be inviting any homosexual partners, as we don't want them to be a part of the wedding. But I'm still very unsure about the remaining homosexuals...  Anyone care to weigh in?  Edit: Some people seem to think that I'm a terrible homosexual hating 'bigot' - I'd like to point out that whilst yes some certain groups of homosexuals actions do wierd me out, I personally do accept that homosexual relationships are just as valid as hetrosexual relationsips. I'm happy that my friends are happy with each other.  My main concerns are:  1 - That I'm worried, because these individuals are heavily into gay culture that they will act 'very gay' and almost make the whole wedding about them being gays at a straight wedding look at us.   and   2 - That because of the above, my family members won't remember my and my fiancée's special day as a wonderful memory to be cherished, but a shambles that's best left forgotten, shame on I_Like_Food_Lots for letting his wedding go on this way... I appreciate that these people *are* bigoted, but they are my closest family all the same and I want to make them feel special with us.   **EDIT 2**  I have to go now but thanks to everyone who contributed, even those who were somewhat negative, everyone is entitled to their opinion!  I've enjoyed this and can honestly say my view has been changed. I've given the delta to those who I think helped but please let me know if I mistakenly missed you. I won't be able to respond any more but please feel free to continue to post, I may be able to come back and talk some more later, however again I'd say that for now I think my problems are on the way to being resolved and I now see how wrong I was in my old view.   I'm going to talk to the partygoers who I think may cause a scene and just ask them to tone it down for the day - just the same as I would with any straight person who would act the same way. I'll point out that I'm not singling them out *because they are gay* but because of the way they act as a person.  I'm also going to talk with my family members and let them know that this is our decision and that I want them to support us on out big day, hopefully I'm just overreacting and there won't be an issue. But if there is I think a lot of you are right in saying that excluding people says far worse about me than anything else ever could.

It sounds to me like you are just very uncomfortable with the fact that you have family / friends that are gay, and you don&amp;#39;t like to acknowledge that fact. Because any of these statements could be made about heterosexual people as well, and yet you have narrowed your focus only to this narrow group of guests. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for what friends and family think - you will probably have friends and family who think much less of you as a person if you choose to not invite someone because of their sexuality as well, so you are going to have to pick a side with that one. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
I've suffered from cancer and don't think it's morally right for me to reproduce because of it. CMV.,"So long story short, I suffered from bone cancer of the cranium in childhood. I am very doubtful it will ever return, but the surgeries I had to go through to rid myself of it was agonizing to say the least. I also missed out on a pretty big part of my childhood and did not develop the social skills that other kids did due to so much time spent out of school.  I know that my cancer was genetically passed onto me and I know that it still remains in my genes. I would not wish what I went through on my worst enemy, let alone my own child and I think that having a child knowing that would only make me a selfish human being because I would be placing my need to be happy above the well-being of the child I would create.  For this reason, I don't think anyone else with genetic disorders such as cancer or mental illness should be encouraged to reproduce either. ***I'm not saying that there should be laws against it or forced sterilization***, but I do think people should know that they are going to be passing on their suffering to the person they claim to love the most, who will then to the same to another child when they grow up.  If it were up to nature and there were no doctors, medicine, or anything like that, people like me would have likely died before we ever got the chance to bear children. This is a harsh truth, but is something evolution does to ultimately wipe stuff like this from the gene pool and it is better for the species as a result. I believe the only way to truly cure cancer and other genetic disorders would be to wipe it clean from our genes. If people voluntarily chose to not reproduce like I am doing, there would be far less people with genetic disorders.  EDIT:I'm very pleased with the outcome of this discussion. I knew from the start that this thought would be controversial and I knew that not everyone would agree, but i'm glad that the responses were civil and intelligent. This an an issue that I am not dead-set on, which is why I thought it would be perfect for this sub-reddit and I sometimes go to the other side and think of the exact same things that were presented here. For the people who did articulate those thoughts better than I ever could, I will award them a delta because it has planted a seed in my mind that could grow to change my view in the future.   Thank you again for the excellent responses and the upvotes given to this thread.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother has Carcinoid Cancer, which is a slow growing and potentially fatal cancer (examples include Dave Thomas of Wendy&amp;#39;s and Steve Jobs). The cancer is made up gastroentero pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that secrete hormones causing negative reactions like flushing, arthritis, and IBS. Due to the slow growth rate of the tumors chemotherapy is not an option and surgery is rarely successful as a cure. Is there a significant chance that I could get this disease? Yes. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Do I hold any resentment towards my mother for giving birth to me, knowing that she could pass this disease down to me? Absolutely not. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All life is a gift. And while you went through an agonizing and harrowing experience as a child, you lived. And you stated in another comment that you consider yourself very grateful for your life because of what you went through. Because I view life as a gift, I do not consider having children a selfish act, therefore I do not view you taking a chance of passing down your cancer by having children immoral. And I certainly hope my mother doesn&amp;#39;t view me as a potential to dirty the genetic pool of society with cancer. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I believe &lt;a href=""/u/fnredditacct""&gt;/u/fnredditacct&lt;/a&gt; explained it in a much better way, I also wanted you to consider it from the point of view of a child of a cancer patient. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s a question of probabilities.  For instance, there are genetic conditions which are carried through the Y-chromosome, so you have a 50% chance of your child getting it.  Obviously, the severity of the condition enters into it as well, but that&amp;#39;s a pretty grim stat (unless you&amp;#39;re willing to consider gender-based abortion in that case).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, maybe your genes double your child&amp;#39;s chance of getting bone cancer - but it takes it from 1 in 10 million to one in one-million.  You&amp;#39;ve increased the risk 10 times, but it&amp;#39;s still quite unlikely.  Maybe it even takes it to one in 10,000 - those are still excellent odds.  (Obviously I don&amp;#39;t know the stats about your condition, so this is all speculation).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, other genes increase the chance of heart attacks, or strokes, or skin cancer.  Even though I have been fortunate enough to never have had cancer, you might have a statistically better genetic profile than I do.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unless you know that your child would have a demonstrably and significant risk of getting bone cancer, your history shouldn&amp;#39;t keep you from reproducing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: There can not be an omniscient all-knowing God if humans have free will. The two can't coexist.,"I've argued this to friends before and stand by it. If I have the decision and free will to do A, B, C or X, Y, Z in my life or in my day, then God can not be omniscient and know what is going to happen because ultimately the decision is up to me. Now the rebuttal I always hear is that ""you have this free will but even though you have so many choices God will still know what you are going to do,"" which I think is a weak argument because then I say well then there is no free will and the two can not coexist. Assuming there is a God, human free will and God's omniscience can't coexist.

Since He is outside of time and eternal, to him, everything is but a memory.

I do not love my parents. CMV,"I have caring parents. They supported me for a long time. But when I look at them objectively, they are average human beings. I am 25, and at this stage in my life, they add little value to my life. Why should I keep up with them just because they invested in me? The past is a sunk cost.  This extends beyond just parents.

Even if you have really good friends it would surprise me. Probably they will leave quiet, some sooner, the best ones later. But they will leave, because they have their own lifes that can exist without you. A SO? Maybe, maybe not. When you are very lucky then maybe they do. But often this kind of bond is not strong enough. Your parents will stay. They put up with all your shit in your childhood (You said they did care for you, so I&amp;#39;ll assume it was a healthy relationship between you and them). You are what will stay from them when they die. You are simply the most important thing for them. So, you will always can rely on them.

I think most atheists are better people than most religious people. CMV,"I know a lot of nice guys, both atheists and christians.

Many Christians may &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; that their morality comes from God, but if one examines their &lt;em&gt;behavior&lt;/em&gt; I expect you&amp;#39;ll find it to be comparable to the behavior of an average atheist.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would want to see some evidence that atheists act in more moral ways than Christians before I would support your generalization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, you&amp;#39;re thinking about this in a stereotypically Christian way instead of a stereotypically atheist way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You believe that most religious people act a certain way because that matches up with how you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; the world to be.

"I believe that if you are born a white male, you have it easier than the rest of us. CMV.","This is a little bit of a response to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jzymk/i_believe_that_attractive_white_women_lead_easier/) thread. I believed it was wrong and pushed out my own view instead. I believe this to be true for several reasons that I will divide into two topics. (Note: I am a non-white female, as one would guess.)  1. Why a man. 2. Why being white.  ~~I believe it is easier to be a man because:  * **Nobody is afraid of women.** If I go out late at night, there has to be a trusted man with me. There are rapists at night, or if I get into an accident, who's going to change my tire? If I want to go travel extensively in a foreign country, especially the considered ""third world"" country, it's too dangerous. I am a woman, and I am American, and everyone knows how to to take advantage of that.   * **If I sleep around, I am a slut. If a man sleeps around, he is a stud.** No one gets very angry if a man abandons the baby he fathered. Yet, if I a woman knows that she won't be able to handle this baby, or if it was born out of rape, there are plenty of states where I wouldn't be able to abort it. If I even have sex with one person before they commit their entire being to me (aka: marriage), it's a risk. What if a mistake happens and I get pregnant?  * **Men have freedom of opportunity.** There are still many lucrative professions that are anti-women. Tech and Engineering are the most popular ones. I don't want to go in them, but I'm not sure if it's because of the societal view placed upon me, that I can not, or if it really is an independent choice. Some people may say that if I really wanted to, I could still be go into tech or engineering, but there are extra difficulties involved that make one ask -- is it worth it?  * **Men aren't objectified.** If I go anywhere looking fashionable and attractive, I will get harassed. If a man goes out with fashion and taste, he won't. (Chances are, that he won't, at least.) Even women see fashionable, tasteful women as bad for society; harlots.  * (This one is a bit humorous, but still.) **Men don't have periods.** ~~  **I now believe that men and women face different problems and that's okay. If you would still like to comment about this, feel free to, but know that my mind is changed.**   I'm sure that there are other things, but I thought these covered some broad areas regarding societal views. Now here's why I think being white is easier in my country, America.  * **In Fortune 500 companies, only 18 CEOs are of another race.** [(source)](http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-facts/wheres-the-diversity-in-fortune-500-ceos/)  * **There is still heavy racism against anyone who isn't white.** I know a lot of people say that there is racism if you're white, but how much of it is joking? My parents are immigrants, and although they speak English quite well, they still have an awkward wording and an unnatural tone of speech. When we go out, there are people who downright disrespect my mom because she is not white and she doesn't speak like she's white. There was racism in her workplace, at stores, at restaurants from the waiters/waitresses, and at job interviews.   * **[There are too many Asians at top colleges.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/education/edlife/07asian.html?em&amp;ex=1168318800&amp;en=c1659d374db49dfa&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;_r=0)** We still don't know if there is a real bias against Asians at top colleges, and if it will change prospects. I know that there was a problem, too many whites at colleges, but that was due to blatant racism against minorities. There were minorities who outperformed the white student, and the colleges rejected them because they were a minority. Now, we see too many minorities outranking white students, and they must be stopped!  * **Religious tolerance is insanely low.** I don't know if this really counts as a racial issue, but I think it counts. If you're even remotely Middle Eastern, you will get picked on for being Muslim, regardless of whether or not you are Muslim. Even if you're Indian, which is far away from Iraq/Iran/Afghanistan, you will get picked on for being the evil Muslims who have invaded ""our country."" [Here's a really recent example. Sikhs are NOT Muslim.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikh_shooting) Even if they were Muslim, that doesn't account for the racism that is experienced on a daily basis.  This concludes my reasons. I've believed this for a very long time. When I was 10, I rejected everything and named myself a white male. At that time, I didn't even know about half of these reasons, at least consciously. But I hope this was coherent and supported enough that you will CMV.   Thanks for your time.  edit: Strikethroughs don't seem to be working, but I want to retain the original comments.

It&amp;#39;s not easy for anyone, and each race, sex, sexual orientation, etc, has it&amp;#39;s own challenges and difficulties in life. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nobody is afraid of women. If I go out late at night, there has to be a trusted man with me. There are rapists at night, or if I get into an accident, who&amp;#39;s going to change my tire? If I want to go travel extensively in a foreign country, especially the considered &amp;quot;third world&amp;quot; country, it&amp;#39;s too dangerous. I am a woman, and I am American, and everyone knows how to to take advantage of that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a man in my thirties, if I were to interact with a woman I didn&amp;#39;t know either at a bar, or the supermarket, or at work there&amp;#39;s immediately the assumption that I am simply trying to &amp;quot;get with them&amp;quot;. A guy cannot simply be nice to a woman without there being some preconceived notion that it&amp;#39;s an attempt at wooing the particular individual. Likewise, if I attempt to help someone out of the goodness of my heart say if they have a broken down on the side of the road or they are visibly lost in a city at night, there&amp;#39;s the assumption that I am simply going to try and harm them. People are scared of men. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter for race or age, if you&amp;#39;re a guy and you&amp;#39;re interacting with a woman who you don&amp;#39;t know, there&amp;#39;s a danger sense women put forth which is entirely unfair, it makes sense, but it&amp;#39;s still unfair. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I sleep around, I am a slut. If a man sleeps around, he is a stud. No one gets very angry if a man abandons the baby he fathered. Yet, if I a woman knows that she won&amp;#39;t be able to handle this baby, or if it was born out of rape, there are plenty of states where I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to abort it. If I even have sex with one person before they commit their entire being to me (aka: marriage), it&amp;#39;s a risk. What if a mistake happens and I get pregnant?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is one issue in regards to sex and men, and that issue is that men have to be the sex fiends that most see us as being. We need to want sex all of the time. We need to want to have sex with as many woman (or guys if you&amp;#39;re gay) as possible. This fact is punched into our skulls time, and time, and time again within the media, music, advertising, etc, etc. If a guy states he wants to wait to have sex, he&amp;#39;s immediately seen as less than a man by pretty much everyone. If he wants to wait to have sex until after marriage it goes so far as to others believing he&amp;#39;s secretly gay. Men have the same issues and insecurities about sex as women, but unlike woman we&amp;#39;re not allowed to voice them. If we voice our insecurities, we&amp;#39;re seen as a lesser individual or even worse, a worse dating/relationship prospect.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then it also comes down to the issue regarding pregnancy. A lot of the blame is put on guys when it comes down to sex and getting woman pregnant. As the old saying goes, it takes two to tango. There are plenty of men out there who are told and reassured by woman that she is &amp;quot;on the pill&amp;quot;, but either the woman takes the pill incorrectly or lies about it in general. In the realms of the court, men are still to blame when the woman gets pregnant. Yes, there&amp;#39;s condoms, but people forget in the heat of the moment. Men can push all they want to make the right decision for that couple and unborn child (adoption, abortion, etc), but in the end the courts always fall in favor of the woman. This is including parental custody, and it is harder for a man to get custody than a woman. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Men have freedom of opportunity. There are still many lucrative professions that are anti-women. Tech and Engineering are the most popular ones. I don&amp;#39;t want to go in them, but I&amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;#39;s because of the societal view placed upon me, that I can not, or if it really is an independent choice. Some people may say that if I really wanted to, I could still be go into tech or engineering, but there are extra difficulties involved that make one ask -- is it worth it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t always true. Yes, maybe this is the case in the tech and engineering fields, but it&amp;#39;s untrue elsewhere. I am a teacher, specifically a teacher for children with developmental disorders. There is a realm of my profession called &amp;quot;intake&amp;quot;. What intake is, is when a child who&amp;#39;s new to the program comes in, they determine the new educational and behavioral goals. In my particular school, because I&amp;#39;m a man I cannot work in this particular field. It&amp;#39;s because if there&amp;#39;s a female child who comes in, I cannot work with that new child. The reason? The preconceived notion that I could sexually assault her. That&amp;#39;s fucked up, isn&amp;#39;t it? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But, let&amp;#39;s look at other realms where it&amp;#39;s harder for men to work. Nursing is one of the biggest. Men are a very large minority in the nursing population. Our culture sees men as being the doctors and physicians, but if one goes into nursing they are seen as strange and not as good as a female nurse. Elementary teaching is another. In our culture men are supposed to do the hard labor, we&amp;#39;re supposed to be doing the &amp;quot;hard tasks&amp;quot;. If a man likes kids and wants to teach young children, the cultural stereotype is that he&amp;#39;s immediately a pedophile. But, let&amp;#39;s not also go into the fact there are men who are stay at home dads. That is an even bigger cultural no-no. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Men aren&amp;#39;t objectified. If I go anywhere looking fashionable and attractive, I will get harassed. If a man goes out with fashion and taste, he won&amp;#39;t. (Chances are, that he won&amp;#39;t, at least.) Even women see fashionable, tasteful women as bad for society; harlots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Men are objectified, and woman are worse at objectifying men than men are with woman. In the dating sphere, a man will date any woman he finds remotely attractive or who possesses those positive qualities a woman has. Woman, nope, woman for the most part have much higher standards. I wish I had a link to it, but the website OKCupid had a research article in regards to the topic. In their research, they found woman rate men worse than men rate woman, this means that woman place more emphasis on who they date based upon looks. Think about it. A guy has to have a certain height, weight, activity level, job description, etc, etc. Often, a man could attempt to woe a woman, and he could have all of the qualities as a woman looks for except one, and immediately he&amp;#39;s put into a different category and he&amp;#39;s no longer a dating prospect. But, though this isn&amp;#39;t true for every woman or man, it&amp;#39;s incredibly common. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But, then there&amp;#39;s the media. Men are shown time and are led to believe time and time again to be muscle bound super macho types, and we&amp;#39;re constantly led to believe that we&amp;#39;re supposed to be those guys or we&amp;#39;re lesser human beings. Our culture wants us to have six pack abs and be taller than six feet. We need to want to play sports, lift, and work out all of the time. If you look at any child&amp;#39;s action figure, they are worse than Barbi in regards to physical proportion. Men are often always displayed having huge muscles and are incredibly fit. If you try finding an average looking action figure, good luck. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;(This one is a bit humorous, but still.) Men don&amp;#39;t have periods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yeah, but men get erectile dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) Nobody is afraid of women&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the flipside, men have to live in constant fear of being maced or tazed at night if they approach a fearful woman. If a man is lost at night and he needs to ask for directions, good luck approaching the woman walking home from public transportation. This suspiciousness towards all men at night is somewhat irrational. If you are afraid of being raped, you should be more fearful of being taken advantage of by an acquaintance than a random stranger. The stats show that you are far more likely to get raped by someone you know than a random stranger. We think stranger rape is far more common than it actually is because of the &amp;quot;availability heuristic&amp;quot; noted by Daniel Kahneman - specifically that the news reports on stranger rape far more often because it is a &amp;quot;scarier&amp;quot; and thus more newsworthy story. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the fact is, men are just as likely to get mugged at night. And muggings on the streets are more common than rapes on the streets. And at my undergrad campus, the university offered a service that would walk women home at night. The service theoretically may have been available to everyone, but it was far too socially unacceptable for a man to use it. Because of the attitude that men could just walk home alone safely. Even though the greatest risk in that neighborhood was getting robbed, not getting raped.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And your argument about &amp;quot;who will change your tire&amp;quot; is backwards. An attractive female stranded at the side of the road is &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more likely to get her tired changed by a helpful stranger than a man faced in the same situation. Sure, there is the &amp;quot;stranger danger&amp;quot; wariness, but you can only have that wariness because it is theoretically possible that a stranger would stop to help you. If a man&amp;#39;s tire goes flat, it&amp;#39;s expected that he knows how to change it himself. And no enterprising young men driving by are trying to get in his pants, so help is less likely to be forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(2) The Slut/Player Dichotomy&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reason a man is given congratulation for sleeping around is because it is difficult to do so. Women don&amp;#39;t just sleep with every guy they meet. They only sleep with highly desirable men. So if a man sleeps around with a lot of women, he must be a very desirable mate. A women who sleeps around doesn&amp;#39;t get to be a &amp;quot;player&amp;quot; because it is easy for women to have sex - they can go to any bar and find a willing partner within five minutes. The &amp;quot;slut&amp;quot; label may be unfair, but it is based on the jealousy of the sexual power that women have because they are the choosers. Saying you would rather be a man, sexually, is like saying that when you are interviewing for a job that you really really want, you would rather be the interviewee than the interviewer, who already has a job at the company and gets to choose the next co-worker. Being the chooser is much better than being the convincer - &amp;quot;choose me, choose me.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure, abortions aren&amp;#39;t available everywhere. But if you practice safe sex, there is almost no chance of getting pregnant (and if a condom breaks, there is the morning after pill). If you had to, you could travel to another state to get an abortion. Regardless, abortion is a two-way street, since a would-be father whose baby mama wants to get an abortion has no say in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(3) Tech and Engineering&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the same token, there are &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many special scholarships for you if you went into these fields, as a non-white female. As a white male, I will never qualify for 90% of the scholarships out there. When I was a 1st year in law school, there were law firms that were &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; hiring minorities for what they call &amp;quot;diversity fellowships.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Assuming you are born into a wealthy family, it is far better to be born a minority, at least in some professions. Because there are so many incentive programs to boost minority involvement in those professions. And if you are born wealthy, many of those &amp;quot;barriers&amp;quot; to entering those professions will be erased for you. Affirmative action at schools like Harvard and Yale tends to benefit only wealth minorities. If you were born into privilege, affirmative action amounts to - as Justice Thomas puts it - aesthetic color balancing. You benefit as a wealthy minority because employers and schools want to have the right racial mix, but they still need people will stellar grades, extra-curriculars, and summer experiences that only wealth enables.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(4) Men don&amp;#39;t get harassed. True. That&amp;#39;s because women aren&amp;#39;t dying to have sex with us constantly. Saying that it sucks to be a woman because men constantly holler at you is like saying that you wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be an A-list movie star or athlete because the public constantly beg you for autographs. Every good thing has its downsides.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Race&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(1) Not many non-white CEO&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not that many minorities go to business school. &lt;a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304830704577496901585090874.html""&gt;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304830704577496901585090874.html&lt;/a&gt; This is likely due to socio-economics more than racism, since business schools would be happy to boost minority enrollment if they could. If a major company was choosing between two &lt;em&gt;equally&lt;/em&gt; qualified CEO candidates, and one was white and other was minority, the minority would win every time. Because it helps the company&amp;#39;s public image.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The above makes it hard for white people in government. For positions of prominence, the president and Congress want to appoint minority candidates. For example, a white male who is liberal is never going to get appointed to the Supreme Court. Those positions are going to go to women or minority judges. Appointing a white male, these days, to a privileged positions of prominence is seen as akin to being a racist. Because you, as the appointer, have the opportunity to fix centuries of racism. So where does that leave white males who aspire to un-elected positions of prominence in government?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(2) Racism against non-whites.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is still racism against black people. But there is not considerable amounts of racism towards Hispanics, Asians, Indian people, or Native Americans (at least on the West Coast, where I&amp;#39;m from). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What you, OP, are describing in xenophobia - dislike of foreigners. And it&amp;#39;s not irrational to want someone who speaks perfect English as an employee. It makes it easier to communicate, and customers prefer it. Regardless, this doesn&amp;#39;t really support your premise. Anyone born in the US, regardless of race, will have an American accent if raised as a native English speaker and exposed to English speaking peers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(3) Too many Asians at top colleges.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Studies of Affirmative Action show that it harms Asians &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;, whites a little, and massively benefits Hispanics and blacks. Studies have found that checking the box on your application that says you are black or Hispanic is equivalent to getting a 400 point boost on your SAT scores. So being white is not the best category in this regard. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I personally think that being born as the wealthy son to a Native American casino baron would be the best position. But being a wealthy male Hispanic is a close second. At least as far as colleges are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(3) Religious tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think anyone would argue that it&amp;#39;s easier to live as a Middle Eastern practicing Muslim in the US currently than as a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP). But there are a lot of other races to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, wealthy attractive Hispanic females are likely live much better lives than your average white male. Race and gender aren&amp;#39;t everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"When I hear a friend has an opinion/belief that I don't agree with, I feel it would be a disservice to both of us to not argue about it. CMV","If someone has an opinion that I think is either obviously wrong or not well supported, I tend to pursue that topic with them to an annoying degree. My goal of pursuing it is to understand why they believe it. If they have good evidence for their opinion/belief, I want to believe it too.   My method of pursuing this conversation is not delicate. If the person I'm talking with doesn't have reasoning I understand, I point out that I don't understand it, what part I don't understand and ask them to clarify. This turns into an argument, and I get angry (frustrated, flustered)  when people use circular logic or don't feel the need to justify their opinions (and beliefs) with evidence or reasoning.  *Edit: I think it is a disservice to both of us if we don't talk about it because if they are right then I am wrong, and if I am right than he is wrong. Or if we misunderstood each other, we could both be wrong or both be right but by talking about it, we would be learning (about the topic, about the other person's views, ect.)   I want to CMV on this because it drives people away, makes me seem insensitive, and hurts friendships.  ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think it is a disservice to both of us if we don&amp;#39;t talk about it because if they are right then I am wrong, and if I am right than he is wrong.

It is much more likely that both people look at the same set of data, but have different ideas about what that data means. You need to understand that often you&amp;#39;re not fighting about facts, but about your perspective on facts, which means that it is not a logical or rational argument, but an &lt;em&gt;emotive&lt;/em&gt; argument.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And if two people simply feel different ways about something, then that is just going to be a barrier. Sure, I can ask you to try the olives, but if you really don&amp;#39;t like the taste no amount of arguing about the consistency, texture or flavor is going to convince you otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At this point, what you have is two people facing off against each other when in reality I should just be able to accept that you dislike olives, or think there may be a god, or lean libertarian and still be good friends with you despite those things because I enjoy your company.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes two people have just exhausted the depth of their knowledge in a debate, and all that is left is both sides&amp;#39; preferences. At that point, you just have to accept that it takes all types of people to make the world go round, and you don&amp;#39;t have to think like someone else to be friends with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not required to justify everything I say/think to a friend.  When I am in a formal setting I conduct myself to avoid spreading conflict, because I&amp;#39;m interacting with people who I can&amp;#39;t expect to accept me for who I am. When I am with my friends, I expect that onus to be removed and basically to be given &amp;quot;consideration&amp;quot; instead of neutral treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you force me to behave neutrally by becoming combative if I am anything but neutral, we will not become good friends.  You may think we are good friends because &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; know &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;, but in my mind we will not be because you will not know me and have demonstrated that you will not accept the real me.  You do not want me, you want a copy of yourself.  We are thus forever acquaintances on my side.  You cannot only accept friendship from carbon-copies of yourself.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"CMV: When one accepts that eating meat is immoral, one would also have to accept that wild animals that naturally eat meat either need to be ""rehabilitated"", or put down.","This is almost a tongue-in-cheek CMV, but the argument still feels like it has a little bit of truth to me. Help me sort this out, would ya?  ""Animals do not know any better, so they cannot be blamed for their actions (i.e. hunting and eating other animals)""  I would think one of the premises for the existence of rehabilitation efforts in prisons, for people who once felt it was okay to injure or kill other human beings, is that criminals can effectively be taught to ""know better"". Therefore, a person who believes eating meat is immoral should feel that the same rehabilitative efforts should be made for animals who hunt other animals. As they are, it is natural for them to hunt. However, it is also natural for murderers to murder when they commit their murders. We need to change what is ""natural"" for them -- reform the animals so that they no longer feel the need to prey upon others.  Of course, aside from the fact that this sounds a bit silly, I believe it is impossible to do. This would therefore lead a person who believes eating meat is immoral to the conclusion that predatory animals need to be put down, the same way that murderers who we deem cannot be rehabilitated would be issued a death sentence. Perhaps locking up carnivorous/omnivorous animals for life-term sentences could also suffice? In any case, it would seem that severe and immediate action needs to be taken.  The only way I feel you can get around this is to find a successful way of reverting wild animals' intrinsic tendencies to hunt others. But again, I do not feel like this is a realistic possibility.  Maybe I am just a bit tired or out of it, but I am strangely and surprisingly convinced by this line of reasoning. Thoughts?  **EDIT:** Not that it was really coming up in discussion so far or anything, but I did want to mention that I am pescatarian, and also support vegetarianism and veganism. Just a bit of (possibly unnecessary) background on me, if anything.  **EDIT 2:** This might be a clearer explanation of my view:  Let's just consider Person A who believes eating meat is wrong because it takes the life of another sentient being without its consent. Animals who hunt other animals take the lives of other sentient beings without their consent. Therefore, Person A believes that these predatory animals are doing something wrong. Person A should then feel that it is right for these animals to stop doing something wrong.  This may or may not represent my stance entirely (I am not quite sure myself), but it is at least a good summary of it.  **Final EDIT:** I think I am fairly satisfied with how this CMV turned out. Thanks for all your replies! It was simply a strange thought that I felt would be fun to try to argue about, but the CMV yielded some interesting conversations, at least for me.

My reasoning was basically that animals feel pain and seem to feel emotions like fear (different animals to different extents). If there is no need for me to cause pain to an animal capable of experiencing it in order for me to meet my nutritional requirements then it is immoral for me to do so. I can in fact get all the nutrition required for healthy living without consuming products that cause animals to suffer, so I feel it is most moral for me to do so.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In fact I still feel that what I wrote above holds even though I eat meat now (we&amp;#39;re all flawed I guess). My first girlfriend was horribly allergic to soy, and lots of other things including chocolate. She would be hard pressed to get enough protein in her diet without meat due to her dietary restrictions. I never considered it immoral for her to eat meat even though I felt it was immoral for me to do so. If I were to try to enforce my beliefs about moral dieting on others (something I wouldn&amp;#39;t do btw) it would have to be very conditional. I might say that I think it would be best and most moral if humans who live in areas where plant based nutrients can efficiently provide for sufficient nutrition for people to be healthy to avoid consuming animal products and to stop maintaining a massive factory farming system for the production of animals for slaughter. I think this would be good for the environment, good for human health and ethical with regards to how humans treat animals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This wouldn&amp;#39;t be practical for many regions and many cultures at the moment and so it wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense to view them as immoral for their dietary choices and food producing practices. Even if I held to an absolute moral conviction that humans eating meat is wrong, it still wouldn&amp;#39;t make sense to apply that to animals. The predator prey relationships that make up life for wild animals is key to the balance of lots of different biological and natural systems. Forcibly removing all predation from the wild would cause massive harm to even cute cuddly herbivores everywhere within a few animal generations, so it wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily be moral. Also killing all the predators would be its own moral conundrum.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;tl;dr summation would be that the morality of consuming meat needs to be conditional and qualified to really make any sense at all, and that being the case it just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to apply it to animals or even all people everywhere. Even if you assume it to be an absolute moral principle that eating meat is always and everywhere wrong, acting on that principle would be absurd and create absurd outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cats will die without eating meat. They literally cannot survive as vegetarians. To rehabilitate them is to murder them, thus circumventing the goal not to kill any animals. I&amp;#39;m sure there are a number of other animals that are the same way. I mean, can you seriously see us capturing all the sharks and larger fish in the sea to ensure they only eat fish vegetarian fish food? Which I doubt sharks and carnivorous fish can actually survive on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, moral rules that apply to human beings don&amp;#39;t necessarily apply to animals. Not all of them are capable of being trained out of certain behaviours, like eating hunting. Furthermore, not all animals have other options. Human beings can live as vegetarians because we can purchase and consume supplements and substitutes for meat, the same can&amp;#39;t be said of animals. It would be an absurd task to capture all animals, produce meat substitutes, and feed them just to prevent them from hunting - and we would need to capture them to ensure the task was followed through because you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to train them all not to hunt. We haven&amp;#39;t succeeded with dogs, they&amp;#39;ll still go off and kill squirrels from time to time, and we&amp;#39;ve had them domesticated for ages. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It would be unethical because 1) we&amp;#39;d be capturing them against their consent and keeping them in sub-par living conditions 2) we wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to feed them enough to ensure they all have a good quality of life and that would lead to them leading unhappy short lives. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A cat doesn&amp;#39;t feel guilt for killing a mouse - nor should it. It doesn&amp;#39;t have the rational capacity to understand the ramifications of taking another life. It would be absurd to punish it for something it cannot understand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"I believe, from a nonreligious and completely logic-based view, that since we respect human life, abortion, until we learn WHEN life begins, should be considered murder and should be handled by the states, to protect the rights of what, at the very least, could be a human life. CMV.","I mean, my religious views are not related to this. I consider human life to be important, and even if I don't consider it important, the country is founded upon protecting human right to life. So we can't just logically say that a person isn't a person until they're born, or some other arbitrary landmark, and if we were going to ever find a point where human life ""begins"", it would be through the work of science, not morality police. It seems pretty apparent that humans become living, at what I would consider the point of conception.  So the safest Type I vs Type II scenario that plays safest for our rights (I consider a right to life more strong than a woman's right to do something to her reproductive organs, therefore I'd rather risk the former than the latter) is to consider it murder for the time being.  This, of course, falls under the jurisdiction of the state, not the federal government, and it would allow any state to consider it ""legal"" if they wanted to (or pass it down to a lower level), but I, personally, would disagree with this practice for the reasons above.  I'm actually stepping out on a limb here. I've spent years forming this opinion and I'm 100% confident in it, so I'm looking for anything legitimately logical to counter it.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe, from a nonreligious and completely logic-based view&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How is your view completely logic-based? Is it derived entirely from first principles? I&amp;#39;m not sure what the purpose of this line is other than to assure us that your opinions are logically correct. (This isn&amp;#39;t directed completely at you, OP. I&amp;#39;ve seen this repeatedly in CMV titles and it seems to smack of &lt;a href=""/r/atheism""&gt;/r/atheism&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So we can&amp;#39;t just logically say that a person isn&amp;#39;t a person until they&amp;#39;re born, or some other arbitrary landmark&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Why can&amp;#39;t we logically say that?

When we can recognize that life as human is a different story -- almost certainly somewhere between 5 and 24 weeks. Something that doesn&amp;#39;t have a spinal cord, heart or brain cannot remotely be called human; on the other hand, once it can survive out of the womb it&amp;#39;s hard to argue that it&amp;#39;s not a person.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seems pretty apparent that humans become living, at what I would consider the point of conception.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s very apparent at all. A zygote or blastocyst is a collection of cells that is utterly unrecognizable as human. Only around 8-9 weeks do we get something that has the organs that we recognize as making a human being.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for your legal section: Abortion cannot be outlawed in the US (by state or federal government), even if the law describes it as murder, since abortion bans are illegal under the federal Constitution as currently understood.

They&amp;#39;re brain dead. Now, in this scenario I think you&amp;#39;ll find that most people won&amp;#39;t object to pulling the plug in a hypothetical. This person is no longer a person, it&amp;#39;s just a body. Sure, it&amp;#39;s still technically alive, should we persecute doctors for murder when they pull the plug?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The time period in which abortion is allowed the fetus is basically just some developing cells completely dependent on their host.

"Reading fiction / fantasy novels, comics, manga (etc.) are no more beneficial, cognitively, than watching television. CMV","As a somewhat avid reader of sci/fi fantasy novels, and more recently, a watcher of such dramas as Game of Thrones or Suits (which I highly recommend btw), i've come to the conclusion that the experience and pleasure I gain from partaking of these stories is no more or less dissimilar than if I were to read them (and in most cases I have).  I think the crusade to instill more reading in young adults or people in general is from an unnecessary need to feel superior to the easy stereotype that those who watch television are uneducated, mindless slops.  It is my opinion that reading fiction is merely a distraction, and, beyond the increase of vocabulary that may come with it, the cognitive exercise to be had is indistinguishable from that which can be attained from watching a play, or drama, or documentary. For example, can you learn to read body language, emotion, and acting from reading a book, or from watching an actor? Who says one cannot increase their vocabulary verbally rather than visually?  I know this is largely anecdotal but I am stressed for time. I look forward to your arguments  ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I would indeed argue that these two activities both present &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; cognitive challenges/advantages, I think that you&amp;#39;re missing at least a couple of significant differences:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) Any given book about a topic contains far more non-visual information than a TV show about the topic. In 1/2 hour, I can watch a TV chef prepare perhaps 2 dishes, and indeed I will learn many things about those 2 tasks that I wouldn&amp;#39;t learn by reading a recipe book, but in that same time I could read and understand perhaps 20-30 recipes. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) A visual adaptation of a book always loses a great deal in the translation. It gains visual richness, but at the cost of loss of plot, character introspection/development (it&amp;#39;s almost impossible to portray a character&amp;#39;s thoughts in a movie), and complexity. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) Visual media remove a large part of the exercise of imagination that comes from reading books. Everything that is there is there to see, you need not imagine anything. When reading a book, you intrinsically are converting from an abstract record of events into a mental image of those same events. This cognitive activity is very valuable, and the ability to convert written abstract ideas into ideas in your mind is very valuable in the workplace... which leads to... &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4) Reading good literature improves your ability to write well/cogently, and expressing yourself in writing is a very large part of modern information work. There is almost no call for presenting your work/ideas in visual form beyond a powerpoint presentation (which is primarily writing). Of course, this could change in the future, but it&amp;#39;s unlikely to ever encompass the kinds of abstract work that people need to do today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you open to the idea of medium specificity? That certain experiences can never be truly replicated in other mediums. In other words, their is something specific in mediums which allow them accomplish unique &amp;#39;experiences and pleasures&amp;#39; other mediums can never quite do, because these works rely on  essential qualities of their mediums. In other words, when the experience is composed using a medium&amp;#39;s essential qualities, it makes sense you can&amp;#39;t 100% replicate unless &lt;em&gt;you have&lt;/em&gt; the medium&amp;#39;s essential qualities present.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As an example I&amp;#39;m going to rely on fine arts since the idea is easier to convey. So, like a painting does utilize narrative, but has specific qualities which seperate it from other mediums, &lt;a href=""http://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/van-gogh-wheatfield-1889-granger.jpg""&gt;like this painting&lt;/a&gt; It utilizes the limit of the picture plane to make it&amp;#39;s composition and is trying to convey how endless and majestic the field is by allowing it to take up so much space. Brush strokes are used to give a unique experience of whirliness, that is easy to get lost in, and is contrasted by the straightness of adjacent brushstrokes, helping to make the field stand out and feel unique to the rest of the painting. If this whirliness were moving (like in a film), it would change the experience. If it were made into a scultpure, you lose the composition, since it no longer has a picture plane. Their would be no brushstrokes, no vagueness to the characters. You would be able to move around and view it as you please, rather than the stillness the pictures alludes. Likewise, &lt;a href=""http://enjoyillinoisblog.com/2010/05/gsu-sculpture-park.jpg""&gt;a sculpture&lt;/a&gt; has a physical presence that can never be replicated by a painting. You could feasibly make a painting of this specific scene, but it doesn&amp;#39;t necesarrily replicate the experience of seeing it in person; the overwhelming presence of it. Each of these mediums rely on different mechanisms which enable them to convey different experiences. As I see it, it doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily make one medium better than the other, but rather makes each one viable as a unique seperate experience. Kind of like arguing that Indian food is superior to Japanese food, so one should never consume Japanese food. But they each convey different experiences, so the more ideal situation would be to enjoy and experience both, even if you happen to favor one. I think the popular way of saying it is &amp;quot;Apples and Oranges&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think certain things are very translatable because they rely purely on plot and character. Other things will tend to rely on how these things interact with the form and medium elements or rely on those entirely (like poetry for example), and as a result become close to untranslatable between mediums. On the Road is a good example of something that is just nigh-impossible to translate due to it&amp;#39;s extremely heavy reliance on language-play.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*Edit - removed redundant point&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: Taxpayer funded research should be freely available to any citizen upon first publication.,"edit: Thanks to some discussion with posters and links to recent changes in [NIH policy](http://publicaccess.nih.gov/policy.htm) and [U.S. policy](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/01/17/half-of-taxpayer-funded-research-will-soon-be-available-to-the-public/) I've conceded that my ""upon first publication point"" may be too dramatic. I think making the published research open access is still important, but have conceded that it should be done after a reasonable time frame. NIH says 1 year, the U.S. government says 6 months.  edit: As /u/Maxzines (and others) pointed out [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2lsokk/cmv_taxpayer_funded_research_should_be_freely/clxtd8i) I didn't make it clear that I meant private projects and research done at universities or colleges. Defense departments should be able to do research in secret.  I am speaking purely from an American perspective but I do genuinely feel that this issue should extend to all countries.  My argument is as follows:    1. Acceptance of funds from any single person or group makes that entity an investor in that research.     2. An investor in research should have access to the end results of that research.     3. If a researcher accepts government grants to fund their research then that government, and by extension its citizens, have become an investor and should have free access to the published work.  To clarify I am indeed saying that acceptance of any amount of government funding should lead to free access to the published work, regardless of if it is $1 or $100,000. Change my view, what is wrong about this line of thought?  edit: To further clarify I am talking purely about publication of scientific research. I am in a sense arguing for the legislation of a requirement to publish government funded research in an [open access journal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_journal). _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I don't think Incest is a big deal at all. CMV?,"If homosexuality is okay, why is incest wrong? I fully support homosexuality and most people tend to agree with me on this, but they look down on me when I compare homosexuality to incest.  AS LONG as they don't have children, what's wrong with it? They could adopt if they wanted children, just like gay couples do.  I still feel weird about Incest due to social conditioning and whatnot but I realise it's practically the same as straight and gay love... If you argue that it's weird because they come from the same bloodline, that's not really an argument, more of a statement like when people say ""but they're both the same gender..."" and Incest is observed in nature and even a part of evolution.  I would never practice incest, nor would I have sex with a person of the same gender but that's just me and how I feel, but I support them both. Would you really take away the rights of some people? The same rights that homosexuals have fought so hard to get, even interracial marriage some time ago.  I'm definitely open to changing my mind, but right now I see nothing wrong with it.  PS. I'm not asking this question for myself, I don't ""love"" my relatives like that at all, I'm just curious about these subjects.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stigma surrounding incest is nearly universal among cultures, and appears to be biological in origin. Specifically, a revulsion to sexual interaction with people with whom one lived from the ages of four to ten appears to be normal, and it seems to be an adaptation for preventing incestuous copulation (since brother-sister incest limits genetic diversity quite strongly, and produces major birth defects over just a few generations). This was probably only necessary because of other factors that make people who seem genetically similar more sexually attractive. Without this adaptation, incest would probably be significantly more common than non-incestuous relationships -- with major negative effects on the gene pool.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is to say that it&amp;#39;s not a rational reaction, but it&amp;#39;s one that makes sense for individuals to adopt. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, because it&amp;#39;s biological in origin and appears to be based on imprinting, it&amp;#39;s prone to some pretty strange failure conditions. An only child living outside a communal setting will see nothing wrong with sibling incest unless culturally programmed to, because s/he has not received the imprint, so places with fairly stable economies where reproduction is below replacement rate quickly lose the cultural taboo for incest. Siblings raised apart (say, separated at birth and meeting two decades later without knowing about their shared lineage) are still fairly likely to find each other extremely sexually attractive. Genetically unrelated people who grow up together (stepbrothers and stepsisters, classmates in places where people aren&amp;#39;t shuffled between different classrooms throughout elementary school) are unlikely to engage in sexual relationships despite lack of genetic relation because of this effect, as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;EDIT: turns out that the westermark effect is no longer accepted, and that at least one meta-study indicates that it seems to be bullshit: &lt;a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-011-1145-y#page-1""&gt;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00265-011-1145-y#page-1&lt;/a&gt; . So, I retract my claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that through time, people have understood that incest is wrong not specifically under the terms of immorality [when considering that both parties are consensual adults] but under the consideration of maintaining a healthy gene pool. It would have been observed that inbreeding causes a collapse in the genetic health of a population. Back in hunter gatherer times, and even in the primate world, there are inbuilt selective protocols for ensuring that genetic diversity  is maintained – either females leave to go to other tribes or males leave to look for females. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many cultures have elaborate mating law for who you can or cannot marry based on how closely related they are to you, the Australian Aboriginals have one, a very intricate one based on ‘skin’ clan groups. It has the effect of making incest a taboo. Now the basis of it is to keep the population healthy. However, way back when, people didn’t understand the genetic mechanics of it all, just that when there was inbreeding, the offspring ended up retarded. This may have been understood in a moral capacity [spiritual or religious] because people didn’t know how ELSE to understand it or even to enforce it, even though the considerations here are purely about keeping the tribe healthy. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On a personal level, it is wrong in the sense that your children will have more of a chance of being retarded and it damages your own genetic legacy as well as the lives of those you produce… so it’s a betrayal to the 3.5 billion years of successful reproduction that has come before you. I would say that this is how the wrongness of it can be understood in relation to how it can damage the health of people, your personal genetic fitness and legacy, and ‘the tribe’. Homosexuality can reduce a person’s individual fitness [fitness here is about how many offspring you leave, it’s an evolutionary term] but not necessarily that of other people or the tribe in a direct physical sense. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
I believe you should never hold a belief so firm that your mind cannot be changed. CMV,"In the pursuit of open-mindedness i am here to challenge one of the things i believe most firmly. That belief is in open-mindedness itself. I believe that everyone should always be open to opposing view points  You should never assume you are 100% right about anything. There is always benefit to considering you are wrong. Either you will find out that you were right after examining the other side fairly and have a stronger argument in the future, or you will find out you were wrong and hopefully benefit from now being right.   An example of some one who didn't do this is Ken Ham in the last debate: When Ken Ham was asked if there was anything that could change his mind, he said nothing would ever change his mind and admitted he couldn’t even imagine a hypothetical scenario in which he was wrong.  I believe that Ken Ham's certainty of himself and his views is wrong and that no one should ever do that. I also have family members that are the same way. They wouldn't change their mind on their religious beliefs no matter what evidence was given to the contrary.  So my question is, is there any reason whatsoever to hold a belief so firmly that your mind cannot be changed? CMV.  Edit: Thanks everyone for responding to my post. I want to say that my view has been changed. ""I believe that you should actively question any beliefs you hold where a differing opinion exists"". This a quote by Karl Popper provided by /u/meatrocket78. This means we don't need to question that 1+1=2 and whether or not we exist and the like, but we should question things like the existence of God, Religion, Politics, etc. /u/ezhuang  also gave an example of a moral dilemma where he said he would not want to change his mind on the subject, because that truth would be so detrimental to everything he believes that he would rather reject it. This helped me understand Ken Ham's view. It becomes highly personal at that point and I don't think that I hold any views like that but I at least understand the people that do. Thanks Everyone!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if i would say &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt;. I have certain beliefs that i am not willing to change my mind on.

This is superior to subjective things because it can convince others of said truth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your argument also brings up an interesting question like what is a belief? Is Evolution a belief? Is God a belief? Are certain conspiracy theories beliefs? There is a big grey area where truth and belief mix.

I believe vegans and vegetarians who choose their diets for ethical reasons rather than simple taste or health reasons are irrational and misinformed. CMV.,"First off, let me say that I fully understand the health benefits of both of these lifestyles. I also fully understand that some people just don't like meat. I have no question challenging either of those stances. My confusion occurs where people say, ""it's wrong to kill animals, so I won't eat them"" or ""animal suffering is just as bad as human suffering. You wouldn't consume things that a human wrongly suffered to make, so why would you eat meat and animal products?""   In response to the first view, the norm today is not that one goes out to kill an animal and eat it. Rather, you go to the supermarket, buy it, cook it, eat it. One person saying, ""no, I won't buy that"" isn't enough to affect the demand. As a result, the same number of animals will be killed and that person's vegetarianism or veganism will make no difference. And that's just the counter to that argument from a pragmatic standpoint. On an ethical level, I don't buy at all that it's wrong to kill animals. Assuming we eliminate religion from the argument (another reason for either of these diets that I have no problem understanding), humans are essentially nothing more than the highest cognitively functioning animals. We're not going to feed a lion ""meat"" made of soy protein and nobody has a problem with them mauling an antelope. The counter to that would be, but lions can only eat meat. Fine, replace lions with any omnivorous animal that could survive solely on plants. Again, nobody has a problem with that animal killing and eating another animal. I understand animals don't have the capacity to reason like we do (although evidence points to even that being debatable), but nobody claims that because I have the ability to feed a homeless man that I have a duty to do the same.   With regards to the argument from the stance of suffering, I think it's unsound. Nike is one of the most popular brands of shoes in the world. A lot of Nike shoes are made by humans who wrongly suffer. I'm not condoning this fact, but it is a fact. Assuming it was sound though, I don't buy that dying equates to suffering. If someone walks up to me and puts a bullet in my brainstem, I haven't felt pain nor have I suffered. I'm just dead. Now, one could say that the suffering occurs in the way certain farms raise animals for slaughter. Even if I grant that, that doesn't preclude all meat and animal products. There are plenty of farms that humanely raise animals for slaughter and for certain products like milk and such.   With all this in mind, CMV.   Edit: A lot of you guys have made some great points. I think my issue is that, while I now understand better that being vegetarian or vegan is morally commendable, I still don't (and doubt I ever will) believe it's morally obligatory. Given that I don't think it's morally obligatory, I don't necessarily feel compelled to become vegetarian or vegan because it's not a cause I care enough about (I know I made mention of the homeless man and not being obligated to help, but for those of you who are curious, I think the global poor are far more deserving of attention than the treatment of animals and of you're curious, I recommend Thomas Pogge's book, *Politics as Usual*). Far be it from me to tell you how you should feel about it though. I won't have time to respond to all the questions you guys might have for me, but all of your points are well taken. As a generalization, I no longer believe vegans and vegetarians who choose their diets for ethical reasons are irrational and ill informed. Thanks!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not the president of vegetarianism so I hardly claim to speak for anyone but myself, but as a non-religious ethical vegetarian I feel compelled to respond to this post.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your main arguments seem to me to be that: individual action (via consumer choice) does not make a difference; it is natural to eat meat; humans suffer in the world (and that should be a higher priority); and that killing an animal does not necessarily equate to suffering. I&amp;#39;ll try to address each and all of these, in order.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that individual actions in the form of shopping behaviors &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; make a difference. The plural of individual action eventually becomes &amp;quot;trend&amp;quot; and it&amp;#39;s that sort of data that food producers and grocery stores respond to. &lt;a href=""http://www.researchscape.com/health/meat-consumption-trends""&gt;Meat consumption is down&lt;/a&gt; in the US (where I live), and that is at least partly attributable to vegetarianism and other reduced-meat diets. I can say from experience that it is significantly easier to be vegetarian now than it was 10 years ago when I started - Chipotle now offers tofu, Burger King has a veggie burger, grocery stores have larger and more robust vegetarian areas. If you believe capitalism works, which I do, then you&amp;#39;ll understand the power of consumers to dictate market trends. Businesses go where the money is, and if the money is in organic or vegetarian meals, they&amp;#39;ll be there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; argument, I would argue that it&amp;#39;s pretty irrelevant. It&amp;#39;s an &lt;a href=""http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Hume&amp;#x27;s_law""&gt;is-ought problem&lt;/a&gt;. Just because we (as in animals in general) have natural dispositions or proclivities toward eating meat doesn&amp;#39;t mean it is necessarily moral to do so. Given that we have the capability to reason, we have a moral obligation to act in accordance with our reason. As for animal morality, I suppose that would depend on whether or not animals are capable of making higher-level moral decisions. I do believe that animals are more intelligent than most people give them credit for, but that doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily translate into self-awareness or higher-level cognition. I would say that, in an absolute sense, a lion killing a gazelle is an immoral act, but unless that lion is capable of pondering its actions, it is essentially blameless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for human suffering, I think this is not an argument against vegetarianism at all. It&amp;#39;s entirely possible to avoid buying leather shoes while at the same time also avoiding sweatshop labor shoes. It&amp;#39;s entirely possible to feed starving individuals and nations with vegetarian diets (in fact, it may be more beneficial to do so). There&amp;#39;s no law that says that vegetarians have to be blind to human suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the specific moral argument for vegetarianism, there are a few and I don&amp;#39;t really know what your moral belief structure is, so any appeal I make will be essentially a shot in the dark as to whether you buy it. I encourage you to read up &lt;a href=""http://puffin.creighton.edu/phil/stephens/fiveargumentsforvegetarianism.htm""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and see which one you feel most drawn to and then find the initial source. That said, I&amp;#39;ll make the argument that influenced my decision, which is simple probability. Say you&amp;#39;re in a room with a door on both your left and your right, a desk with 2 buttons on it and a speaker overhead. The speaker comes on and a person tells you that the 2 doors lead to different possibilities. If you press the left button, the left door will unlock and you&amp;#39;ll have to sit in an uncomfortable chair for 2 minutes, at which point you will be free to leave. If you press the right button, the right door will unlock and you&amp;#39;ll have the option to sit in a comfortable chair for 2 minutes, at which point you&amp;#39;re free to leave. However, if you press the right button there is a nonzero chance that you&amp;#39;ll detonate a nuclear warhead somewhere in the world. You don&amp;#39;t know where it will be or what the probability of that detonation are, but you know it&amp;#39;s a possibility. I would argue that it&amp;#39;s immoral to press the right button, because even though you&amp;#39;ll be slightly convenienced, there is a chance that you&amp;#39;ll act in a way that&amp;#39;s very immoral. Eating meat, to me, is pressing the button on the right (I know it&amp;#39;s hyperbolic, it&amp;#39;s an example). There is a chance that the way I&amp;#39;m acting by eating meat is immoral, and there&amp;#39;s relatively little risk to me in simply avoiding that possibility entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;One person saying, &amp;quot;no, I won&amp;#39;t buy that&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t enough to affect the demand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is rather blatantly fallacious for a number of reasons.  There are currently millions of vegetarians, so are you going to honestly propose to me that if every one of those individuals all of a sudden accepted your reasoning here and started eating meat again, that this would have no effect on demand?  This is obviously untrue.  What this also means is that the individual&amp;#39;s effect on demand is not zero, because if it were zero, you would multiply the total number of vegetarians by zero to find what the effect would be if they all started eating meat, which is obviously not zero.  So what it is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; accurate to say is that the effect of one individual is somewhat small.  It is is an effect nonetheless though, and if you&amp;#39;d ever looked up the statistics on how many entire animals the average human eats in their lifetime, you&amp;#39;d realize that it is much larger than you probably think.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;nobody has a problem with that animal killing and eating another animal&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are a number of things wrong with this as well.  The first being:  since when do you take your cues for how to act appropriately from &lt;em&gt;wild animals&lt;/em&gt;?  You know what, wild animals rape each other all the time.  In light of this, am I now going to hear you argue that we should be fine with rape too, &amp;quot;because animals do it&amp;quot;?  This line of argument is an appeal to nature fallacy, because it acts like just because something is natural, it is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; for us to do.  We don&amp;#39;t base our actions and standards on how wild animals act.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The next problem is pretty much exactly what you said:  animals are generally not moral agents because they don&amp;#39;t have a conception of morality.  We &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; however, so pointing to an amoral agent can do nothing to inform us, as moral agents, how we should act.  That&amp;#39;s the equivalent of pointing to a sociopath and going &amp;quot;Well &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t have a problem with serial killing, so &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; shouldn&amp;#39;t either!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t buy that dying equates to suffering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The main argument is about how animals are treated prior to their death, and considering that essentially all meat produced comes from factory farms, this is what matters.  The amount of meat produced by small mom and pop farms would not feed the population of long island alone, so their existence is essentially negligible when trying to determine how one should act in the real world, even if it were granted that this was an acceptable source (which is questionable in itself).  The animals produced by these factory farms endure unfathomable levels of suffering, and every time you pay the farm for their services, you encourage more of it.  You are getting your meat from the people who torture animals for nearly their whole lives, and this is what is argued to be the primary ethical problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: TwoXChromosomes is the worst subreddit of all for people actually wanting to participate in a subreddit because it positions itself as one thing but delivers another in a personally offensive way.,"There are subreddits that are worse than TwoX on the surface because the subreddits exist for just plain evil - like the racist subreddits or subreddits glorifying violence and such. But these subreddits don't pretend to be anything other than they are; users know what it is and know what they're participating in. Other users stay away and never participate on those subreddits.   With TwoX, the surface of the subreddit is a place for women's issues and discussions about being a woman. But what is actually delivered is a subreddit in which the intended users of the subreddit are bombarded with negativity from other users. So now you have users who *think* they're participating in a supportive subreddit meant for women's perspectives, but end up being responded to by antagonizing users who argue against women's perspectives and play devil's advocate. Downvotes reinforce this as well. Often this is personally offensive to the woman who submitted the thread or posted the comment being responded to.  This happened when TwoX became a default subreddit. Other default subreddits have the same problem of users not realizing what subreddit they're in and making comments that go against the spirit or rules of the subreddit, but this problem cuts the deepest in TwoX because the topics are so personal. When someone makes an inappropriate joke comment in r/history, it gets deleted, and the thread can look sparse, but nobody is typically personally offended. But in TwoX, on the other hand, when someone makes a comment that goes against the spirit of the subreddit, the comment is typically an attack of a person or idea or feeling (because those are the things typically discussed in the subreddit - unlike history, for example), and so people do get personally offended.   This all combines to make TwoXChromosomes the worst subreddit of all for the typical user who actually wants to participate in it.   ----------------------  **Edit:** View has been changed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/30zgez/cmv_twoxchromosomes_is_the_worst_subreddit_of_all/cpx9iqo) because the end-result of a thread is that it does reflect the spirit of the community; it's just that my style of browsing the /new page instead of the front page of a subreddit causes me to be exposed to ""trolls"" before the rest of the community can counteract them.   However, you gotta admit, as a user of a community, it would suck to see your inbox constantly fill up with ""trolls"" even if those ""trolls"" eventually end up buried in downvotes. When you get a response to a comment, you get an inbox notification and will typically be the first person to read the comment - so you read it before it has any up or downvotes. Even if all the ""trolls"" eventually do get their comments removed, downvoted, or with many responses saying ""that's not right!,"" the person whose comment it is originally is getting all that inbox activity that really sucks. So the experience for a regular user of the subreddit still really sucks even if the end-result for someone browsing the front page is nice.   (""trolls"" in quotations because I'm using it as shorthand: by it It mean users to espouse the negativity mentioned above.) _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I have been looking at the front page of Twox as well as the top posts of the week and have not found anything resembling the problems you&amp;#39;re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you are talking about inappropriate posts that get downvoted, well, there is nothing you can really do about that.

CMV: Minority Groups Are Justified in Believing That African Americans Should Just Work Harder,"So I feel pretty bad for posting this, because I know I'll be called out as a bigot. That's why I'm hoping some of you can CMV.  However, every time I look at an argument for why African Americans don't do as well as their white counterparts, it comes down to disadvantage. They tend to live in poorer areas and go to poorer schools, and may also face workplace discrimination.  If that's the case, then why is it that Asian and Indian Americans, many of whom are first or second generation immigrants who come in with nothing more than the clothes off their backs (arguably even MORE at a disadvantage than their African American counterparts, who at least are already established in the USA), can grow up to be just as successful as their white counterparts? It's practically a stereotype that Asian and Indian children are going to grow up too be doctors or engineers! So how exactly is it that *they*, who face many of the same challenges as blacks, can grow up to be comfortably successful and well-respected in just one or two generations? The only answer I can think of is their hard work ethic...which, let's be honest, is just another way of saying ""blacks are lazy"".  I'll sum up how I feel with a quote from a user on another thread. Please don't go witch-hunting, he is in no way related to this post.  &gt;Let me give you a little background. I'm in my early 30s, I'm a second generation immigrant. I'm not white. I went to majority black schools. My grandfather was an illiterate farmer, my father worked manual labor, I'm a physician. This general pattern is &gt;true for my entire extended family, and perhaps 90% of the people of my diaspora I know.  &gt;I know there is tremendous racism and inequality, I've felt it too. I live with it as well, from both blacks and whites. Let me tell you something, I'd rather deal with white racism than black racism. White racism means I get a few funny looks walking my dog. Black racism stabs my kid for his sneakers (that's a true story, I watched that happen in high school). Black racism means that when I was in university the black woman at the desk denied me access to the ""minority study center"" and angrily told me that I was the wrong type of minority. I'd rather deal with the funny looks.  &gt;I grew up around black people, I know most of them are perfectly normal hardworking decent people. I've got a few black friends from medical school who are some of the most brilliant absolutely lovely people I've ever met. There is a problem though, the black middle class blurs very quickly with the black lower class. The black lower classes are the most fucked up unpredictable dangerous people I've ever had the misfortune of being around. I've lived around this, I know the score. I've personally seen people beaten and stabbed. My literal next door neighbor was running a dog fighting / gun-market operation. It was a comical level of stereotypical criminality. It was also fucking terrifying.  &gt;I packed my shit up. I live in a state with less than 5% black population. I live in an incredibly white area, I see perhaps one black family a year.  &gt;All your points are completely accurate, but you're missing the reason. Anyone who can avoid living around black people does it, including other black people. I don't want to be a victim of crime and I don't want my property value to go down the toilet.  &gt;My group started with a far lower standard of living and has faced the same racism. Through work and education over a couple of generations we're at the point where we have been able to elevate ourselves beyond those circumstances. I might get funny looks in my neighborhood, but I don't bring down the property values. Indians, Chinese, Russians, Polish, Vietnamese, Nigerians, Taiwanese, any other immigrant group can improve their lot within a few generations, while living in those same horrible neighborhoods. Why can't blacks? Why do we have to do it for them? Nobody did it for us. They need to fix their own situation and get to a point where people don't mind living around them.  Please CMV, I feel uncomfortable holding such a view (and in case it wasn't obvious enough already, yes I am an Asian-American).   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Basically, that all black people live in the ghetto. That&amp;#39;s not the case. What you see on the news as &amp;quot;the black community&amp;quot; are the ones that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; live in the ghetto, not the whole of the black population. The black diaspora is more diverse than that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Secondly, that all other immigrants are either boat people or refugees. That&amp;#39;s simply not true. Plenty of Asians or Indians come from relatively rich families. I can&amp;#39;t speak to specifically about the Indian community, but I know the Asian community in my city is way richer (and have ties to richer countries) than the average black community. There&amp;#39;s also a very specific subset of people that leave their country: those &amp;quot;rich&amp;quot; enough to leave. This means the average immigrant population will tend to do better (because only the better ones are coming).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, that the situation of immigrants and African Americans are equivalent or at least easily comparable. They&amp;#39;re not. Immigrants arrive in a country for what they&amp;#39;d often consider a fresh start. African Americans, however, are born to a system inherited from decades upon decades of discrimination, which has only recently stopped being institutional.   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big factor to consider is that new immigrants are a highly nonrandom sample.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is really hard to uproot your family and move to a new country.  Especially one where you&amp;#39;re not part of the mainstream culture, don&amp;#39;t know any of the language, and have little money or resources to start with.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The kind of people who see all those hurdles and do it anyway are going to be, on average, smarter, more ambitious, and harder working than normal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Average Indians don&amp;#39;t move to America.  Exceptionally ambitious Indians move to America, because moving to America is hard and scary.  It shouldn&amp;#39;t be surprising that them and their children are unusually successful, despite hurdles of racism and discrimination.  If they were going to have an average reaction to those hurdles, they wouldn&amp;#39;t have overcome all the extra hurdles that come with immigration, and would still be in their home countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"I believe that, though climate change exists, it is NOT caused by humans. CMV","I believe that global warming is happening right now. I believe that glaciers are melting and the temperature is getting hotter. Yet what I do not believe is the fact that all of this is caused by people ""polluting the environment"".

"CMV: As an environmental engineer, I give up! PLEASE CMV!","Greetings  I am an environmental engineer, with a degree in environment and land management. I have studied and dedicated my professional life to make a change on our world, to make this planet a better place for future generations and protect it from those that would exploit it for greed and short term gain.  After 15 years of working in the field I am ready to give up. The fact is most people don't give a shit about our planet and the legacy we are leaving for future generations. I have worked hard, sometimes more than 70 hours a week, to see all that I have accomplished destroyed by short sighted corporations and the uncaring government that work for them.  I have been called a useless hippy who works only to stifle profits, I have seen the depths of which government and corporations will go to fuck us all for short term gains and I have lived for many years barely breaking even and financially keeping myself afloat because most environmental jobs that aren't about exploiting the system to maximize a companies profits pays for shit.  Well now I have a wife, a son, banks who are hounding me night and day to pay back my student loans and the dream of offering a better life for my family. This week I have been offered two new career opportunity. One is to manage a non profit organisation dedicated to protecting the last vestiges of forests and wetlands around the city i live in (while paying only 13$/h). The other is for a big construction company, to make sure that it is compliant with the pathetic environmental regulations while it bulldozes over the last natural ecosystems we have (but for more money per month than I ever made in a year)  I am to give my decision next week and I am truly considering for the first time in my life to give up my principals and go work for the money. I need somebody to change my views, but I am so tired of living poor, of not being respected and of seeing all my work be for nothing.  Edit: Wow I am getting finger cramps from replying to all of these great posts (very few of them were not so great ... you know who you are!) I sincerely thank you all for contributing to this great discussion. I have made this post as a whimsical experiment... I have already discussed about my career choice with my wife and close family and I have already come to a decision considering what to do with my immediate future. I just wanted to anonymously find out what the reddit community thought about my hard decision and I have been more than happily suprised with the response. This is the essence of what makes reddit so great... Many thanks to all of you... I will continue to respond to as many comments as I can and tomorrow I will update this post with my final decision and the reasons why I chose it.     Final decision Edit: First I would like to thank you all for this awesome CMV. It went way beyond what I had ever expected and I don't think I have ever spent so much time typing since my time at university. Like I said in the previous edit, I had already reached a decision by consulting my wife, my friends and my family, but all the incredible advice and the insightful comment gave me great hope that my decision will be the right one for my career, myself and my family. So here it goes  I have decided to take the construction industry job for the following reasons:  - Right now it is an awful time to be working in the non-profit NGO, where I live. The conservative government has slashed all funding in the environment sector and the provincial government only cares about austerity. If I took the NGO job, I wouldn't even be guarantied to be able to keep it for very long if the meager funding dries out.  - I have been working in the same field, with the same people for over 15 years. I am feel enthusiastic about learning new things and working with new people. Also if I learn the inner workings of the construction industry, I may become much more efficient to enact long term meaningful changes.  - I have been living poor (well much more then most engineer do) for the past 15 and I still have some student loans to reimburse. Banks have constantly been picking at my heels and it will be quite a load of my stress, if I can finally repay then and make then STFU! Also having some form of financial stability would be great for a change.  - Although where I live, our society has quite the safety net and I am assured that my child will never lack of his basic needs whatever salary I make, It would be great to offer my family a better quality of life. Rest assured I am not someone who will have more money go to his head. By nature, I am not a great consumer and I am very likely to put most of my money aside for personal projects and even help out the NGO I had worked for and respect.  - I have dedicated my entire life to fight for the environment and that in not about to change, even if I work in a different field. Over the years I have found that enacting change from the outside of a system is next to impossible, so it will be quite interesting to see if change can be had from the inside.   - My greatest fear is that the construction job asks me to compromise to much on my value and that makes me fall into a depression. In order to prevent this scenario, I will be following the advice given by many of you. Quickly put money aside, so I can safely bail out if thing get to rough and have multiple contingency plan if ever it does.   - Finally I must admit that the money does sound attractive. I never had a job that pays so much and I never thought I would. However having grown in a wealthy (relatively speaking) family, I know first hand that money doesn't buy happiness, it just makes misery very comfortable. Since I am a woodsman and love working outdoors comforts aren't that important to me, but it's been forever since I have dreamed of visiting the different forests around the world and for the first time in my life, I may actually be able to do that (If I ever get some vacation time... a concept that is equally alien to me)   Once again many thanks to all the people who commented on my CMV post (yes even the trolls, their idiotic antics proved somewhat entertaining) I wish you all the very best of luck in your endeavours and if anyone wants to help me in my quest to make this world a better place, feel free to go out an plant a tree.

"CMV: sex should be treated as just an activity that people do, like fishing or watching a movie.","Listed for easier rebuttal and addressing:  1. Putting a big amount of value on sex by seeing it as something to only do with one person can create tension later on in a relationship due to sexual incompatibility.   2. It is an integral part of a relationship, so by lessening the value on sex can allow people to explore this part of a relationship.  3. By treating it as just another activity to enjoy, it allows relationships to be built on other things such as trust, communication, emotional intimacy, etc.   I personally believe that putting sex on a pedestal is potentially harmful to society and people in relationships. Thus, we should reduce the value of sex in society. CMV!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most activities, including fishing and watching a movie, do not involve the deep level of collaboration that sex does. To enjoyably watch a movie with someone, we might need to know basic things about each other&amp;#39;s preferences--whether to talk about things as they happen or stay quiet and wait til the end to comment, for example. But, for many people, the best sex comes from having extensive knowledge of what the other person likes, both physically and psychologically. It makes sense, therefore, to focus on building sexual rapport with a limited number of people, rather than having sex with whomever happens to be available.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As others have mentioned, there&amp;#39;s also a biological component. Attraction increases arousal, and sex, in turn, has, according to some studies, been linked to increased production of oxytocin, which promotes social bonding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sex has a profound effect on brain chemistry. In particular, the release of oxytocin. I can&amp;#39;t say I completely understand it, but I think it&amp;#39;s safe to say that you don&amp;#39;t get oxytocin from regular activities like fishing. Oxytocin is called the bonding hormone because it causes you to trust/love whoever is stimulating it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"I can't help but think that some children who are born with terminal birth defects would be better off euthanized, please CMV","I feel guilty even thinking this but every time I go over it in my head I reach the same conclusion.  Whenever I read about some crippling disease on Wikipedia with almost no chance of surviving until adulthood and a severely reduced quality of life I can't help but think that the child and the parents might be better off if they just said goodbye after the diagnosis.  I know that sounds awful but I cannot imagine how it could be worse than watching your child slowly die in extreme pain over the course of several years.  You could compare this to people who get diagnosed with a terminal disease in adulthood but I feel like an adult could use the time they have left to say goodbye and put their affairs in order. When a child is born already dying there isn't a lot that they could do in that time except form close bonds with people that will all-to-soon be painfully broken by their inevitable death.  I really don't want to hold this opinion anymore, please change my view.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I was in San Francisco last weekend and the homeless population was just heartbreaking.

I realized that even with the best mental/physical care in the world, many of these people are just beyond being able to be helped to the point where they can become self-sustainable. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The thought crossed my mind that maybe everyone would be better off if we offered to painlessly euthanize any of these individuals who &lt;strong&gt;voluntarily&lt;/strong&gt; decided they no longer wanted to live but didn&amp;#39;t want to go through the pain of actually harming themselves.

Brony's obsession with a child show is unhealthy and they should seek psychiatric help. Please CMV.,"It actually sickens me to see grown men watching a children's show with the level obsession it has. It makes me uncomfortable and when I have kids I probably will even feel uncomfortable with stumbling upon the weird sexualized (I know its only sexualized to some, but its still out there) undertone the community full of ""mature"" adults has put around it. The reason I think they should seek psychiatric help is because it seems to be a reversion to a younger age type thing in my book. I've only taken an intro level psychology course in high school but one thing I learned was that trying to revert back to a more immature age is a sign of frustration or anger at themselves.   TL;DR It's a kids show and I think that the people who watch it have actual mental issues including frustration towards their own lives.   Thanks, and please CMV  edit: **View changed, deltas awarded.

You can look at something like Star Wars or even Star Trek as an example.  Those stories are certainly written on a level so that the average 8 year old can understand them, but that doesn&amp;#39;t make them shows for children.  they&amp;#39;re made for most audiences.  Even some kid&amp;#39;s shows put &amp;quot;extra stuff&amp;quot; in for parents who watch the show with their kids.  Sesame Street quite often references pop culture or has famous people (Jimmy Fallon for example) come on to sing a song.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the flaw in the view.

Their dedication to the show makes me think that it is a well-written show, which has more to offer then just sexy ponies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure there might be some crazy people who like MLP, but that does not mean everybody who likes it is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"I don't think ""ending the R-word"" is a worthwhile goal. CMV.","For those who are unfamiliar with the campaigns to ""end the R-word,"" it is essentially a movement to stop the use of the word ""retarded"" being used as an insult or as a casual descriptor for something being dumb. The reasons for this are that it is insulting to those who actually have mental disabilities.  The reasons I don't think this goal is worthwhile are threefold:  * I do not see it as being any different from calling someone blind, deaf, or lame. It is simply another disability that is used to exaggerate a situation. ""How did you not see that huge sign? Are you blind?"" Acceptable. ""How did you not hear that car horn blaring at you? Are you deaf?"" Acceptable. ""How did you get that answer wrong? Are you retarded?"" Unacceptable.   My theory for *why* this is the case is that people see mental retardation as more integral to who people are. If you imply that being blind is bad, that's ok, that's obvious and blind people are more than their disability; they are a person *with* a disability. If you imply that being mentally retarded is bad, you are directly insulting and belittling retarded people. I would argue that this mentality has the negative effect of us further stigmatizing mentally retarded individuals by forcing us to see the disability and the person as one in the same.   * People are not going to stop using this word. Oftentimes people compare this campaign with efforts to end the use of the word ""gay"" to casually describe something as being dumb. It is undeniable that mainstream use of that word has decreased in recent years, partially due to similar campaigns. However, the difference is that there is no inherent disadvantage to being gay; the only reason homosexuals are disadvantaged is because of society, and as society's opinions changed on gay persons, it made less sense to use that descriptor in a negative way. Retardation, on the other hand, is inherently disadvantageous and entails lower measures on intelligence tests and self-sufficiency, much like being blind or deaf are disadvantageous. While in the future we may see nearly no prejudice against gays, it will never seem weird to consider mental retardation as being disadvantageous and negative.  * The casual use of the word retarded came about due to its initial designation as a clinical descriptor for those with mental disabilities. Even if we were to somehow end the casual use of the word, it would simply be replaced by whatever the new clinical term is. As I stated, people will continue to draw a comparison to this disability, which is defined by lower intelligence, when describing things and actions that are defined by their lack of intelligence.  So there you have it. Hopefully you can change my view and help me see why we should be putting forth the time and effort to ""end the R-word."" Thanks, guys.  **TL;DR I do not think that ending the R-word is a worthwhile goal because it is no different from casually calling someone deaf or blind, people will continue to use this term because retardation is inherently a disadvantage, and even if the campaign works, people would just start using the new clinical term. Also, by making the rules different for retardation than deafness or blindness, it implies that retarded people *are* their disability instead of affected by it.

This conversation has given me a lot to think about, though.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason ”How did you get that answer wrong? Are you retarded?” is unacceptable is because not every answer a person with intellectual disabilities (the universally accepted description, for everyones information) is wrong. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes they give correct answers, and not just because of luck! The people I work with try especially hard to learn and be correct when giving input.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I know this was just an example, and you probably have many others in mind, but there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a difference between a blind person not being able to see (they can&amp;#39;t), and a ”retard” not being able to answer anything right (they sometimes can&amp;#39;t, just like you or I).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the record, the people I work with are apathetic to the ”r word”, in every sense. They are also aware that they have special needs, and would prefer if the public stop walking on eggshells trying to explain it in any other way. Does that mean you should go around palling around with the friendly retards at the YMCA like your best buds? Probably not :)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it is a worthwhile goal, but not a very practical one. Changing public lexicon is quite a stretch.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s a very simple reason why it &lt;em&gt;shouldn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; be used. It&amp;#39;s offensive to people who do have intellectual disabilities. I work with students like this, and they&amp;#39;ve been called the &amp;quot;r-word&amp;quot; their entire lives, and it brings up terrible memories of bullying and unequal treatment since as far back as they can remember. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While it may seem silly or unnecessary to us, it&amp;#39;s the equivalent of walking into a gay bar and calling someone a faggot.

I mean I can make my own drinks I do it all the time at home, but when I order a drink I just want to enjoy my drink. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, you have to think of the logistics of what you&amp;#39;re asking for. It works at your place because your place was designed for that type of service. At most any other restaurant it would only slow down service of food because instead of one person facilitating food and drinks for 8 tables or such it would be everyone at that table.

Not running around filling your drinks. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A major part of restaurants in western culture is the social aspect and this is why waiters exist.

CMV: Power doesn't corrupt people.,"All too commonly, we hear the saying ""absolute power corrupts absolutely."" I don't believe this to be true.  I don't believe that it is the power that corrupts people, but the fact that people themselves are corrupt to begin with, and that obtaining a position of power just offers them a medium through which to act on their corruption. I do believe that the majority of people are, in fact, corrupt. So assuming you take a random person and insert them into a position of power, it is likely that they will abuse the power that is granted to them. But, I also believe if you take a person who isn't corrupt, and insert them into this same position of power, they will not abuse the privileges and power of the position that is granted to them.  I think teachers illustrate this point very well, especially because it is much easier to become a teacher than say, the President of the United States. In this regard, you tend to have a larger sample size and have many more types of people to consider. In most cases, I would say that teachers tend to have absolute power over their classes, at least with regards to day-to-day activities. (Generally, if a teacher says to do something, it is expected that the student comply to the demand of the teacher. If the student disagrees, typically the matter is resolved at a later date with the intervention of a teacher's superior.)  Taking this assumption that teachers have absolute power over their students, you still tend to find a balance of teachers who abuse their power, and those who don't. If the saying that ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"" were true, all teachers would abuse their power, since it is the power that corrupts the person, and not the person that corrupts the power.  Parents work well for this example as well. Literally anybody can become a parent, as having a child is as easy as having sex. I would even say that parents definitely have absolute power over their children, even moreso than teachers. But even with parenting, you still tend to find a balance. Some parents are incredibly strict and unfair, dictating arbitrary rules for their children that they themselves may not follow, or rules that have no legitimate reason other than ""because I say so."" (I'm not arguing the fact that sometimes parents use the ""because I say so"" justification even if the rule does have a legitimate reason, but sometimes parents don't actually have a reason other than ""I say so."") However, you also find parents that are incredibly fair with their children. If a child does not agree with a rule set by a parent, and argues his or her case fairly, there are parents that would reconsider and change their rule for the sake of being fair. If ""absolute power corrupts absolutely,"" parents like the latter would not exist, as the power they hold over their child would corrupt them.  TL;DR: CMV: Absolute power does not corrupt absolutely; absolute corruption corrupts power absolutely.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true that there are good seeds and bad seeds in any grouping you can think of. People typically take actions based on incentives. The power itself doesn&amp;#39;t do anything, but in positions of power you generally have better opportunities. The better opportunities often involve pandering to another parties wants and needs. Lets say a company wants to pass a bill and needs people to advocate it. They&amp;#39;d likely reward an advocate that has some authority (like a doctor, senator) much more so than they would reward a random person on the street.

CMV: Actual Science doesn't start until you have a testable hypothesis.,"Edit: OK so I give. My view is probably more a matter of preserving my romantic notion of the pursuit of truth rather than the reality of having to learn from existing natural experiments either to generate more meaningful hypotheses or to have the rigorously gathered data needed to perform retrospective studies.  My friend and I had an argument about what is science. My initial position was that until you begin to formulate and test hypotheses what you are doing isn't science. For instance, coming up with ideas, being rigorous, and being an expert does not make you a scientist.   This is not to say that ideation, rigor, and expertise are not neccessary, just that you do not have science with without something to test and the means to test it.  As an aside, another concern I had was that we give credence to the creation of ideas without the process then you are labeling a process ""science,"" with its associated authority, when it should not have that authority. Ultimately, the value of science is in how it tests our understanding of the world so why should we allow ourselves to call the entirety of our research efforts science?  Apparently, I've offended people with this view in the past so please don't take this positon as an affront. I actually am leaning towards my view being incorrect, but I was hoping reddit might be interested in discussing the topic and also might remove this sense of ambivalence that I have about the matter. I have done the usual search for answers, but I haven't found a nice conclusion. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

There is a well established division within the &amp;#39;scientific&amp;#39; community between hypothesis driven and exploratory research, as a matter of fact. Apparently the latter half is just &amp;#39;support&amp;#39;, or something?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It seems like - on your definition - entire fields constituted of people who call themselves scientists, are not really science.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s suppose I spend 2 years working hard in the lab on a new project to characterise important factors for the motility of a parasite, in order to generate possible targets for drug discovery. I&amp;#39;ll describe the kind of thing that might involve. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So suppose I knocked out a panel of genes in my parasite and saw that one of the gene-knockout strains had abnormal/ablated motility when looked at in the microscope. Then I break open some normal parasite cells and isolate the protein, after which I check to see if anything else comes out along with it (any other proteins binding to it, for instance). I see from this that it does interact with some other proteins, so I find out the amino acid sequence of each one. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Using the amino acid sequences, I search a database of the parasite&amp;#39;s genome to see where the corresponding genes are - I find them there, and I use that knowledge to isolate the DNA of each gene from the parasite. Several of these genes were previously unknown. Not only that, but let&amp;#39;s imagine I realise one of the genes is a well studied protein already known to have important roles in parasite motility - as a &amp;#39;scientist&amp;#39;, my pulse would be racing at this point. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So anyway, I put each gene (including the original gene I knocked out) inside a strain of &lt;em&gt;E.coli&lt;/em&gt; so that I can make large amounts of protein for each on demand. I do that, then purify the proteins again in large quantities and I determine their crystal structures of each protein in a big interacting complex, from which I learn - just by looking - that &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; gene that I knocked out seems to play an important role in maintaining the structure of the already &amp;#39;famous&amp;#39; protein. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Elated, I submit my work to the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; and my groundbreaking investigation is lauded as one of the most important within the field for years. But you know what? I discovered several new genes, one of which is important to the parasite&amp;#39;s motility (and therefore infectivity), and discovered a key missing link in understanding the function of an already very well studied protein... didn&amp;#39;t do any science though, according to you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Neither did Rosalind Franklin, James Watson and Francis Crick do any science when they got the structure of DNA. Nor did the Human Genome Project when they found out so much about our own genetic make up. And actually, the whole disciplines of genomics, proteomics and transcriptomics? Not really science. Oh yeah - theoretical physics? Not science.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would put it that any definition of science as exclusive as yours doesn&amp;#39;t really capture what people mean by &amp;#39;science&amp;#39;, and for that reason should not be entertained.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;EDIT: DAMN, I just wrote all that and then realised you already had your mind changed. Frustration :P Anyway, there&amp;#39;s a nice story up there for you to read!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an &lt;a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S32/24/95A66/index.xml?section=topstories""&gt;article on &amp;quot;accelerated serendipity&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; that I think contradicts this. In chemistry, it is becoming trendy to combine large numbers of reactants together at once with no real goal in mind to try to discover new reactivity. The idea is that you are trying reactions you wouldn&amp;#39;t have thought of before because, frankly, based on what we know they are kind of silly. It&amp;#39;s a good way to &amp;quot;get lucky &amp;quot; and discover new reactions that might make something useful, like a common basic structure found in a useful drug.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no hypothesis. There is no basic premise or goal. There is just a roll of the dice... and sometimes you get lucky and find something cool. Then you make you hypothesis about how this reaction happened and you begin to test it.

"CMV: Saudi Arabia should be removed from the United Nations and stripped of all advantages that come with being part of the UN, due to their sexist governmental policies, harsh laws, and blatant human rights abuses","Not only does Saudi Arabia violate the basic rights of every human being, several of the rights they infringe on are in direct and gross violation of the [United Nations Human Rights Declaration](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/) set down by the United Nations after the atrocities of World War II. For specifics, the Saudi Arabian government violates:  * Article 3  &gt; Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.  If one observes the practices of the Sharia Law set forth in Saudi Arabia, it becomes clear that these are clearly not respected rights. For one, the women of Saudi Arabia are the subjects and objects of their husbands, having hardly any right to life, as they can be killed for vaguely defined reasons such as ""dishonouring the family"" or ""acting in a manner unbefitting of a woman"". Even in the case of the Princesses of Saudi Arabia, there is no distinction. They can be punished as easily and publicly as a servant, without consequences under the law. This also violates their right to security, as they have no guarantee that the government will protect them against any abuses. By extension, their right to liberty is violated, as once again, the male of a house holds immense amounts of legal power over the female. Several examples are found in this quote:  &gt;Under Saudi law, every adult female must have a male relative as her ""guardian"", whose permission she is required to have in order to travel, study, or work.  Because of the bastardized version of Islam many of the powerful men of Saudi Arabia choose to follow, they interpret many things from their religious texts, including that women are the source of all evil, that they should not be allowed to study or work, and that if they do they will negatively affect everyone around them. Due to this, the right to liberty in Saudi Arabia for Saudi woman is not only de facto non-existant but also de jure non-existant. The Mutawa of Saudi Arabia are very powerful as they serve as the religious police. They are so powerful that they have the power to prosecute a member of the Saudi Royal Family, which, to my knowledge, has never been done. The point is that they serve as a very powerful force in the oppression of  women in Saudi Arabia, and given the power of Sharia Law over the Saudis, they easily cast shadows on the liberty of all the women of Saudi Arabia.  * Article 5  &gt;No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  This is probably the most infringed on right in the Kingdom. The punishments under the Law in Saudi Arabia include, but are not limited to, lashes, stoning, drowning, death by firing squad, death by crucifixion, death by beheading, with the option of public punishments, just as one would offer with a spectator sport. If Saudi Arabia allowed as much choice in the living of live as they did in the ending of life, they would be much better off.  Out of these items, three stand out. Cruxifiction, stoning, and beheading are all barbaric and extremely cruel ways of punishment. In the case of beheading, during the process, I can only imagine that the subject would experience immense pain as the executioner proceeded to cut through his throat, then the thick muscles of his neck, and then all the way through the spinal cord. There is no debate that this is a violation of Article 5. Cruxifiction , for those who don't know, means that you would be nailed to a plank of wood or some such surface to bleed out, or more likely, die of starvation or stoning while nailed to the wall like an animal skin. I'm not even going to bother explaining why that infringes son Article 5. Lastly, stoning. Since when has having stones hurled at you a normal punishment? Not only is it extremely degrading, it is also extremely cruel, and extremely stupid. I think I've said enough on this topic.  * Article 7  &gt;All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.  Women are not equal before the law. I mentioned it above under Article 3, but once again, it is blatantly clear that women are not treated as equals under the law. Not only are they completely unrepresented in the Saudi Arabian government, even the Royal women have barely any power. With a court system, law enforcement system, army, and executive system all run by men, I would find it very hard to believe that they are given equal protection or treatment under the law. The simple fact that it is completely legal for a man to kill his wife with ""proper reason"" is evidence enough for this point.  * Article 9  &gt;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.  I'm not even going to bother to explain this one myself, and I will instead leave you with [this](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30744693?ocid=socialflow_twitter), [this](http://www.arabianbusiness.com/saudi-arabia-executes-54-people-in-first-3-months-of-2015-588431.html), and [this](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/siti-zainab-saudi-arabia-beheads-mentally-ill-female-domestic-worker-angering-indonesia-1496492).  * Article 10  &gt;Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.  I'm losing steam writing about this, so I'll leave you with a few quotes to prove my point:  &gt;Western-based human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have criticized the activities of both the Mabahith and the Mutawa, as well as a number of other aspects of human rights in Saudi Arabia. These include the number of executions, the range of offenses which are subject to the death penalty, the lack of safeguards for the accused in the criminal justice system, the treatment of homosexuals, the use of torture, the lack of religious freedom, and the highly disadvantaged position of women. The Albert Shanker Institute and Freedom House have also reported that ""Saudi Arabia's practices diverge from the concept of the rule of law.""  &gt;Courts in Saudi Arabia observe few formalities and the country's first criminal procedure code, issued in 2001, has been largely ignored. Decisions are made without juries and usually by a single judge.  * Article 13  &gt;(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state. (2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.  Saudi woman require permission from the head of the house (husband, father, or male relative) to leave the country. They can be sequestered in their own homes and forbidden from leaving, returning, or any number of things that would restrict their movement. I quoted this above, but it is also relevant here:  &gt;Under Saudi law, every adult female must have a male relative as her ""guardian"", whose permission she is required to have in order to travel, study, or work.  * Article 16  &gt;(1) Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. (2) Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses. (3) The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.  Every single god damn right in Article 13 is utterly non-existant for the women of Saudi Arabia. They do NOT have equal rights during marriage, as a women has to go through the highly biased court systems to achieve a divorce whereas a man need only say, ""On this day I have divorced you."" They certainly do not marry with consent, teenage girls often marrying 55 or 60 year old men, maybe even older than their own father. And if you think that the family is protected under the law, from, say, a father threatening to execute his daughter for ""indecency"", then I advise you look into exactly how that doesn't happen.  * Article 18  &gt;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.  Saudi Arabia has a de jure restriction on the right of freedom of religion, as the only allowed religion is Sunni Islam, and Sunni Islam alone. No other denominations of Islam or ANY OTHER RELIGION are allowed to be practiced. Anyone marrying a Saudi citizen or attempting to be a Saudi national MUST convert to Islam, with no exceptions.   * Article 19  &gt;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.  Censoring of the media, of the press, and of the basic expression of thought through speech are all restricted heavily in Saudi Arabia. No further explanation is needed, simply look at the first article linked above under Article 9.  * Article 20  &gt;(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. (2) No one may be compelled to belong to an association.  The second point above is infringed on; by being forced to convert to Islam, you are also being forced to join the mosque and participate in practices such as praying at the specified times and observing religious customs as part of the mosque...unless you're a woman, in which case I don't believe that you are allowed in a mosque. But I may be wrong about this.  * Article 21  &gt;(1) Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives. (2) Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country. (3) The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.  They are a monarchy and a theocracy, breaking point three of Article 21. Women are allowed no representation in the government, breaking point one in Article 21. I don't believe there is a such thing as public service in Saudi Arabia, so point two can be entirely disregarded in this case.  * Article 23  &gt;(1) Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment. (2) Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work. (3) Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection. (4) Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.  Women DO NOT have the inherent right to work, nor the right to even have an education so that they might one day work. In the case of equal pay, women simply not being allowed to work takes care of that issue right there. Point three of Article 23 can be entirely ignored under these circumstances, and point 4 is entirely untrue in Saudi Arabia, as I doubt the poor laborers have ever heard of the word ""union"" used in that context.  * Article 26  &gt;(1) Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit. (2) Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. (3) Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.  WOMEN DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION. Again and again this will surface. Women are extremely restricted in all manner of ways, violating their basic rights as human beings. Furthermore, the one-sided Islamic based education that people are allowed to go through in Saudi Arabia is little more than indoctrination of the falsifications that have plagued the bastardized version of Islam all too many people think is the true interpretation of the religion!  Finally, I have finished cataloging all of their violations of ONLY the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This was **established by the UN itself** and is being **broken by one of it's main members**. If this isn't grounds for removal, I don't know what is.  I know Saudi Arabia is a large economic player, is one of the founding members of several Arab confederates and alliances, as well as a major player in OPEC, but by sending our (United States) President to that country, allowing them to serve in the United Nations, an organization committed to stopping violence and promoting fairness and equality, and maintaining an allied relationship with them is not only hypocritical, it is morally wrong. I don't see how one could argue that they shouldn't be removed from the United Nations, nor can I see how one could justify ANY of the actions or laws listed above.  If you want to change my mind, I'd be open to listening to the economic, geo-political, and military perspectives of this argument, but if you insist on arguing morality here, I'm open to hearing it.

The gov&amp;#39;t does not actually use these extreme punishments  on the population. However, the laws are there to appease the extremist factions.  The gov&amp;#39;t in control right now is actually pretty moderate, but they can&amp;#39;t let the extremists know that, so the moderates let those laws stay on the books. It&amp;#39;s one way the balance of peace is maintained. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just because it doesn&amp;#39;t meet your preconceived notion of peace does not mean it&amp;#39;s bad. Their notion of peace is very different, than say, America&amp;#39;s. The Middle East has been under stress for quite a few decades now. Any minute step towards peace matters, no matter how small. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a big difference between laws being on the books, and laws actually being used. There are many laws in the US that are just not enforced either, or just occasionally enforced. One being, in Michigan, it is illegal to swear in front of women and children. Last time it was enforced was in the 1990s, and that was a one time thing when a man was probably verbally abusing his wife and kids in front of an off-duty cop. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;#39;s see the times when the actual Saudi gov&amp;#39;t has used these punishments, instead of some extremist faction. Getting your information from Fox News is not the same as living there. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who has lived in Saudi Arabia, I can tell you that you&amp;#39;re being very hyperbolic about the situation for women in Saudi Arabia, and in some cases just plain wrong. Women can (and do) both work and receive an education in Saudi Arabia. The largest university for women in the world, Princess Nora University is in Saudi Arabia. Its so big it even has its own metro system. There are over 50,000 Saudi women studying at the university and can study everything from English to interior design. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You also have to remember that Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy. It isn&amp;#39;t a democracy, so things like elections and the right to vote aren&amp;#39;t exactly applicable. A few years ago the government did allow for what are basically local municipal elections, and first said men and women could vote but then said only men could vote. The King did announce after the election that women will be able to vote in the next election. The mutawwa also hassle men just as much as they do women (if not more) I certainly has my run ins with the mutawwa while I was there.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to meet several Saudi women, and all of them have basically been the opposite of the stereotypical &amp;quot;oppressed Muslim woman.&amp;quot; I met Saudi women who had recieved PhDs from American universities, Saudi women who were doctors, and even housewives. Saudi women tend to have very big personalities and are particularly apt at managing familial politics and expectations. Saudis are VERY VERY family oriented people. Everything comes back to their family. In addition, you have to realize that many Saudi women are more or less fine with their situation, or at least don&amp;#39;t think of it as some sort of huge human rights violation. What Saudi women do worry about are things like the economy, security, opportunities for their children, etc., they&amp;#39;re just like women all over the world. In addition women tend to be more conservative than men. One female doctor I met had studied and lived in the US for a while but decided to come back to Saudi because she said she felt more comfortable and safe in Saudi. Many women actually support the things we think of as being &amp;quot;oppressive.&amp;quot; Basically people living outside Saudi Arabia don&amp;#39;t truly understand the situation for women in Saudi Arabia and don&amp;#39;t know Saudi women&amp;#39;s actual views or desires. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now of course, I&amp;#39;m not going to say the situation for Saudi women is equal or that they have complete freedom or anything like that, but the truth of the matter is that women all over the world face certain inequalities and restrictions. Women&amp;#39;s inequality is certainly not only restricted to Saudi Arabia; its a world-wide problem. Nor are things like human rights violations. Plenty of countries are committing gross human rights violations. If we start kicking countries out of the UN for women&amp;#39;s inequality and human rights violations, we will be kicking out more than just Saudi Arabia; we&amp;#39;ll be kicking out the US, Russia, China, etc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"CMV: When people intentionally engage in risky activities outside of work, like climbing Mount Everest, it shouldn't be considered a tragedy if they are killed in the process.","When a sane and sober adult decides to take up a clearly risky hobby, he or she knows going in that it may not end well. Whether it's hangliding, skydiving, rock climbing, or car racing, the participant is choosing to put his or her life at risk for the sake of adventure. If the participant has children, it's an even more questionable decision. In any event, if he or she is killed in the act, there should be no sympathy for him or her. Our sympathy should be reserved for those who die as a result of unavoidable tragedies, such as a rare form of cancer or a head-on collision with a wrong-way, drunk driver. If someone's job is dangerous, sympathy is warranted if something goes wrong. After all, he or she was simply trying to earn a living. On the other hand, if someone dies while partaking in a dangerous hobby, the logical response is, ""Yes, that was a risky decision.""","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every single thing that we do has risk associated with it.  With respect to your examples, getting into a head on collision with a drunk driver is bad, this is true, but you accepted the risk of other drivers when you chose to drive, therefore you engaged in a risky proposition (driving) and were unlucky enough to encounter a bad situation (drunk driver).  Cancer is thought to be due to a combination of genetics and environmental factors, so even rare forms of cancer have to do with you participating in modern society with its associated carcinogens in the air we breathe, the foods we eat and the liquids we drink.  Granted the chance of any of these things is lower than when you engage in things such as diving, sky diving etc, but its more of an issue of the likelihood of something happening, not that driving, or living in a city is completely devoid of risk.  I am not egotistical enough to say what is an appropriate level of risk for people to engage in or not engage in, so why not mourn the loss of life and leave it at that without pointing fingers and saying its your own fault?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;With regards to a dangerous hobby, the legal principle of &amp;#39;volenti non fit injuria&amp;#39; applies: &amp;#39;To he who consents, no harm is done&amp;#39;.  However, as in most things, there is more to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I fail to see the connection between tragedy and sympathy. Sympathy (&lt;em&gt;syn&lt;/em&gt; - together, &lt;em&gt;pathos&lt;/em&gt; - feeling) is a reaction to the distress or need of another human being. If the person is dead, how can they have a need or be in distress? In these cases I would argue that what is meant by the term &amp;#39;sympathy&amp;#39; in these cases is feeling of pity for the family and friends of the deceased, as opposed to the deceased themselves, which is something independent of the cause of the death. In this way, any death invokes a sympathetic response for those who were closed to the person.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With regards to the term tragedy, this is when the misfortune of one person invokes a catharsis in those observing, particularly a cleansing of pity and fear. I don&amp;#39;t see this being strictly relevant in the case of a thrill-seeker meeting their maker unexpectedly, but this may be due to the public inaccurate use of language.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You mention when someone takes up a clearly risky hobby. In many cases all we know is that a &lt;em&gt;hazard&lt;/em&gt; exists, but this is not necessarily a &lt;em&gt;risk&lt;/em&gt; as we do not always know the most likely (or maximal) outcome, or how likely these outcomes are. People attempt to estimate the risk, however we are famously bad at this. Once we have made an estimate, we will do one or more of the four:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Avoid the risk altogether: we feel that the risk is too high, and it should not be embarked on. This is my position with most risky hobbies, but not everyone feels the same way;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reduce the risk: some will undergo training, buy better equipment, research the activity etc. They recognise that the risk is high, so they attempt to reduce the possible outcome, the likelihood of occurrence, or both;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Transfer the risk: usually through insurance, people try to make the impact lower by transferring the liability to another body. Doesn&amp;#39;t help if you are dead, however, unless you take out an on-death policy before the activity, which is highly suspicious!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Accept the risk: usually after attempting to reduce it, the person feels the risk is now low enough to accept.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This last point is where problems creep in. Did the person have all the data, statistics, and knowledge before they accepted the risk? Often we &amp;#39;accept without knowledge&amp;#39;, accepting a risk that is above what is reasonable as they do not have a proper feel for what the risk is. In this case &amp;#39;volenti non fit injuria&amp;#39; does not apply: this principle requires a full knowledge and extent of the risk. I feel sympathy for a person injured in an accident when undertaking a risky hobby (not when they are killed: then I sympathise with the family, as mentioned above), but like you I feel less pity/sympathy for someone who has been injured/killed where the risk was fully known and quantified, and the extent known... and then they did it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With regards to your final point about employment, I agree wholeheartedly, and in UK case law the principle of &amp;#39;volenti non fit injuria&amp;#39; is often not applicable in these cases, as even though the person knows that the risk is part of the job, they often cannot fully consent to the level, and certainly do not consent to harm as part of a breach or failure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
Ideology has no historical explanatory power. All of history can be explained in terms of narrow self-interest. CMV.,"Let me first clarify what I mean by ""self-interest"". I don't mean the tautologically true sense of ""Anything you want to do is in your self-interest because you gain pleasure by doing it."" What I mean is:  1. Maximizing one's material wealth and comfort 2. Doing likewise for one's kin, according to [Hamilton's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection#Hamilton.27s_rule)  My claim is that the course of history can be explained entirely in terms of these two behaviors. Contrary behavior, such as altruistic concern for the well-being of others in general, is so rare as to be historically ineffective.  Let me give a few examples of the types of explanations that I believe can be found for any historical phenomenon.  Question: Why has the right to vote expanded to more and more people over the last few centuries?  * Wrong answer: Enlightenment philosophies persuaded people that it didn't make sense to discriminate between people based on accidental characteristics. Over time, the sphere of humanity has expanded. * Right answer: Because wars are costly, whenever there's a dispute, it makes sense simply to count up the total number of potential soldiers on each side, and determine the larger side to be the victor. With the invention of guns, the military was no longer restricted to the elite; as technology advanced, more and more people could contribute to the hypothetical war effort, including poorer men and women.  Question: Why did the American South retain slavery for longer than the North, until the Civil War forced them to abolish it?  * Wrong answer: The North was more morally advanced than the South. * Right answer: Slavery was not profitable in the North's industrialized, skilled-labor-based economy, as it was in the South's agrarian economy.  So, to change my view: **Can you provide an example of a historical event or phenomenon that cannot be explained purely in terms of self-interest?**","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because wars are costly, whenever there&amp;#39;s a dispute, it makes sense simply to count up the total number of potential soldiers on each side, and determine the larger side to be the victor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lightweight though it is, this could be argued to be an ideology. The thing that strikes me about it is it&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; self-interest, it&amp;#39;s a risk trade-off. If those in the underclass &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; go to war, then the reigning class maximizes material wealth and comfort for their kin. (Not to mention, a physical war between men and women would, let&amp;#39;s be honest, everybody would be losers, but especially women, considering the last famous female general was probably Joan of Arc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/what-motivates-suicide-bombers-0""&gt;http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/what-motivates-suicide-bombers-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They found in a study of suicide bombers that ideology and altruism was one of the most common reasons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another common reason was that suicide bombers were esteemed in their culture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;the driving force is not religion but a cocktail of motivations including politics, humiliation, revenge, retaliation and altruism.

"CMV: Football is an institution which causes more problems than it solves, and receives far more money than it deserves.","First disclaimer: I don't like football; I've never seen the appeal of men kicking a ball around a field while lots of people scream. I'm putting this here so my biases on the issue are clear.   Second disclaimer: as a Brit, I'm focusing on English football, not handegg. References to the latter are fine where relevant.   I don't think football provides any external benefit to society - by which I mean, it doesn't actually help anyone outside of the football industry. All I see, when I see football supporters, is people trying to assert their dominance over other people by reinforcing the status of ""their"" team, or putting down the other team. This is usually light-hearted in uni circles, but I know this gets a lot worse.   The 100 hour war, between Honduras and El Salvador, was triggered by a football game. Granted, the game itself was a small block removed from an already very unstable Jenga tower, but it seems to me that all football does it bring out the tribalistic, irrational animal in people that allows the 100 hour war and the Hillsborough disaster to happen. I can't see it as a tool for peace or friendship or discourse or understanding; all I see is anger, rivalry, shouting. It reinforces the same sort of in-group-out-group ""You belong to a different tribe therefore you are bad"" mentality that leads to xenophobia, and from there, racism and overzealous nationalism (read: UKIP.) This sort of mentality is something we need to keep a lid on, I believe, if we want to have a more peaceful society.   I'm aware, though, that there's likely a lot I'm not taking into consideration, and that my strong dislike for football has coloured my views no small amount. I'd like to gain a rounder perspective on the issue, so please CMV.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My dad always joked about how the very rabid football fans among us are channelling an otherwise destructive warlust into a relatively harmless game. Hence the nationalistic fervour, among other things. Of course, that doesn&amp;#39;t account for the acts of violence and war committed in the name of football, as you wisely point out. But all in all, do you think it&amp;#39;s possible that football does not so much encourage violent, nationalist urges as it does provide them a (pun intended) safe playing field? If we cannot fully &amp;quot;keep a lid&amp;quot; on this mentality, as you say, perhaps the best thing we can do is try to encourage it&amp;#39;s expression in sport and not war. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the interests of full disclosure, I&amp;#39;m not a football fan. I think the game is beautiful and the athletes admirable; I always enjoy the odd match. That being said, I couldn&amp;#39;t tell you anything about sides, players, stats, etc. So in this thread, I&amp;#39;m on both sides of the fence. I think your point is quite valid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like football either, but any problems related to it, are not caused by the game itself. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter what activity it is, anything from football to chess can be corrupted.

CMV: I think that bringing up rights when discussing policy is unproductive.,"I'm not a fan of the way policy discussion takes place and feel it could be more productive.  Let us start off with abortion. I am completely pro choice but I don't like the way discussion in some cases takes place. For example, I saw a post on two x that didn't really refute any restrictive abortion policies but just stated the right to bodily autonomy as an argument against them. I don't feel like stating that is a proper refutation. I think that if we were to look at something like sex selective abortion policies it might be more obvious what I see is wrong with those arguments. Imagine if they were having a debate in India. One person brings up all this data about the problems with unrestricted sex selective abortion and the other person simply said that those policies shouldn't be allowed because it was their right to an abortion for whatever reason they wish. This would be bad because the discussion is far too nuanced.  I think that there are problems that arise from hiding behind this argument. The fundamental reason I would consider it bad is this. Rights are a human construct. A bunch of people got together and decided that guaranteeing certain rights would be best for the people. It seems perfectly reasonable that they could've been wrong and that guaranteeing those rights in certain situation are bad. Not trying to suggest whether or not they are. They could be though so arguing that something shouldn't happen because it is your right is a terrible argument.  I'm not trying to suggest all discussion that takes place is like this. When talking about gun rights there is a lot of fruitful and important discussion using data, statistics, and other relevant factors. However, there is a small group of arguers who would refute arguments from the other side by simply saying that it is their right guaranteed by the second amendment.  I think that rights are not relevant in policy discussion.  Edit: My view has been changed thanks to iamblegion. I appreciate everyone who commented to assist in changing my view. It definitely did feel off.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rights are an excellent way to frame a discussion.  There are a lot of policies that we can still fruitfully discuss while still respecting the rights involved.  Take your abortion example.  There is a problem that we think needs a solution (sex selective abortion).  In discussing possible solutions to this problem, rights are an important consideration.  They aren&amp;#39;t the end of the discussion, but they do provide some useful limits to what we can consider a good policy.  A policy that simply bans abortions of female fetuses isn&amp;#39;t good, because it clearly tramples on the right to bodily autonomy.  A solution that, for example, gives a monetary incentive for expectant mothers of girls to carry those pregnancies is better, because it attempts to solve the problem while maintaining the mother&amp;#39;s choice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The bringing up of rights in this context doesn&amp;#39;t end the discussion, it merely gives a good guide of what sort of policies should be discussed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If rights are irrelevant, there is no need for laws. At their base, laws protect rights via threat of physical punishment. Murder, for instance, is illegal because you have a right to life. Statistics and facts do have an important place in policy, but to temper rights. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at abortion, how do you justify abortion using only statistics and facts?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: Employers shouldn't pay for employees vacation time or sick days; if you're not at the jobsite working you shouldn't get paid,"Employees are paid to work, they are paid to get a job done, what happens outside of the workplace is no concern of the employer and the employer should have no relationship to the livlihood of the other person outside of their job. If they are not doing their job why should they be getting paid? Why should they pay someone to hang out on a beach when there are people willing to work for the same pay with no vacation days? Why should the government 'force' employers to pay for their employees to sit on a beach, contributing nothing to the company, when there are people willing to do the job with no vacation or sick leave?  Edit: I'm thinking mainly about unskilled labor here where there is a surplus of workers who could be up and running within a day to a week.

I believe that homosexuality and Christianity are incompatible. CMV.,"I believe that homosexuality and Christianity are incompatible. That is, identifying as both a homosexual and a Christian is unjustifiable. It is evident that the bible takes an anti-homosexual stance. I am working under the assumption that all brands of Christianity accept every word written in the bible; otherwise, it seems that this would not be true Christianity.  It may be worth noting that I do not identify as either homosexual or Christian. I am posting this with hope that others can provide insight into my belief. Thank you.  Edit: for clarification, I meant that being a true Christian (who does not intentionally break the laws of Christianity) and being homosexual is not a logical position.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems like you have a tenuous grasp of Christianity as practiced by actual Christians. Here are my objections over your post:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christians who are against homosexuality don&amp;#39;t hate homosexuals per se; they hate homosexual acts (ie hate the sin, no the sinner). Even among rabid homophobic sects and denominations, celibate/virgin homosexuals are often compared with kleptomaniacs who resist the urge to steal. In other words, they are lauded for resisting their ungodly urges. So already, a homosexual Christian isn&amp;#39;t incompatible. They just have to be celibate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a more theological level, everyone is supposed to be have sinned in the eyes of God. Everyone falls short in the eyes of God. And depending on the denomination, the &amp;quot;everyone falling short&amp;quot; part technically condemns everyone to hell. You&amp;#39;re going to Hell for being gay, and you&amp;#39;re going to Hell for being an asshole to people, and you&amp;#39;re going to Hell for drinking too much, etc. That&amp;#39;s basically the whole point of Jesus&amp;#39;s crucifixion as espoused by Christians. His death is supposed to wash away the presence of sin or otherwise give Christian a fighting chance to enter Heaven. This is also why evangelicalism is a huge deal for Christians because the whole &amp;quot;Jesus washing away your Hell damning sins&amp;quot; only works if you actually believe in Jesus. Homosexual acts would just be another form of sin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your edit of &amp;quot;the laws of Christianity&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t really make sense. There isn&amp;#39;t a agreed upon &amp;quot;law of Christianity.&amp;quot; Christians don&amp;#39;t agree with the version of Bible to use (KJV vs NIV). Depending on the denomination, there&amp;#39;s sections of the Bible that gets replaced (The Catholic Bible has sections that&amp;#39;s not found in the Protestant Bible and vice versa). And what about Mormons? They use the Old Testament and New Testament like most Christian denominations, but they also use an additional book called the Book of Mormon. So, does that mean they aren&amp;#39;t Christian because they use an additional book?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another objection I have with your post is that religion isn&amp;#39;t just &amp;quot;stuff that we have to follow because it&amp;#39;s written in this holy book.&amp;quot; This is a fair point to mistaken as Protestants tend to focus on the Bible over other things like tradition, and most American Christians are Protestants, which means most American non-Christians are mostly exposed to Protestant Christianity (I&amp;#39;m assuming you&amp;#39;re American). But this isn&amp;#39;t necessarily true for all Christian denominations. Catholics stress tradition as well as the Bible. That&amp;#39;s why Catholics have all these holidays celebrating saints and why Catholics venerate saints even though saints aren&amp;#39;t referenced in the Bible at all. Religion exists among illiterate tribes of people, so a canon isn&amp;#39;t a necessary condition for a religion. So, what are the traditions of the various Christian denominations? Well, that depends on the denomination. And not all of them will condemn homosexuals (Quakers, Presbyterians, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s possible to be a true Christian if that means not breaking the laws of Christianity. The whole point of Christianity is that no one is able to fulfil the law, because we&amp;#39;re all sinful. But it doesn&amp;#39;t matter in terms of a Christian&amp;#39;s salvation; Jesus died to take the punishment for sin so any person who repents and believes in that is saved, and thus sinless in God&amp;#39;s eyes. Sure, Christians try not to sin because sin is against God&amp;#39;s will and God knows what&amp;#39;s best for us, and we want to please him, but at the end of the day all Christians sin because Christians are human.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sin is not incompatible with Christianity, it&amp;#39;s why we need it. Homosexual acts are a sin according to the Bible, but no more so than any other sin, and Christians are &lt;a href=""http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%207:1-3&amp;amp;version=NIV""&gt;told not to judge others for being a worse sinner that themselves.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the issue with being a Christian and a homosexual isn&amp;#39;t that it&amp;#39;s a sin, it&amp;#39;s that it&amp;#39;s a conscious sin. To be a Christian and be in a homosexual relationship is to wake up every morning and decide to sin that day by continuing that relationship, rather than accidentally find yourself lying or bitching or whatever, it&amp;#39;s premeditated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s not my place, or your place to judge. Christianity, and any religion is about an individual&amp;#39;s relationship with their God. If you&amp;#39;re a homosexual Christian and are happy with that decision and feel God is too, then I&amp;#39;m in no place to say anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Am a Christian, not homosexual but going through a similar issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV:People of mixed race shouldn't be referred to by only half/part of their race.,"A few people to consider.  Barack Obama-Half Kenyan/ Half Caucasian. Known socially as:Black.  Tiger Woods:Black, Asian, Indian, Caucasian. Known socially as:Black.  ~~Mitt Romney-European and Latino ancestry. Known socially as:White.~~  George Zimmerman-Half hispanic/ Half white. Known socially as:White.  Each of these people brings up an interesting side of biracial perceptions. It used to be that any race mixed with caucasian would automatically be cancelled out. Obama is half black, half white, but people call him black, Tiger Woods is an amalgamation of racs and people call him black.   However in recent years, these social rules seemed to change somewhat with racially charged cases like Zimmerman being referred to as white, despite having a ""darker"" race of peruvian ancestry from his mother's side. ~~Romney himself does not acknowledge as latino, even though George Romney was from Mexico, defaulting to white to appeal to his base.~~   What is the point of all of this? It's that our terminology for classifying people seems to be outdated as more and more biracial people have come into American life and we need to rethink the logic behind it.  Some might say that it's wrong to label people, but identity is important. Obama has written about how he struggled to decide whether he was white or black as a youth, a society that could barely understand the idea of mixed race forced him to choose between one side of his ancestry or the other, when he should have accepted both.   Tiger Woods calls himself ""Cablinasian"" or ""Multicultural."", which gives a fair homage to all sides of his family. Referring to someone who is biracial by only one of their races ultimately discredits one or more people who played a part in that person being alive. Whether it is done socially, ~~or whether it is done voluntarily like with Romney (which is still brought by social pressures.)~~, I think that this approach of categorization is fundementally wrong and illogical because it ultimately makes a person deny a big part of themselves and their family.   Instead of referring to someone of mixed race as one race, there should be new terms invented to better suit who they are. Wood's approach with ""Cablinasian"" and other variations such as ""Eurasian"" or simply ""Multicultural"" being accepted into mainstream culture would be of a great benefit and a welcome addition to the lexicon for a society becoming more and more multicultural by the day.  That's my stance, please change my view.  EDIT:Removed Romney.  EDIT #2:Been asleep for a while, so sorry I stopped responding. The feedback to my view has been pretty civil considering the subject, so I'm very happy about that.

Multicultural is not a culture in itself so it makes it difficult to personally identify with the term as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It would also be somewhat disingenuous to use it at least in cases like mine. I was raised predominately by my white mother, and only visited my father states away during the summers when I was in grade school. He didn&amp;#39;t have a large hand in raising me and I&amp;#39;m fairly alien to Latino culture, and know more Japanese than I do Spanish, which is not a lot. I know very well what Latino culture is, having grown up in Texas in a predominately Mexican neighborhood but I don&amp;#39;t feel I am part of it. Therefore it would be erroneous to call me multicultural.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When people outright ask, I tell them I&amp;#39;m mixed and let them know with what races, and if they&amp;#39;re really interested then I let them know which I identify more with.

I believe people who commit suicide are coward and selfish CMV,"They have so much help around them with family and friends, the suicide hotline, multiple therapy centers where they can talk one on one and so much other help.

Many people do not have, or cannot get, access to help. Their families and friends often aren&amp;#39;t supportive, especially not in the way they need to be. Most people are unable to relate to the depressed, so they ask, &amp;#39;Why don&amp;#39;t you just feel happy today?&amp;#39; This is no more logical or productive than asking why someone with cancer doesn&amp;#39;t just wish it away. &amp;#39;Treatment&amp;#39; is not guaranteed even with those who have access to the best services and most supportive families. Psychological therapy techniques are imperfect, and even mild results can take months to show themselves. Medication for depression isn&amp;#39;t like painkillers - you don&amp;#39;t pop a pill and then within an hour you&amp;#39;re feeling much better. Trying one pill can take months to see if there are any results. Most people have to try multiple medications to achieve even some relief - so we&amp;#39;re talking on a scale of years. These medications often have rather nasty and common side-effects, and their effects aren&amp;#39;t well understood. Many people try various medications and only get worse. And, through all of these, the suffering of depression remains. Happiness is no longer a goal - the person just wants the pain, the guilt and the numbness to go away. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The comparison to jumping out of a burning building are suitable. I have been suicidal in the past, and though I wanted to exist in a state of pure nothingness - to be &lt;em&gt;dead,&lt;/em&gt; I did not want to go through the process of &lt;em&gt;dying.&lt;/em&gt; Contrary to your perception, committing suicide requires &lt;em&gt;bravery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s another important point of this, and this is something I don&amp;#39;t believe anyone&amp;#39;s brought up yet. Committing suicide is often a &lt;em&gt;selfless&lt;/em&gt; act, and I mean that in the truest sense of the word. Many depressed people commit suicide not because of the despair and anguish they feel, but because they are being a burden on others. They see themselves as not having worth, and that certainly means not worth the time and resources others put into them. So why not commit suicide since it would help them? This is a belief they may very well hold despite being explicitly told, numerously, otherwise. Remember that depression is not rational.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And even if that&amp;#39;s not the case, I would still argue that suicide is not a selfish act - not in the negative connotation you have framed it in. Why should someone be subject to years of mental torture just so others can feel fine? Suicide should always be about the person who is suffering - it&amp;#39;s prevention should be because it may be possible for them to go on to live a happier life. And, if it&amp;#39;s demonstrated that they can&amp;#39;t, suicide should be an option for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person is so depressed that they want to die, they have come to the point that they no longer fear death. They&amp;#39;ve exhausted all options. Emotions are difficult to come by. They feel numb most of the time-- eating becomes difficult, sleeping is difficult, communicating, smiling, enjoying things, etc. They are no longer a person. And the problem with this is that depression is a mental illness that does not cease. It&amp;#39;s a struggle that they&amp;#39;ll deal with for the entirety of their lifetime. There is a malfunction in their brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They did not choose this. Life was an unfair burden that they were brought into. They are constantly suffering. 24/7, everyday, pure, insurmountable dread. They are only living for other people. They&amp;#39;re continuing only to make other&amp;#39;s happy, forever. They never had a choice, and they never will, for their entire lives. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To ask a person with this disease to live for your own pleasure, when they have no will to, to me, is what&amp;#39;s selfish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
Yahweh is no more benevolent than Cthulhu or Khorne. CMV.,"&gt;I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and mine sword shall devour flesh.   Deuteronomy 32:42  Reading the Bible, it seems that Yahweh, the Jewish/Christian/Muslim god, really likes killing people, especially infidels. For example:  * Yahweh kills Onan for pulling out. (Gen 38:10) * Yahweh kills all the firstborn Egyptian children to prove a point to a Pharaoh who he hardened the heart of. (Ex 12:29) * Yahweh forces his believers to kill their family and friends. (Ex 32:27-28) * Yahweh kills 14,700 people for complaining about his killings. (Num 16:49) * Yahweh sends serpents to bite people for complaining about lack of food and water. (Num 21:6) * Yahweh sends an evil spirit to cause 1000 people to burn to death. (Jg 9:23-27) * Yahweh accepts a human sacrifice. (Jg 11:39) * Yahweh orders a genocide of the Amalekites. (1 Sam 15:2-3) * Yahweh kills Saul, his seven sons, and all their soldiers for not killing all of the Amalekites. (1 Sam 31:2) * Yahweh slowly kills a baby to punish David for adultery (1 Sam 12:14-18) * Yahweh sends bears to kill 42 boys for making fun of Elisha's bald head. (2 Kg 2:23-24) * Yahweh blesses Judith above all women for cutting off a sleeping man's head. (Judith 13:6-10)  There are many more examples of malicious, petty killings by Yahweh, but I believe this is enough for you to get where I'm coming from.   How is this any different than ""Blood for the Blood God!"" (I'm making comparisons with fictional deities because no other gods that are actually being worshipped seem quite as bloodthirsty)? And how can Yahweh claim to be omnibenevolent after such obvious malevolence?  EDIT: I will no longer respond to any posts which do not directly reference Cthulhu or Khorne. And my view has already been changed on Cthulhu.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

CMV: I don't see the big deal about poetry.,"I don't understand the importance of the subculture of poetry: readings/contests, memorizing it, and praising it.  Most of it is repetitive: hardship and love.   If you want something philosophical, I feel you should stick to essays.  If you want something artistic, I feel you should stick to art and other craft.   I feel poetry fails to combine these two elements diversely, and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship. Yes, there are very nice and interesting poems that don't fall in between these two spectra, but they are not as well-known or as praised.   I have read some good poems, and I do have a few I like, but I don't see the big deal about it. For instance, why do Russians rely heavily in poetry and teaching their kids to memorize them. What about poetry is so respected?   Edit: I got some really really wonderful and great responses here, and I thank you for the plentiful suggestions.

While it&amp;#39;s rare that an entire form can be lost on a person, it&amp;#39;s not impossible. If poetry doesn&amp;#39;t do these things for you, then by all means, don&amp;#39;t place a high level of importance on it in your life. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m largely in the same place. There&amp;#39;s a few poems I like, I&amp;#39;d consider myself a &amp;quot;fan&amp;quot; of Yeats, but it&amp;#39;s really not my thing. When I read poetry, I find myself thinking hard about what this means, and not enjoying it. I find myself enjoying reading the prose interpretations of poems from people who appreciate poetry more than I enjoy the poems themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the point is, if other people do find this good, and it does serve as a road map to their understanding of life and the human condition, who are we to tell them that&amp;#39;s not the right way to do it.

But I suspect that&amp;#39;s exactly how I sound to a poetry lover. Better to just accept that poetry works for them the same way music does for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: Saudi Arabia should be removed from the United Nations and stripped of all advantages that come with being part of the UN, due to their sexist governmental policies, harsh laws, and blatant human rights abuses","Not only does Saudi Arabia violate the basic rights of every human being, several of the rights they infringe on are in direct and gross violation of the [United Nations Human Rights Declaration](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/) set down by the United Nations after the atrocities of World War II. For specifics, the Saudi Arabian government violates:  * Article 3  &gt; Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.  If one observes the practices of the Sharia Law set forth in Saudi Arabia, it becomes clear that these are clearly not respected rights. For one, the women of Saudi Arabia are the subjects and objects of their husbands, having hardly any right to life, as they can be killed for vaguely defined reasons such as ""dishonouring the family"" or ""acting in a manner unbefitting of a woman"". Even in the case of the Princesses of Saudi Arabia, there is no distinction. They can be punished as easily and publicly as a servant, without consequences under the law. This also violates their right to security, as they have no guarantee that the government will protect them against any abuses. By extension, their right to liberty is violated, as once again, the male of a house holds immense amounts of legal power over the female. Several examples are found in this quote:  &gt;Under Saudi law, every adult female must have a male relative as her ""guardian"", whose permission she is required to have in order to travel, study, or work.  Because of the bastardized version of Islam many of the powerful men of Saudi Arabia choose to follow, they interpret many things from their religious texts, including that women are the source of all evil, that they should not be allowed to study or work, and that if they do they will negatively affect everyone around them. Due to this, the right to liberty in Saudi Arabia for Saudi woman is not only de facto non-existant but also de jure non-existant. The Mutawa of Saudi Arabia are very powerful as they serve as the religious police. They are so powerful that they have the power to prosecute a member of the Saudi Royal Family, which, to my knowledge, has never been done. The point is that they serve as a very powerful force in the oppression of  women in Saudi Arabia, and given the power of Sharia Law over the Saudis, they easily cast shadows on the liberty of all the women of Saudi Arabia.  * Article 5  &gt;No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  This is probably the most infringed on right in the Kingdom. The punishments under the Law in Saudi Arabia include, but are not limited to, lashes, stoning, drowning, death by firing squad, death by crucifixion, death by beheading, with the option of public punishments, just as one would offer with a spectator sport. If Saudi Arabia allowed as much choice in the living of live as they did in the ending of life, they would be much better off.  Out of these items, three stand out. Cruxifiction, stoning, and beheading are all barbaric and extremely cruel ways of punishment. In the case of beheading, during the process, I can only imagine that the subject would experience immense pain as the executioner proceeded to cut through his throat, then the thick muscles of his neck, and then all the way through the spinal cord. There is no debate that this is a violation of Article 5. Cruxifiction , for those who don't know, means that you would be nailed to a plank of wood or some such surface to bleed out, or more likely, die of starvation or stoning while nailed to the wall like an animal skin. I'm not even going to bother explaining why that infringes son Article 5. Lastly, stoning. Since when has having stones hurled at you a normal punishment? Not only is it extremely degrading, it is also extremely cruel, and extremely stupid. I think I've said enough on this topic.  * Article 7  &gt;All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.  Women are not equal before the law. I mentioned it above under Article 3, but once again, it is blatantly clear that women are not treated as equals under the law. Not only are they completely unrepresented in the Saudi Arabian government, even the Royal women have barely any power. With a court system, law enforcement system, army, and executive system all run by men, I would find it very hard to believe that they are given equal protection or treatment under the law. The simple fact that it is completely legal for a man to kill his wife with ""proper reason"" is evidence enough for this point.  * Article 9  &gt;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.  I'm not even going to bother to explain this one myself, and I will instead leave you with [this](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30744693?ocid=socialflow_twitter), [this](http://www.arabianbusiness.com/saudi-arabia-executes-54-people-in-first-3-months-of-2015-588431.html), and [this](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/siti-zainab-saudi-arabia-beheads-mentally-ill-female-domestic-worker-angering-indonesia-1496492).  * Article 10  &gt;Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.  I'm losing steam writing about this, so I'll leave you with a few quotes to prove my point:  &gt;Western-based human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have criticized the activities of both the Mabahith and the Mutawa, as well as a number of other aspects of human rights in Saudi Arabia. These include the number of executions, the range of offenses which are subject to the death penalty, the lack of safeguards for the accused in the criminal justice system, the treatment of homosexuals, the use of torture, the lack of religious freedom, and the highly disadvantaged position of women. The Albert Shanker Institute and Freedom House have also reported that ""Saudi Arabia's practices diverge from the concept of the rule of law.""  &gt;Courts in Saudi Arabia observe few formalities and the country's first criminal procedure code, issued in 2001, has been largely ignored. Decisions are made without juries and usually by a single judge.  * Article 13  &gt;(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state. (2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.  Saudi woman require permission from the head of the house (husband, father, or male relative) to leave the country. They can be sequestered in their own homes and forbidden from leaving, returning, or any number of things that would restrict their movement. I quoted this above, but it is also relevant here:  &gt;Under Saudi law, every adult female must have a male relative as her ""guardian"", whose permission she is required to have in order to travel, study, or work.  * Article 16  &gt;(1) Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. (2) Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses. (3) The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.  Every single god damn right in Article 13 is utterly non-existant for the women of Saudi Arabia. They do NOT have equal rights during marriage, as a women has to go through the highly biased court systems to achieve a divorce whereas a man need only say, ""On this day I have divorced you."" They certainly do not marry with consent, teenage girls often marrying 55 or 60 year old men, maybe even older than their own father. And if you think that the family is protected under the law, from, say, a father threatening to execute his daughter for ""indecency"", then I advise you look into exactly how that doesn't happen.  * Article 18  &gt;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.  Saudi Arabia has a de jure restriction on the right of freedom of religion, as the only allowed religion is Sunni Islam, and Sunni Islam alone. No other denominations of Islam or ANY OTHER RELIGION are allowed to be practiced. Anyone marrying a Saudi citizen or attempting to be a Saudi national MUST convert to Islam, with no exceptions.   * Article 19  &gt;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.  Censoring of the media, of the press, and of the basic expression of thought through speech are all restricted heavily in Saudi Arabia. No further explanation is needed, simply look at the first article linked above under Article 9.  * Article 20  &gt;(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. (2) No one may be compelled to belong to an association.  The second point above is infringed on; by being forced to convert to Islam, you are also being forced to join the mosque and participate in practices such as praying at the specified times and observing religious customs as part of the mosque...unless you're a woman, in which case I don't believe that you are allowed in a mosque. But I may be wrong about this.  * Article 21  &gt;(1) Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives. (2) Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country. (3) The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.  They are a monarchy and a theocracy, breaking point three of Article 21. Women are allowed no representation in the government, breaking point one in Article 21. I don't believe there is a such thing as public service in Saudi Arabia, so point two can be entirely disregarded in this case.  * Article 23  &gt;(1) Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment. (2) Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work. (3) Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection. (4) Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.  Women DO NOT have the inherent right to work, nor the right to even have an education so that they might one day work. In the case of equal pay, women simply not being allowed to work takes care of that issue right there. Point three of Article 23 can be entirely ignored under these circumstances, and point 4 is entirely untrue in Saudi Arabia, as I doubt the poor laborers have ever heard of the word ""union"" used in that context.  * Article 26  &gt;(1) Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit. (2) Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. (3) Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.  WOMEN DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN EDUCATION. Again and again this will surface. Women are extremely restricted in all manner of ways, violating their basic rights as human beings. Furthermore, the one-sided Islamic based education that people are allowed to go through in Saudi Arabia is little more than indoctrination of the falsifications that have plagued the bastardized version of Islam all too many people think is the true interpretation of the religion!  Finally, I have finished cataloging all of their violations of ONLY the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This was **established by the UN itself** and is being **broken by one of it's main members**. If this isn't grounds for removal, I don't know what is.  I know Saudi Arabia is a large economic player, is one of the founding members of several Arab confederates and alliances, as well as a major player in OPEC, but by sending our (United States) President to that country, allowing them to serve in the United Nations, an organization committed to stopping violence and promoting fairness and equality, and maintaining an allied relationship with them is not only hypocritical, it is morally wrong. I don't see how one could argue that they shouldn't be removed from the United Nations, nor can I see how one could justify ANY of the actions or laws listed above.  If you want to change my mind, I'd be open to listening to the economic, geo-political, and military perspectives of this argument, but if you insist on arguing morality here, I'm open to hearing it.

CMV Why does humane treatment matter for animals destined for slaughter?,"Hello, I'm new to this sub. I am coming from [THIS THREAD](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1wabmp/usda_shuts_down_kosher_calf_slaughterhouse_after/).  I don't understand why it is important to some that animals that are to be slaughtered should be treated humanely. If they are going to die anyways, why should we put in extra effort to ensure that the animals are comfortable? I find it extremely hypocritical to sugarcoat the process of killing. Is it not just plain reality that humans own the food chain, and we bred these animals for consumption?  In addition, I cannot imagine even in nature where humane treatment occurs for carnivorous animals. Do other animals ever care about HOW they are killing a rabbit or deer that they are about to eat? Why are we expected to treat food like they are another sentient being with feelings? (That sounds weird but I can't think of another way to say it.) Isn't it natural to not have feelings for something that we are going to slaughter? (e.g. Fido for pet dog that we will keep as a companion vs #5936 for the cow that I will get ribeye steak from).   I never really empathized with animal rights people when it came to animals that were being utilized for human consumption (including vaccine testing and to a certain extent, various product testing). Please help me understand.  EDIT: Thank you all for replying. I would like to refine my question a bit more...  I understand that we are morally able and that we are above other predators observed in nature in that ethical sense. I know that it sucks to be the animal being submitted to pain and killing. But as a low income meat lover, why should I care when the free range chicken is more expensive than tyson, or some other big name meat brand? As I stated in my reply to /u/confictedfelon, how does humane treatment policies affect cost and availability of meat?    EDIT 2: /u/fnredditacct received a delta for convincing me on a personal scale that I can relate to. I always had gas problems, and I go through more than a dozen eggs a week. She mentioned that her family experienced less gas, and felt fuller with the eggs. I was able to confirm most of her points after trying the organic ones myself.   However, I think I am still somewhat unconvinced about some of the other things. This I realize is mostly based on the fact that I have very little understanding of what ethics is. I understand it on a basic level, such as don't hurt others, but when it came to weighing animals' rights to my own satisfactions, that became a bit skewed. I will attempt to learn a bit more on my own how this factors in. Please feel free to enlighten me a bit more in this area.   In addition, some are still under the impression that I WANT to TORTURE the animals before slaughter. Please let me clarify by saying that I do NOT want animals to be tortured. Torture implies an intent to hurt. I guess I am more faithful in the butchers that they are not sociopaths that want to torture animals, and that if an animal experiences a lot of pain in the kill process that they are a more rare occurrence. Again, I am most likely operating here under limited knowledge. Regardless, I fully understand that pain and suffering is unnecessary, and I hope that we can provide pain-free meat for people like me. But until we can somehow bridge the cost gap between free range and organic meats vs big brand meats, I will most likely be forced to remain in the cheaper meat section.    Thank you all for your participation! I still learned a lot!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to come from a different angle on this.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many of these &amp;quot;humane&amp;quot; treatments are good not just so the animal can live a &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot; life, but also because they protect the health of the animal we consume.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Inhumane treatments that pack animals in so tightly they can&amp;#39;t move   mean they are packed in their own feces they can&amp;#39;t get out of. Which  can cause contamination of the meat we eat, and means it gets washed in ammonia, also not good for us. (and not necessary if the the carcasses entering the facility aren&amp;#39;t covered in shit).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Free range (actual free range, not just let out for an hour a day) chickens make different eggs than cooped up chickens because they eat a different diet. Chickens that get to run around and eat what they want eat bugs and grubs. Chickens pinned up in coops they can&amp;#39;t move in not only live in their own fifth and the rotten remains of dead chickens, but also eat whatever cheap grain diet they are fed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those are just two examples.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of us are going to die just like those animals. Does that mean that our comfort doesn&amp;#39;t matter? The destiny of all things is to die so their lives are all they have. We should offer them at least some measure of comfort or at least minimize their pain.  Why treat them badly simply for being born a cow or pig or chicken. We don&amp;#39;t have to put the animal through hardship that could be avoided. Animals don&amp;#39;t understand that the way they kill animals matters. But we are sophisticated enough to understand their pain and so we should avoid it whether or not animals in nature act that way. Just because something is destined to be slaughtered doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it can&amp;#39;t be happy. A chicken who loves it&amp;#39;s life freely and with safety on a nice farm and is killed lived as good a life as a chicken can. Why not strive to give all animals that kind of life?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: Fast food joints should be completely automated,"Work in fast food places is one of the most mundane and monotonous. It could and should be totally or nearly totally automated. Let's start with cooking, no one will notice if robots will start flipping burgers. Next step should be cashiers. Ideally every fast food place should have 1 on duty operator, that will just oversee things and do stuff that can't be done by robots.  Reasons I think this is good idea is that it would make fast food even more affordable and it will push economies even closer to state of post scarcity. Also it would promote and popularize wide automation to end consumer. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually think this is going to be a lot harder than you think it is and comes down to human customization. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fast food work can seen mundane and repetitive and often is, but there are legitimate skills that are practiced there. Back in the day when I worked at McDonalds, we were regularly rated one of the best in the country (for our size) and it was because we were capable of reacting very well to customer demands and we had people who were very good at dealing with dual processes and were able to make intuitive jumps over what aspect of the food production they needed to jump into.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The amount of quick decision making that happens in a fast food restaurant shouldn&amp;#39;t be discounted. It will take robots a long time to think and do that quickly and to be able to optimize for predictive trends. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;#39;d ask a very basic question: what do you do with the workers?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the technology arrives, it will be...but AI hasnt gotten there yet...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Im a mechanical engineer who works in a factory with robots, granted its not Watson state-of-the-art tech, but they fuck up a lot more often than most people would think. Its just not as simple as &amp;quot;automate ALL of the &amp;quot;street-sweeper&amp;quot; jobs!!&amp;quot;...if you automate it, u&amp;#39;ll need on-site maintenance crews to fix it when it breaks, which is a whole hell of a lot more expensive than a 16 yr old at min wage (unless ur in denmark or something), not to mention the initial capital costs would be staggering compared to current initial capital required to build a place like wendy&amp;#39;s...but back to the part where they break down: 16 year olds dont stop working because of a broken ball bearing or bug in the code, whereas automation does and so now u are talking about lost profit during downtime required to fix the robots and customer dissatisfaction which effects future profits...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are tons of other things too, but i think just the aforementioned is enough to deter implementation of automation in fast food, at least for the time being...one day we will have a bunch of I Robots running around, but today is not that day nor is tomorrow&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"I believe that ""holidays"" such as Veteran's Day, Memorial Day, Columbus Day, etc. should not be considered federal holidays and should not warrant days off from work or school. CMV","I do not think that these holidays warrant a school shutting down or businesses giving all of their workers the day off. The day is not likely to be spent by most people in a way that is to respect those for the holiday, at least not enough to warrant an entire free day. Respects can be paid while still getting your work done at school or work. The average person would not being doing enough things to pay respect for the cause that warrant their need to not fulfill their work or school responsibilities.  If a veteran wants to take veteran's day off, it should be up to the company or school as to whether they approve that day off.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What businesses are you talking about? A lot of business are still open on federal and state holidays. If a business decides to close for a day, they don&amp;#39;t need a reason or permission to do so. Your argument about expectation doesn&amp;#39;t really hold any value. Chick-fil-a is closed on Sunday because Jesus, I have an expectation that businesses should be open every day of the week so therefore they should be open so I can buy their delicious,  Jesus chicken. Schools and other publicly funded organizations are extensions of the government so they have every right to dictate standards which includes holidays. If a privately operated business wants close for a holiday, they do so of their own accord. Please link to whatever law you are taking about because I&amp;#39;m not finding it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit: I think this basically destroys your argument that business are forced to do anything. In the US at least. &lt;a href=""http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/wages/holiday.htm""&gt;http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/wages/holiday.htm&lt;/a&gt; The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not require payment for time not worked, such as vacations or holidays (federal or otherwise). These benefits are generally a matter of agreement between an employer and an employee (or the employee&amp;#39;s representative).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerning the issue of schools, they are government run and the government observes these holidays for several reasons beyond the scope of what you&amp;#39;re considering. With schools specifically, if not enough of the student body shows up they can bleed a fairly substantial amount of money on teaching wages/educational hours because if Mom or Dad has the day off because they&amp;#39;re  a vet there&amp;#39;s a fair inclination they&amp;#39;ll keep the kids home and have a barbecue/some kind of recreational time. No this is not a direct observance of the onset of the holiday, but this is an observance of celebrating why the holiday exists. This is why it&amp;#39;s often custom to give the Monday after spring break off as a travel/recuperation day because a substantial amount of the student body is usually out of state/country for the duration of their break, therefore it&amp;#39;s better to not utilize resources on a day where students are less likely to attend.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Respects being paid&amp;quot; is a highly subjective approach to the issue though. If I celebrate my veteran friends by buying them a 12 pack of beer and hanging out with them, how is it any different than going and offering prayer or service?  Neither technically takes all day, but one of them leaves the individual in a position where it is both unprofessional and not safe to work. So if you&amp;#39;re going to observe a holiday in the first place you really have to account for the possibility of it being worth it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the whole I&amp;#39;d compare this mostly to taking your birthday off from work. Some companies offer paid days off for such occasions others do not. For the ones that don&amp;#39;t there are still people who will take a sick day to properly enjoy something important to them. It just so happens that if enough people did that on a single day it could be catastrophic from a business standpoint, so more often than not it&amp;#39;s best just to avoid it by giving either severe warnings/discipline ( A applicant deterrent) or to just give everyone the day off, which shows a lot of good will and may very well improve the workplace for the week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0

In other words, I do not like it when politicians and entertainers call on me to boycott or protest something that does not affect me personally.

CMV: If you outlaw guns and only outlaws will have guns. I'm fine with this.,"Actually I'm fine with that. Imagine if guns were outlawed. Now the price for an illegal one just went through the roof. Think your average gang banger would have one? How many meth heads would keep a pistol when they could sell it for mad amounts of cash? The lower end of the criminal underworld would be flushed of guns almost overnight.  Only the richest bad guys would have guns and those aren't the guys mugging people, breaking into houses or committing armed robbery. Hand guns would be worth their weight in gold on the black market. You wouldn't risk losing yours over a few bucks in the Quickiemart till.  You wouldn't want to shoot someone and just throw it off a bridge.  It would be like mugging a guy by hitting him with a gold brick.  Another interesting effect would be more investigation into the gun violence that would still occur.  Law enforcement would be much more motivated and have more time to pursue gun violence.  For example, if a kid gets shot everyday in South Chicago it's not nearly such a big deal as if a kid gets shot once a year.  I worded all that poorly but I think you'll get my drift.  As time goes by replacement parts and ammo get harder and more expensive to obtain contributing to a feed back loop resulting in guns becoming even more scarce and valuable.  I'm not advocating for outlawing firearms in America.  I own two rifles and a shotgun myself and I lean far left politically.  I just think the whole ""only outlaws will have guns"" argument is really weak.  Since it's a controversial subject I'd ask everyone to stick to discussing this **particular** view.  Thanks!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in Australia, so understand that my statements come from a position where gun ownership is heavily restricted and normal people agree with that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gun ownership and gun violence are not the same thing. There are many examples of highly armed countries with less gun violence than you&amp;#39;d expect based on the American experience.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem, as I see it, is the gun culture of America. The virtually unrestricted ownership and use of weapons in America is a serious problem. Gun violence that would be denounced as unacceptable has become a baseline of the normal experience of living in America.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Changing culture is incredibly difficult. No amount of changing the law is going to do anything if the people refuse to stand by those changes. &lt;strong&gt;If you outlaw guns, it is people that want guns (including, but not limited to criminals) who will have guns. Culture overrides the law.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;#39;s talk about prohibition from the Australian perspective:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I cannot own any gun because I am excluded from the criteria necessary by virtue of my mental illness. Any diagnosed mental illness excludes you. So that&amp;#39;s 20%-25% of the population out of the equation straight away.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you can own a gun legally (ie. you have a legitimate need. Hobby shooters, farmers, some security guards, etc.) then what kind of gun is also heavily restricted. By American standards, 90% of our weapons are pea shooters.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If I wanted an illegal weapon, I could get one (I&amp;#39;ve heard approx. $500 AUD ($462 USD) for a loaded handgun). Just like if I want drugs, I can get them. There&amp;#39;s always a market for anything that is illegal (that being said, the market for guns is pretty small - most crime here is unarmed).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Prohibition works here not because prohibition is particularly effective in its own right, but because people don&amp;#39;t want guns. If I knew someone that owned a gun for no good reason I&amp;#39;d assume they were a nutter or a creep and avoid them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is the amount of guns that are in the US already, and the land border with Mexico. Countries such as the UK and Australia who have enacted gun control very successfully don&amp;#39;t/didn&amp;#39;t have these problems and so it was much easier. In the UK, I live in the city with the highest gun crime per population (shout out to Birmingham) and even then there are very few guns in the city, i knew a person who bought a gun and got imprisoned for it - he spent £300+ on it ($500 roughly) and it was a converted BB gun which probably would have blown his hand off if he&amp;#39;d used it. There are very few viable guns in the UK that aren&amp;#39;t shotguns owned by farmers or gamekeepers, but this wouldn&amp;#39;t be the case with the US, where there are millions of guns already, and not just old service revolvers either. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0

I believe that motive shouldn't be taken into account in murder trials. CMV,"I've been watching the news lately, and there have been a lot of murder trials where the amount of leeway given to judges in terms of sentencing. For example, in [a local case in Minneapolis](http://www.startribune.com/local/east/233333381.html), he was found guilty of ""second degree unintentional murder.""  Minnesota law defines second-degree unintentional murder as an act causing the death of “a human being, without intent to effect the death of any person, while committing or attempting to commit a felony offense other than criminal sexual conduct in the first or second degree with force or violence or a drive-by shooting …”  I think this is rediculous. If someone kills someone by beating them to death ""without meaning to"", what difference does it make? They killed someone, and I don't think that there should be a difference whether it was premeditated to kill a specific person, if you plan to kill someone but not a specific person (gang violence), or you kill someone on a spur of the moment. Barring extenuating circumstances like self defense, I believe that if you murder someone, motives shouldn't be taken into account even if you ""accidentally"" beat someone to death. CMV.  Edit: I apologize for this but I had a bunch of stuff come up an hour after I posted this so I couldn't continue arguments. However, I've been checking in over the last day, and there have been some fantastic arguments on here, and while I still think that in many cases like I gave of ""second degree unintentional homicide"" are pretty ridiculous, there has to be a line drawn somewhere in which (as was pointed out to me by /u/uniptf where motive is pretty irrelevant in a trial, but intent is what is taken into consideration) intent is taken into consideration. Intent should be taken into account to a point. I still have a lot of thinking to do before I finally decide on where that line is drawn.  I have to also have to say that while I may think that self-defense isn't murder, if you completely disregard intent, then it is a flawed argument on my part. As many of you have pointed out, the different degrees of the crime are ways of making sure that those who murdered someone get at least some sort of justice. I also have to thank /u/learhpa for pointing out that in order for something to be considered a crime, you have to have a ""criminal intent"" towards this.   I'm going to go through everyone's arguments and respond/award deltas for those who gave me a different perspective and at least changed part of my viewpoint on this.   Last of all, I just have to say I really enjoy this sub.

CMV: Muslims are the most discriminated against in general (on Reddit and in the UK),"Hi CMV!  I'm brown (british born as are my parents) and whilst I was raised in a muslim environment, I'm agnostic (due to the existence of suffering) but still like the tenants of fasting/giving to charity which I still follow. (copied from my r/ukpolitics post)  I have been using reddit for a long time now and the more I use it, the more I become jaded as a person. Whenever I visit most parts of reddit which holds any political views, any topic on muslims or topics about those who are generally identify as muslims are filled with a huge amount of bigotry and racist remarks in general. Often, this is upvoted into the thousands and leave me feel exhausted and shunned by the community.   The most upvoted posts are those which portray islam and muslims in a negative light whilst posts which show them in a positive light are often downvoted and so is not seen by the majority of people. Terrorism is ofcourse bad, but the comments on articles about muslims/islam differ massively from those on other posts. i.e. The posts about rotherham vs. the parliment child abuse scandal, torture/murder by people of muslim origin vs. those who are non-muslim (or the ones I normally see: White/American i.e. iraq torture and murder cases, Guantanamo other clear cases of torture). There is often a lot of patriotic/nationlistic comments which are positively upvoted and defended in subreddits like r/worldnews or r/news.  Further, the comments become a giant circle jerk (for lack of a better word) of what is wrong with Muslims and how they aren't British and should be deported etc. At what point do you think this is inappropriate? As non-white people are in the minority on Reddit, and brown people are minority of that minority again, I feel as if we are largely ignored or attacked by the people who hold the prevailing opinion judging by the previous comments on posts and my own experience. For example: http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/humza-yousaf-demands-action-ukip-5346355 where a politician was likening him to a known terrorist. Articles such as these includes comments deflecting away from the issue or saying it was a 'joke' and instead attacking the person in question. Comments like these happen on a regular basis (judging from the topics I have read regarding Muslims in general on this r/ukpolitics, r/unitedkingdom, r/news, r/worldnews etc).  http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2zdks5/humza_yousaf_demands_action_against_coburn_ukip/  It is depressing for me to read articles such as the one below and reading the comments that follow. Following from Farage's comments about ""removing anti-discrimination"" laws, do you think this problem will become worse?  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-muslims-face-worst-job-discrimination-of-any-minority-group-9893211.html  What can be done, if anything, to increases engagement from non-white people on this subreddit to share their views and opinions? I feel as having people from different cultures on here would help greatly in discussions. However, I feel that the tone of the comments and just the number differential in terms or race/religion is a huge turn off (in my experience anyway  Regarding terrorism and the reason for it: I feel as more and more Muslims are feeling shunned and are victims of racism. Just today I was on the train to Glasgow and heard someone (right next to me) say that ""All paki's should fuck off back to pakistan and take their mosques with them. They can't make them in this country"". Comments like these aren't rare and the racism we experience is very real. I dont like the fact that it is underplayed by (almost) Reddit as a whole. The racism against white people however, is generally given more attention to. Whilst both cases are obviously horrible, I feel as if racism against people who are from the middle east is becoming more accepted (I'm british born and so are my parents, but the racism still affects me)... What can we do to reduce this? Further, I feel as if most terrorists aren't in it for  the ""rape and beheadings"" but largely want to fight back against what was done to them and the people they consider their families: See the war crimes committed in iraq or palestine for example. Do you think this is a bigger problem than the religion they follow? Do you feel as if they use religion as their excuse or do you think that they do it for the self defence/revenge aspect? What are your thoughts on this?  Further, I feel as if propaganda is rife in various subreddits. For example, it is not unusual for me to click on a link which says something negative about pakistani's in the UK or pakistan/muslims in general and the commenters usually post stuff in r/india or pro-israel or just hate muslims in general. I have visited these subreddit and in general (I just lurk and this is my 2nd reddit post ever besides my main account which only posts about dragon age or final fantasy) like most subreddits, they hold a ""pro-themselves"" attitude. However, there is a clear difference when discussing violence against hindus/christians/jews (which is regularly upvoted) vs. violence vs. muslims (which there is a clear difference in the % of upvotes and of how many reach the front page. I feel as if we are outnumbered and as a result, our voices aren't heard and the propaganda is in free-flow.  In general, I feel like my identity is shunned by the community on reddit as a whole to the point that I do not feel like engaging. I think it is incredibly tiring to argue when you are clearly outnumbered and as such, I do not think many people who are brown would considering joining the community. As a result, I feel that Reddit as a whole becomes an echo chamber where some of the worst comments have at-least some support and there is almost no participation from people who aren't white and so generally, what you guys see and think make up the majority (if not all) of what is discussed and what the prevailing opinions of the subreddit are. What are your thoughts about this? I feel that his needs to change but won't happen soon...  From this long text, it may not be clear which view I want you to change. To be clearer, I would like you to change/challenge me on the following:  - Most of Reddit's bigotry is aimed at Muslims which is incredibly unfair.  - Reddit is an echo chamber of its demography's most prevalent opinions which by large is from the eyes of white people. As a result, it is difficult to have my voice heard specifically in race/religion/political issues. I'm talking r/worldnews and similar subreddits.   For the second point, I don't mean to imply anything bad about it except that most upvoted topics are about what people can relate to and I feel as if posts (mainly political posts) about minorities are filled with more bigotry/racism than any other.   Can you change these views I hold!  I apologize for any errors in this post. I don't really know how to use Reddit.   Edit: I will be back from Uni to answer the posts later!  Edit 2: Sorry guys, I won't be replying anymore. I have some coursework to hand in for this Friday and I haven't really started. I can't say my views have been significantly altered, especially regarding point 2, however, It is clear the problem is more complex than I originally thought.

That is, Romani Gypsies who are fiercely hated &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; by the progressive Europeans, but also by pretty much everyone else. Hating Gypsies is something so common and something so accepted that someone can openly say &amp;quot;I wish hitler wiped out the gypsies&amp;quot; on reddit and receive upvotes along with a million comments about why gypsies suck. Even you OP probably dislike and have negative attitudes toward gypsies, its ok, I do as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The fact that hate for Islam is so prevalent is in of itself almost a good thing.

I believe that it is wrong to give money to homeless people and beggars. Please CMV.,"I've met enough people who work in social services and homeless outreach who condemn the practice of giving money to homeless people, beggars and pan handlers. The reasons being that reliably, the money is spent on drugs and alcohol and not actually food, or whatever stated reason they are asking for money. This does not actually help the person as it just helps continue their substance abuse problems. The alternative is to donate money/clothes or volunteer to local homeless outreach and social services instead. This way your contribution can be handled by people who will insure that those who need help who *are willing to get it* will receive it.  Go ahead, change my view.  **EDIT 1** I've got to step out of the house for a couple of hours, but will return straight away to continue the debate. Thank you all for chiming in. I appreciate the conversation.   **EDIT 2** Thanks to /u/Bigmanbeats for changing my view. Thanks to the rest of you for a thoughtful discussion on the matter. Cheers.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve wrestled with this myself. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s similar to the tipping scene on Reservoir Dogs for me. Mr. Pink will never start a non-tipping revolution. I think it&amp;#39;s far too ingrained in our society to change it. Simiarly, giving change to the homeless would require a massive shift in our culture. I&amp;#39;d like to think I&amp;#39;m doing good by standing up for my beliefs, but in reality even if I took up the mantle and cause of &amp;quot;stop giving to the homeless&amp;quot;, without a massive shift in our culture, it&amp;#39;s going to be like trying to change something that is right down close to instinct. Changing things like racism, or smoking were easier because they were enough of a problem for enough people that there came a tipping point. You have seen changes to laws in big cities when it became enough of a problem to enough people (we saw changes to laws regarding aggressive panhandling in New York for example), but only because of that tipping point, and only because it became a problem for enough people. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I thing benign panhandling, such as sign holding or &amp;quot;spare some change? God Bless&amp;quot; are a mild annoyance for most, and so we&amp;#39;ll always see some form of that. It will likely be similar to the unemployment rate having a static hover around 5.5%. Trying to eradicate panhandling which seems to hover around a natural percentage would be like trying to eradicate the static unemployment. It just seems to be a part of the way humans work in a society. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And so I&amp;#39;ve given up at &amp;#39;tilting at windmills&amp;#39; in that sense, that I think I can bend history and culture to my will. I can do so, but in very small, incremental ways, and usually only because the culture has reached that tipping point beyond what humans naturally can stand. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps when money is totally digital we might see a non-culturally based accidental shift because panhandlers will have nothing to panhandle.  Although likely it will be replaced by &amp;quot;spare some credits&amp;quot; followed by you swiping your hand over their hand and exchange 3 credits, or whatever equal money exchange we have in the future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Overall my point being that while I agree with you that it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, I can&amp;#39;t change it in the way that is meaningful. So I&amp;#39;m not arguing the morality of it, but maybe shifting the moral viewpoint to one that is more in line with reality. The reality of it is it&amp;#39;s a poor change strategy for you and I to stand on a Mr. Pink esque moral high ground.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;s my stance now? I make a charitable donation to social service agencies who support homeless help programs for housing and job placement. I also give very selectively to the homeless, in the way I give to my friends. I might give a guy some change and he buys some booze and it makes him feel better for a while. Engh, who cares, I made the choice because I wanted to give the change. I have an overweight friend who sometimes will come over for dinner. Does it mean I will only cook veggies and no carbs? Of course not. I know it&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;wrong&amp;#39; to support her unhealthy weight in the same way I know it&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;wrong&amp;#39; to give a homeless man change knowing he will use it for booze. But it&amp;#39;s not my decision to say.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I make those decisions independent of her choices, because they are hers to make. I&amp;#39;m not her moral compass. I don&amp;#39;t have to enable her behavior, but if I choose to engage with her in that way, I dissociate myself from responsibility. In the same way if a homeless person asks for change and I feel like giving it on that day, I give it to them independent of what they will do with it. You could say &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re just contributing to the problem&amp;quot; and I would say &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re right!&amp;quot;, in the same way you tell me that driving my car is killing the ozone, eating meat is destroying the ecosystem and giving my fat friend chocolate cake is killing her arteries. But I&amp;#39;m at least morally justified in holding my belief, knowing that my tiny drop in the bucket will mean so little, and the best way to make true change is to support realistic movements that bring about change. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr: It&amp;#39;s probably &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; to give to the homeless, but it&amp;#39;s not my decision what they do with the money and a lot of stuff is &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; but we still do it because of societal influences beyond our control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all let&amp;#39;s establish the aim of donating money at all: to help out those who need the money more than us. Whether that be cancer patients or starving children or homeless people, our aim is to help people on a large scale.  You are right in saying that donating to a local homeless outreach is a better use of your money if you want to contribute the greatest net help to the homeless community, but in a world where everyone is  &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; busy, &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; complaining about not having enough time to do the things that they want to do, how can you expect a large number of people to sacrifice their free time and money when they could be enjoying themselves? Sure, some people will take the time to go and donate to a homeless shelter or other social services but that is a small fraction of the total amount of people who &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to help, but feel they don&amp;#39;t have the time. Beggars exist for these people; good people who want to help with only a small time investment.  You also have to consider that most of the homeless population are where they are because their society, family, friends, or fate has been unjust or cruel. They are victims of circumstance, some of whom turn to alcohol or drugs to hide their pain. We should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; tell all the world&amp;#39;s busy people that giving money to beggars is bad thing, because we are telling these people, who aren&amp;#39;t going to donate their money elsewhere, that they should be just as unjust or cruel as the environment that forced the homeless into their terrible position. We should instead ask them to show compassion wherever they can, because it means a lot to those who have lived their lives &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; compassion. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the money goes to alcohol or drugs, so be it, at least some stranger&amp;#39;s compassion made an unfortunate fellow&amp;#39;s day just that bit happier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"I believe the American public school system is terrible, CMV.","I don't have a very informed view here, but it's one that the general public seems to hold and I have had until now.  The main reasoning I hear is that:  When ranked against other first world countries we're near the very bottom of the list.  Though, as I was working a customer bought this book, when I asked about it she said that the author talks about how the public education system isn't as bad as it seems and that those aforementioned statistics are taken from ourselves as an entire nation and are exaggerated.   (Exaggerated mainly by our privatized school systems in order to bash the public school system and therefore have more parents enroll their kids in private schools, in other words, greed.)   She bases this on the fact that these statistics include areas and states that are infamous for their stupidity, rednecks and hillbillies. (I'm not going to throw out any names)and if you were to take states such as NJ and Massachusetts and rank them separate we would be at or near the very top of the lists. Now I realize that this in itself points to a serious deficiency in the quality of our public school systems in at least some states, but maybe it truly isn't as bad as it is as a whole and I'd like to hear more on this argument.  PS: The book was Reign of Error.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American public school system is terrible at what, teaching students how to pass standardized tests?

Other countries track their students, such that if you test middle-of-the-road at a young age you won&amp;#39;t likely be given much chance to advance, and then test accordingly. They don&amp;#39;t expect students with learning disabilities to test at the same level as &amp;quot;gifted&amp;quot; students, while we do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Granted, there is a lot that can and needs to be improved on in public education system. But we do a very good job at getting students into college, and weeding out students whom a traditional education wouldn&amp;#39;t benefit. The proof is in the pudding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;When ranked against other first world countries we&amp;#39;re near the very bottom of the list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You can discount Shanghai and other oppressive countries that shove education down a kid&amp;#39;s throat harder than Pink Floyd could imagine.

CMV: Focusing too narrowly on the plot of movies is a shallow way of experiencing and critiquing them,"Often when I see movie criticism, either on Reddit or in person, I see people focusing on critiquing the plot of films. They'll say things like ""the story was great, up until *blank* and then it totally ruined it for me"". There is also a general focus on spoilers, plot holes, etc.   Now, I don't think there is necessarily anything wrong with people viewing film this way, I just think it's shallow. And I don't mean shallow in a wholly negative way, I just mean it as exactly as it is, shallow, close to the surface, without depth.   Films, as an art-form are an immensely complex and intriguing form of entertainment. They combine all the aspects of music, photography, writing, performing, digital effects and art, set design and sound production into an end result that can often be greater than the sum of its parts. To reduce all of these aspects of film to just the narrative of the story and the literal events of the movie is to ignore and not appreciate a massive part of the experience.   Not that plot isn't an important part of movies. I love movies with complex, interesting plots, but I also love movies without them. A complex narrative is in no way, a pre-requisit to a good movie. Just as it's not a requirement for a good novel or anything. It helps, and it can add to or make a good film even great, but it is not all there is.   Basically, my view is that modern mainstream critiquing of movies - what your family members discuss after leaving the cinema, or what people say around the water-cooler at work, (or what is often said in discussion posts of films at /r/movies, is far too focused on the plot of movies. Movie fans everywhere are doing themselves a disservice and would enjoy the movies they watch more if they changed the way they thought about them.   I equate it to people judging music solely on the lyrics.   So! please, try to change my view, as I am clearly in the minority. Why would it not be better for general audiences in general to be more well-rounded film viewers?  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Most movies, the main point is: this is what&amp;#39;s happening.  It&amp;#39;s hard to enjoy the second or third level of a film if the first level fails.  Why should I care about the symbolism or cinematography or soundtrack or whatever of a film if it&amp;#39;s occurring against the backdrop of &amp;quot;a bunch of shit is happening that I don&amp;#39;t care about?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And granted, this isn&amp;#39;t true for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; film.

CMV: The Pope driving around in fireproof glass is an admission of lack of faith,"Fact 1: The Pope believes in an all powerful being, a.k.a. God.  Fact 2: He also believes he is God's spokesperson on Earth, and as such, he should believe he is entitled to some sort of attention by the worshiped being.  Fact 3: Yet, he does not believe such being will protect him against a shot, hence using a manmade material to grant him that protection.  That's also valid for a number of other issues as well, like the use of medicine, for instance. If he believes that God has a masterplan, then his disease must be in those plans, and to look for treatment is a denial of God's will.  Even if the spokesperson part is wrong, isn't it a lack of faith that he doesn't think God would intervene for him?  I'm talking about the Pope because he, theoretically, has a deeper connection to the Catholic god.  Please, reddit, show me where I'm wrong :)  ***  Edit: So I think my view has been changed.  /u/Gekko_the_Great [explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/341ysq/cmv_the_pope_driving_around_in_fireproof_glass_is/cqqk0tn) there are practical reasons that force the Pope to use such car.  /u/Hq3473 [raised](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/341ysq/cmv_the_pope_driving_around_in_fireproof_glass_is/cqqhtfd) interesting questions about how much is a person expected to do in order to ""help themselves"".  /u/MrMoby [pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/341ysq/cmv_the_pope_driving_around_in_fireproof_glass_is/cqqjryw) that the Catholic God is supposed to remain uninvolved in His creation, due to free will.  /u/chicagofirefifa2 [presented](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/341ysq/cmv_the_pope_driving_around_in_fireproof_glass_is/cqqwjop) a theoretical possibility of God and evil existing in the same world and thus rendering the Pope's action necessary.  My view has been changed in the way of understanding how the pope, in his catholic belief, would make sense of such contradictory behaviors (1. God will provide, but 2. Just in case He doesn't I'll take care of myself).   But the Catholic understanding still leaves a lot of open questions. Apart from my original post (which is already resolved), I think our wonderful debate still leaves unanswered the questions of   1. how moral can an omnipotent Being be if He allows harm to be done within his creation (specially when the answer of ""respecting free will"" is so fickled in sight of the pain those free creatures actually cause. And there's the question about accidents and natural disasters...);  2. how could free will and omniscience exist in the same world (and also how does God's will fit in a world of human will supremacy, as people argued).  But I think those are topics for another CMV.   Thanks a lot, guys. You were amazing!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, and I have to get this out there, if he actually did what you suggested, denying protection and medicine, wouldn&amp;#39;t you surely view him as an idiot anyway? It in no way would affirm his faith in your eyes, right? Can we be clear on that aspect before going on?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for the popemobile it&amp;#39;s actually very simply explained. The states he is visiting strongly insist upon him using it after the assassination attempt on the John Paul II. He currently still has relatively unprotected contact with people in the Vatican. Yes, there is his Guard and all this protection and he uses medicine and this is probably the crux of your issue. Why would you think he should not help himself to this? Denying medicine and putting yourself in life threatening situations at the mercy of god is considered testing god in an unfaithful way and it&amp;#39;s definitely not something that you are supposed to do. Anybody who believes this is wrong, and I say again that it would gather no respect from you, me or anybody of faith or not if they acted this way. IIRC a good precedent is Jesus&amp;#39;s tribulations with the devil. The devil asked him to throw himself from a temple, and that god should send angels to catch him, Jesus refused saying that it is not right to test god. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To not seek help and help yourself is the biggest denial of gods work and common sense. If you were created with the sense to do it, do it. You&amp;#39;re looking for a &amp;quot;gotcha&amp;quot; to hundreds and hundreds of years of tradition, you haven&amp;#39;t found it.

That kind of makes it difficult to see the effect that italics have by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The normal way of using italics is to provide emphasis on the appropriate word in writing, because normally this would be done with tonal inflection when speaking.  I&amp;#39;m sure you understand why we don&amp;#39;t talk in a flat monotone voice...emphasis provides meaning...and that&amp;#39;s the same reason we use italics in writing.  Here&amp;#39;s a classic example:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; didn&amp;#39;t say you stole my money.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; say you stole my money.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; you stole my money.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t say &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; stole my money.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t say you &lt;em&gt;stole&lt;/em&gt; my money.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t say you stole &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; money.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t say you stole my &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Every one of those sentences means something completely different, just as they would if spoken with that same differing inflection.

He said that he would cite anyone who helped him in his paper.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I honestly don’t have words for how bad an idea it is to cite random anonymous strangers from the internet in a paper. Putting the never in italics put extra emphasis on that this not something you should ever do.

CMV: I feel that wealthy should pay a flat tax rather than the current progressive US tax system.,"I'm moving to Singapore in the coming months and discovered that they have basically a flat tax system (much lower rate than US) on income and have heavy luxury taxes on items like cars and brand named clothing. Many employees in my company are relocating to different parts of Asia because their tax burden is too heavy especially in European countries.

CMV: /r/atheism should be renamed to /r/antitheism,"If you go to /r/atheism or even /r/atheismrebooted, you're likely to find more posts denigrating religion than posts about atheism itself. Instead of discussing the reasons for atheism or what follows from it, for example, many of those on the subreddits focus on either laughing at theists or arguing against religious beliefs and for humanist ones. If the subreddits are to be used in these ways, they shouldn't be named as if they're about anything other than antitheism. Atheism is a lack of belief in a deity, and nothing more.

"CMV: The Penalty Shootout in Football(soccer) is an anti-climactic cop out, and a horrible way to settle ties.","I'll preface this by saying I don't know a ton about soccer. I like watching FIFA games with friends but I'm very oblivious to the nuances and finer points of the game. As an American, there is a whole laundry list of problems and criticisms we have with football. Personally, tie resolution is what really bothers me. And to top it off, this method of tie breaking is used in tournaments, where the soul purpose is to decide the best *team* in the league/world.  I understand that football is a low scoring game and that goals can be rare. Putting that aside, it almost seems disgraceful that the game can be decided by basically playing a mini-game. I believe you should win the game, by winning *the actual game*, not a side game that only involves one player from each opposing team. I don't understand how anyone could be satisfied with a victory or loss through the shootout.   I don't understand why there can't be an NHL playoffs style overtime, where the first goal in the overtime wins the whole thing. If player fatigue is an issue, create separate play periods with rest time inbetween. At worst, just schedule a rematch the next day, anything to actually give me a definitive conclusion. I need to feel like the team that won played better football in the match, not a better shootout.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Playing 90 minutes with a tie results in two more 15 minute halves, for a total of a 30 minute overtime. Making obviously a total of 120 minutes of game time. When 8 of your players are unable to be subbed, and have been playing for 2 solid hours, you&amp;#39;re gonna be pushing even the most polished soccer players to the limit. If the shootout were done away with, we could potentially have four or five, if not more overtimes on rare occasions. I don&amp;#39;t imagine anyone other than real marathon runners could sustain any sort of high level of play when their legs are breaking down, and have been for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If two teams make it to a shootout, then they&amp;#39;ve already played 2 hours without a winner being decided. So naturally, the teams are more than likely fairly level in terms of their level of play that day. I would feel even more robbed if I were to watch a triple overtime soccer game, and some random fluke goal decided the winner. Maybe you feel differently though. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maybe I just think a shootout is more exciting to watch because I remember being a part of so many of them growing up. Our team had an abnormally large amount of draws.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe you should win the game, by winning the actual game&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was once a time when after normal match time AND overtime, the two teams would play &amp;quot;golden goal&amp;quot; where the first team to score would win. Now I believe FIFA made away with this in the early 2000 for a few reasons&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams would play defensively as to stop their opponent from winning. If you have two teams that are 95% defense oriented, what a boring game that would be, eh? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever played 120 minutes of soccer? FIFA regulations only allow 3 substitutions. Not to mention 120 minutes of soccer in a hot climate? It&amp;#39;s hard. Hell, it&amp;#39;s super tough for the last 10 minutes in normal time. Prolonging a game unnecessesarily will not bring out the best in both teams. Personally, I don&amp;#39;t think you can measure how good a team is when they are playing for 120 minutes in a 95% defense oriented positioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand why there can&amp;#39;t be an NHL playoffs style overtime&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If I am not mistaken, ice hockey has infinite substitutions, so you can substitute fatigued players at will. Soccer, you&amp;#39;re going to have at least 8 players (from each team) that have been on the pitch for those full 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If player fatigue is an issue, create separate play periods with rest time inbetween&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Scheduling, times, money, etc. It just doesn&amp;#39;t work like that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;At worst, just schedule a rematch the next day&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fatigue doesn&amp;#39;t go away after a night, plus scheduling. Especially in the world cup where you&amp;#39;re going to have games going on in the stadiums are certain times PLUS travel time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Soccer players are not invincible. Asking them to play 120 minutes and then the next day play another 90 minutes is a hell of a lot. Not to mention teams have pretty strict schedules, especially during championchips and league games. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I know where you&amp;#39;re coming from becaues I, too, wanted the golden goal (or silver goal) to be the rule, but player fatigue is just too much of a concern, and lets face it, when players are fatigued, they are not going to play their best, and the team as a whole is going to play defense, which makes from a pretty boring game.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0

CMV: I believe crowdfunding is stupid. It is lazy and a waste of time and money.,"So earlier I saw [this post here on /r/changemyview](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2w96ml/cmv_a_friend_is_crowdsourcing_to_help_pay_for_her/) and it made me think of this belief that I've held for awhile. I believe that crowdfunding no matter the reason is stupid. I think it is lazy and a waste of time and money on both the requesting person's part and those who donate money to whatever it is they are sending money towards. Here's why.  First off, crowdsourcing is lazy in my opinion. Now in a capitalist society, people start a business with an idea or vision, then fund their ideas with their own personal money, though a few family members or friends may feel free/happy to give some money or help with said business idea. For example if I wanted to open a coffee shop in town, I'd fund the business idea and fruition with my personal bank account and if my parents and friends wanted to, they could send some spare cash my way, though I wouldn't expected them to nor are they obligated to do so. With crowdfunding, I feel like you're essentially begging for money via the internet. It's the internet equivalent of standing on a street corner with a tin can asking strangers for change. I think if you have an idea and you want to make it happen, you should be get it done yourself without begging your 200 Facebook friends for money. For example, one of my friends that I've known for years decided she wanted to go find the identity of her biological parents. She was adopted as an infant and doesn't know who her biological parents are. So she started a crowdfunding campaign asking for $2,000 to cover the expenses of finding her parents through an adoption agency. If I were in her shoes, I'd never ask for other people's money, I'd pay the bill all by myself instead of asking for money from other people via Facebook.  My next point is, I think crowdfunding is a waste of time and money, for both the requesting person(s) and the people that give money to whatever they're giving money to. It's waste of time for the person starting their campaign because most people will never see their idea get off the ground. Going back to what I said above, people don't like it when you go begging on the internet for money and most people won't donate because they don't like beggars. As for the funding part, I think people that donate money to a campaign on a crowdfunding are wasting their money. Most campaigns wil fail and there is no guarantee that you will get anything from your contribution. To me it would be analogous to going to Wal-Mart and buying a pen that doesn't exist in the store but hoping that someday they will sell it. If I give money to someone, I am expecting results. When I donate to charity I am under the impression that my donation will eventually go feed an underprivileged family or help an abused puppy, depending on who I'm donating to.  Lastly, since crowdfunding has gotten so big and anybody can start a crowdfunding campaign for just about anything, I think it takes away from true entrepreneurship and real ideas. Because crowdfunding is now more mainstreamed, just about anyone can go on and start a campaign for frivilous reason; ""I want to paint a portrait, give me money"" ""I want to travel to London for vacation, help me pay for the trip."" The most recent example of a stupid frivilous crowdfunding campaign was [this guy who raised $55,000 to make potato salad.](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/1/6880201/potato-stock-kickstarter-potato-salad-zack-danger-brown) He didn't have a revolutionary idea or a call to help out someone in dire need. All he wanted was potato salad. This kind of stuff puts me off from the whole idea of crowdfunding because now it seems like anyone can make up any reason to raise a few thousand dollars and people will be dumb enough to donate instead of standing up against bullshit projects.  So with my argument presented, I want someone to try to change my view, or at least give me reason to believe crowdfunding is a valid source to starting a business.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does it matter what people choose to do with their money? If people wanted to donate $55,000 to a guy so he can make a potato salad that&amp;#39;s on them. You do not lose anything out of it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are many things that wouldn&amp;#39;t have been possible without crowdfunding. Many indie type board games, expansions to previous things, ect. All these were deemed worthy by enough people that they felt the need to donate towards the cause. Even something good came out of that potato salad funding. A lot of local charities benefited from it. The guy threw a potato salad party that many people attended and had fun together. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not everyone has access to a lot of money. Now in our capitalistic society, I can either work at a job and save up enough money to fund that coffee shop idea (which will take me a long time to save up for that venture) or I can pitch the idea to other investors and have them provide me with some money in return for a portion of my company. This is no different but instead of investors, I&amp;#39;m offering the people who help source my project the actual project being completed and being available to them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see the difference between raising money on the internet vs raising it in any other way.  Is it the blue collar value that appeals too you?  I just don&amp;#39;t see what the distinction.  If people want to give a guy $55,000 to make potato salad.  Well good on him.  Its not for you to decide how other people spend their money.  People spend money on ridiculous things all the time.  I love college football.  If I was a billionaire, I would be making pretty big donations to the Nebraska football team.  Amounts that would seem unreasonable to most people.  So if some dude wants to give someone $100 to make potato salad for a joke, I don&amp;#39;t see the problem.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
I believe that some parts of Islam are extremely dangerous and should be questioned/examined vigorously. CMV.,"I believe some sects of Islam would be frowned upon if it was a secular group. For example, the undeniable lack of women's rights, female genital mutilation, the introduction of sharia law courts in the UK and not accepting homosexuals or condemning homosexual acts. The knee jerk reaction to the opinion I hold is that I'm a bigot or a racist and I can assure you that's not the case. My issue lies with Islam rather than Muslims. I have the same view against all dogmatic beliefs, including Christianity. It is a controversial view and, therefore, I want to make sure it is the product of reason rather than ignorance. I am not the most informed theologically but feel I know enough to make these claims.  Edit: My view has been changed. I would agree that there are definitely better ways to put this message across and that it would be seen as offensive to Muslims to even consider these extremists as Islamic.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What &amp;quot;sects of Islam&amp;quot; are you referring to? Or do you not know what a &amp;quot;sect&amp;quot; is? If a group of atheists banded together and advocated for FGM would you say that you think &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; atheists should be questioned/examined vigorously? You&amp;#39;d have too, but you&amp;#39;d question why you grouped them by their atheism. In turn, I must also question why you reinforce your view that it is Islam-dependent. You A.) acknowledge it isn&amp;#39;t all of Islam and B.) would still take issue with their behavior if they weren&amp;#39;t Islamic. Black people are imprisoned at a disproprotionate rate compared to their population in society. Should we not question/examine the criminality that infects &amp;quot;some sects&amp;quot; of black people? How does this not make you sound bigoted?   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your point isn&amp;#39;t invalid just distorted. No one will call you a bigot for advocating equal rights or humane treatment of homosexuals/women. No one. So if that is what you want present your argument in that manner. If you want to take up issues with &amp;quot;some sects&amp;quot; of Islam using vague or undefined understanding of who you are targeting, you will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; run the risk of being called bigoted because there is no way to tell for sure who that &amp;quot;some&amp;quot; is.   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Religion isn&amp;#39;t a target that you (or anyone) can take down and more so than race. It means very different things to everyone. Isolate your concern to &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what you have an issue without and you reduce the risk of catching the wrong people in your blanket statements (who will in turn stop seeing you as a bigot).  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m assuming you are from the UK as you&amp;#39;ve made multiple references to it, so forgive me if some things are different there.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know where you live, who you interact with on a daily basis or what you&amp;#39;ve experienced personally, but I&amp;#39;ve never met or even read of anyone who supported these things in a non-satirical manner that was also taken seriously.  It really &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; a controversial view; they are called &amp;quot;extremists&amp;quot; for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you ask the average muslim what they think of this stuff they will tell you its ridiculous and the people who espouse these beliefs are ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your argument seems a bit &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m gonna get super passionate and angry over this subject because no one seems to be angry enough&amp;quot;, which is fair since its logical to think that if people really were angry about it it wouldn&amp;#39;t be happening.  But you have to understand that just because people aren&amp;#39;t taking to the streets with baseball bats and machetes to take down the extremists that they &lt;em&gt;agree&lt;/em&gt; with them or even believe that their beliefs are &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;, it simply means that they are apathetic, occupied, afraid, etc.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As far as you being called a bigot goes, its probably your method of delivery.  After reading your other comments you seem very, very angry over this and are being way too aggressive.  Whether true or not, this comes across as you having a personal hatred for the people that practice the faith (since Islam is just an idea practiced by people you actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; hate Muslims, even if its only a small portion; remember, an idea is nothing without someone to practice it).  You may also be expressing your views in a way that makes it seem like you hate Islam (and therefore Muslims) as a whole as opposed to extremists.  This will make you come across as a bigot.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To summarize: you are preaching to the choir and your ideas are far from controversial.  If their ideas were normal we wouldn&amp;#39;t call them extreme.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I don't approve of gay pride parades. CMV.,"I have nothing against homosexuals and they deserve to be accepted in society and get married like everyone else but I believe the approach is all wrong.  I think it's wrong trying to promote gay pride by dressing in leather and latex.  If people want others to accept gays then they should make people see the gay community as morally upright people that most of them are instead of portraying themselves as kinky sex crazed people.  Also dressing lewd will do nothing but freak out the homophobes and disgust families that want things to be ""rated G"" for their young children.  I think all the things people do in gay pride parades just hurt their cause more than help it. That's why I believe gays should be a bit more family friendly if they want more acceptance. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing is, gay pride parades are not for the benefit of straight people. They exist, as the name implies, for the gay community to get together and show, to each other before anyone else, that they are proud to be who they are and that they don&amp;#39;t need to hide &lt;em&gt;as they have been forced to for centuries&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let me repeat, the object is not to convince straight people that gay people deserve the same rights as them. They are not there as a PR stunt of the gay community. They are an expression of a community of people that until &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; recently were told they were morally corrupt deviants who should be ashamed of themselves and were legally and extra-legally oppressed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The entire point of gay pride is that &lt;em&gt;they don&amp;#39;t care&lt;/em&gt; what straight people think; it&amp;#39;s precisely the day for them to say &amp;quot;I am who I am and I am doing nothing wrong, I don&amp;#39;t have to hide because you don&amp;#39;t approve of me!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And don&amp;#39;t worry; aside from gay pride parades there is a ton of activism being done by men and women in suits, who understand that they also need to dress in a &amp;quot;respectable&amp;quot; manner to reach out to certain groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, it was the kinksters, transvestites/transgender, and the prostitutes who fired the first shots in the modern gay rights struggle, back when respectable gays would hide in the closet and attack their own. &lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=stonewall+riots&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a""&gt;Go team!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Without the so-called freaks raising awareness in so blatant a way, you&amp;#39;d still have more of &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; kind of horror story. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although, seriously, &lt;a href=""http://www.davidmixner.com/2010/07/lgbt-history-the-decade-of-lobotomies-castration-and-institutions.html""&gt;that was nothing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, the wild parts of gay pride parades exist, as a small minority paying tribute to the courage of those who have lived before, and because nobody should have the right to silence those who are different, whether or not you approve of all that evil sex they&amp;#39;re having.

I believe murder is justifiable if there are no possible negative effects on society. CMV,"First of all, please note that my argument is purely theoretical, due to the fact that the positives and negatives of any action are never clear. I would never condone murder, simply because it cannot be known if any negative effects are to follow.  That being said, I would like to construct a possible scenario. There exists a homeless person in a major city; this person has no friends, no family alive, and nobody depends on this person or cares for this person. This person does nothing to contribute to society or any individual, he merely exists. Given this situation, I would think that the murder of this person is entirely justifiable, based on the idea that his/her death will have no negative effects on any person or on society.  I don't even see this as a negative for the person- if the death is instant and painless the person will never even know what happened. In death you can't bemoan your lack of life or regret the things you never did, because you're dead. So I don't see this as a negative for the individual in question. Another issue: what if this person had gone on to make a positive impact on society in the future? I think it's equally likely that this person could have gone on to make a negative impact on society, in which case you would be doing the world a favor. I get that murder is simply morally wrong to basically everybody, but logically I see nothing wrong with the murder of the individual I've described.  Just to clarify, I really don't mean for this to sound cold-blooded. When I've brought this up to friends they've mostly just responded with disgust or disapproval. However, nobody has really offered a counterargument to my view. So, CMV. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how you want your view to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Could your view be changed if justifiable does not just mean &amp;quot;no negative effects on person/society?&amp;quot; You state this as fact, but there could theoretically be arguments against it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Could your view be changed by the possibility of an afterlife. Where the person may discover what happened and be sad they missed out on life? If there is an afterlife, they wouldn&amp;#39;t technically be &amp;quot;people or society&amp;quot;, which follows issues with my first point.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You say possibility for contribution is not relevant. In that possibility for good cancels out with possibility for bad. This is again another statement of fact. Does your entire argument fall apart if your view on this changes? Are you open to such a change?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Positive&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;negative&amp;quot; are also undefined. Does a person who doubles the average lifespan of every human on the planet a good person with a &amp;quot;positive&amp;quot; contribution, given all the other issues that would follow from that? You acknowledge that effects are never really clear, but you never really define what these effects are, then you say that without these effects it&amp;#39;s okay to do X action.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your situation is entirely theoretical. I know that&amp;#39;s what you were after, but without any real-life relationships it&amp;#39;s difficult to really claim anything against it. By which I mean you are effectively saying:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;-Given a situation where this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;-Where the logic that follows from case to case is this.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;-Yielding a result where this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;-This result is good or bad depending on this criteria which I have determined.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Without a real-life relation or relevance, we&amp;#39;re confined within a set of reasoning that you have created. I don&amp;#39;t know how anyone can question this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have the right to life, and to live how they choose (within the rules set out by the government, etc). Firstly, acceptable murder would probably make society uneasy, so your &amp;#39;killing of a meaningless person&amp;#39; is itself a negative action for society. The point is though, the person has the right to not have their life taken away, specifically without a justifiable reason. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: I believe that those interested in the nature of truth should study Physics rather than Philosophy.,"By truth I do not mean factual statements such as ""Brett Favre used to be a quarterback for the Green Bay Packers"". Obviously, neither physics nor philosophy are useful for collecting trivia type knowledge. Also, I concede that philosophy has better tools equipped to understand moral truths. However, when it comes to understanding and discovering general characteristics belonging to existing things, I believe that physics is superior to philosophy. Here are a few reasons why.  *  Philosophy, since it is not experimental in nature, merely reorganizes knowledge and does not produce any new knowledge.    * Descriptions in mathematics are less ambiguous, more strictly logical, and lead to greater insights than descriptions in English or any other language.  *  Ideas in physics are much easier to test.   *  Philosophy has no defense against counter-intuitive truths such as ""objects have a probabilistic rather than a defined set of characteristics"". Hence, any study of truth within philosophy will be limited by our own imaginations or intuitions.    * Newtonian mechanics, Big Bang, quantum mechanics, and relativity have done more to revolutionize our understanding of truth than any theory in philosophy.   CMV!  Edit: Thank you all for your interesting response. I'm going to bed now, but I will try and answer more of your posts tomorrow. _____   &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

For instance there are multiple philosophies of life and death that are completely new, just like the concept of electrons or whatever. For example the concept of &amp;quot;karma&amp;quot; or afterlife or the lack of afterlife or the concept of one god or no god. But obviously these concepts cannot be tested and I don&amp;#39;t see how physics can ever answer them even if they do come up with a &amp;quot;unified theory&amp;quot; of how things work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t philosophy concern itself with things like &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s the right way to live?&amp;quot; and other questions of ethics that can never be classified into true or false boxes. Even if physics comes up with a set of all things empirically true or false, you still would not be able to answer the major philosophical questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Philosophy, since it is not experimental in nature, merely reorganizes knowledge and does not produce any new knowledge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the same token, does Mathematics not produce any new knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Philosophy has no defense against counter-intuitive truths such as &amp;quot;objects have a probabilistic rather than a defined set of characteristics&amp;quot;.

I think straight people do not belong in gay bars. CMV,"From my understanding after reading stories from numerous stories (I haven't actually frequented a gay bar myself due to lack of willing peers) that straight people are actually harmful at gay bars. The straight women go to avoid being hit on my straight men and to view the spectacle of gay men and women interacting. The straight men go to prey on unsuspecting straight women. And both the straight men and women will usually get insecure and/or insulted if a gay man or woman tries to hit on them. It seems unfair for gay men and women to have to deal with this in a place that is made for them.   edit: People seem to think that because I think that something should apply to one situation, it should be applied to all situations, which somehow leads back to racial segregation or not liking black people. I don't that way and just want to apply this to straight people in gay bars. Nothing else.   edit2: My views have been changed.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This view is the same as racial segregation. Saying that the two should be separate but equal is bigotry. We shouldn&amp;#39;t prevent straight people from attending a gay bar anymore than whites should be banned from black churches. There are &amp;quot;bad apples&amp;quot; from every group of people that exist. Judging the group based on individuals is the definition of prejudice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t respond to discrimination against one group by discriminating against another. Gay bars create a place where gay people can be at home and where homophobes are unwelcome. However, an exclusively gay bar is just as wrong as an exclusively straight bar.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is pretty stupid for straight people to be insecure or insulted when hit on by a gay person at a bar. However, this is not a problem to be fixed by policy, but by more open communication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"I believe open source software doesn't make sense in our current society, as it is basically giving away work for free. CMV.","Let me start by saying that, although I hold this view, I generally support open source and am aware of its transparency benefits.  With that said, i have some trouble understanding why someone is willing to develop so much software for free when it could potentially be giving them money. As we live in a society where work hours are translated into money, it seems like a waste to dedicate yourself to a product that won't give you any return. You are providing value to the user, so why wouldn't you get paid for it?  Not only that, but you are potentially ruining somebody else's business by developing a open source alternative, which is to say, you're kind of disrespecting the effort and work they've put on the product they're trying to sell by not even competing for the money.   Also, can you imagine if everyone went open source? There would be no money on software anymore, only infrastructure. Videogames, for example, wouldn't be what they are today. There would be no big push for innovation because there would be no money to be made.  I know there are some exceptions on making open source profitable (Red Hat, Firefox), but they are usually very specific and/or rely on somebody else's business.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;With that said, i have some trouble understanding why someone is willing to develop so much software for free when it could potentially be giving them money.

Because you want something to exist and dont care how you get it into existence.  Because there is already a project that does most of what you want, but not quite everything.  Because you want others to expand on your work and you want to be able to benefit from their free labor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not only that, but you are potentially ruining somebody else&amp;#39;s business by developing a open source alternative, which is to say, you&amp;#39;re kind of disrespecting the effort and work they&amp;#39;ve put on the product they&amp;#39;re trying to sell by not even competing for the money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Essence of capitalism.  Same quality lower price, should be easy to decide.  If another company created a product but charged just less than the competitor, would you complain about that?

You need something added to a project but are not an expert?  You pay somebody to provide to that project, add exactly what you need, and pay them to support it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You get what you want, the developer get paid, and the open source project benefits.  Where is the issue?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;With that said, i have some trouble understanding why someone is willing to develop so much software for free when it could potentially be giving them money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have a few small open source projects that I run. One of them is a library for C++ and Lua, and it does stuff that anyone can do, but I just took the time to clean it up a little bit and make the code clean and work well and document it. Realistically no one would ever pay me for it even though it is kind of snazzy. On the other hand, by making it open source, I&amp;#39;ve had contributions and feedback from a half dozen people that have resulted in a better library which I benefit from, as well as everyone else using it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even if I could make some small amount of money, I&amp;#39;d much rather just have it out there for me and others to use. I use libraries others have written and released for free because it saves me the effort of having to duplicate that work. I do the same. The code I wrote for that library is useful to others and not specific to my main project, why should I keep it to myself and force others to duplicate it my work? That&amp;#39;s just inefficient. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m one of the programmers for DeltaBot too, and there&amp;#39;s no way anyone would ever pay for our bot. However, we have received a few requests from other subs asking if they could use it or who wanted to know how it works. There&amp;#39;s literally 0 benefit to keeping it closed, so we open sourced it once it worked well enough that other people could make use of it&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we live in a society where work hours are translated into money, it seems like a waste to dedicate yourself to a product that won&amp;#39;t give you any return.

My time spent on my open source projects wasn&amp;#39;t wasted, I got lots of use out of them. And now others can too, I don&amp;#39;t need their money for the project to have been worthwhile to me. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But if you don&amp;#39;t care about altruistic reasons for open sourcing your stuff, there&amp;#39;s also the added benefit of having material I can put on my résumé too. And being a part of the open source community can get you talking to other people about the stuff you&amp;#39;ve worked on that you would not have otherwise met, and in doing so you can learn better ways to do things and become a better programmer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not only that, but you are potentially ruining somebody else&amp;#39;s business by developing a open source alternative, which is to say, you&amp;#39;re kind of disrespecting the effort and work they&amp;#39;ve put on the product they&amp;#39;re trying to sell by not even competing for the money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Free stuff is just another factor in the market. If someone else can&amp;#39;t compete with a free solution I&amp;#39;ve created to a problem, then they need to either improve their own product so that it can compete, provide some secondary service like support (e.g. RedHat) or doing some kind of hosting (e.g. DropBox). Their failed business strategy is not my problem. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, can you imagine if everyone went open source?

But either way, there are still ways to make money off open source software. Professionally I work on MMORPG&amp;#39;s, and even if we open sourced the game client, the users would still need to pay money to connect to our servers or to buy our services like rename tokens or new character slots. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For games that don&amp;#39;t require some kind of server connection, there&amp;#39;s also things like KickStarter, where you ask for the money up front to fund your project, then you could just release the finished product for free. This wouldn&amp;#39;t work for all kinds of projects of course, but I&amp;#39;m not arguing that all software should be open source either. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0

"CMV: There is no way to justify eating meat, dairy, or eggs.","We are in an environmental crisis, and we as individuals and as a society have an urgent responsibility to live as sustainably as possible. As explained in [this article](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/food-carbon-footprint-diet), a vegan diet has a much smaller carbon footprint than a normal western diet. I have stopped eating beef, and I now am beginning to feel that there is no way to justify continuing to eat other meat, eggs, and dairy.  I am not quite as concerned with the mistreatment of animals, although that is also disturbing.    I very desperately want my view changed. I enjoy eating meat, dairy and eggs and would like to continue doing so, but right now I am unable to feel guilt-free with a non-vegan diet.  EDIT: My view has changed from a wishy-washy belief that veganism is probably better to a steadfast position: There is no way to justify eating mass-produced or factory-farmed meat, dairy, or eggs or farmed fish.   And thanks to /u/Omnibeneviolent, I think I will try some vegan foods before deciding that I can't go without meat and dairy. I think my view was changed in the opposite direction than I had originally intended.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is not true for some of the more popular methods of farming (i.e. factory farming), there are models for raising livestock that are more efficient use of land than raising crops.  Some areas of land can simply not be effectively used to grow crops, but on some of them grazing can still be used.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A ranching model is a highly effective use of land and is more beneficial for local wildlife.  The monocultures associated with most crop growth methods does little to support wildlife, but grazing results in a decent variety of plants and also promotes edge effect (which is crucial for some species).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then there is hunting.  When properly organised and managed, hunting is a valuable tool for culling overpopulated and invasive species.  There are cases where killing the animals and doing nothing with the bodies would still be of net benefit tot he environment, and consuming the animals and turning them into various products is an added benefit and increases the efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You have to remember that being environmentally friendly is more than just carbon foot print.  You can be completely carbon neutral, but still render thousands of acres virtually unusable by any wild ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I am gonna take a different tact then most the people here. Some will talk about the environment or sustainability or nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But you want a justification. I justify eating meat by it being delicious to me and I enjoy it. That is all the justification I need. Will it one day become unsustainable to the point that I can&amp;#39;t afford it? Maybe. Is it to a point already where it is morally reprehensible to buy it and support that industry while that land could be used more efficiently? Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I want it. And I can get it. That is all the justification I need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV:If the biblical God exists, then he is as much or more responsible for human behaviour than humans are.","The typical Christian resolution to the problem of evil is to state that it is humans, through the exercise of their (presumably metaphysical) free will (a scientifically and philosophically implausible concept) have disobeyed god and brought sin and its attendant woes into existence.  Fine, let's assume that to be the case.  It is nevertheless unclear how God is obviated of moral responsibility even if we concede this to be the case, because he/she/it is omniscient.  If God is omniscient, then it knew the exact actions that humans would take.  If God knew the only outcome its actions would produce (creating the world and humans and then human disobedience) it follows that it is responsible for what it willed into being.  If I *know* that taking action x (creating the world and humans) will result in outcome y (human disobedience), I must naturally take responsibility when y occurs as a result of x instead of, say, z (human obedience)  The conclusion?  God, by virtue of omniscience, *must* be responsible for human disobedience, and he *must* have willed it.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey man, I think I got a good one, albeit kind of silly, if your still interested:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;God is the trinity, one being expressed as three separate but equal entities: the father, the son, and the holy spirit.  Free will is consistent with an omniscient, omnipotent creator god because while God may be these things, no single entity has all three traits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now I have never heard this expressesly stated, it us somewhat backed up by scripture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The father is the creator.  His role in the bible is as a parental figure, and is mostly associated with the creation of the Universe, and of Jesus, though he is ocassiobally mentor.  The father himself though has no direct connection to the universe, and is neither omniscient nor omnipotent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The holy spirit is omnipotent.  The father accomplishes all things through the holy spirit.  Adam was born when he was filled with the holy spirit.  The prophets and saints and gospel writers where inspired through by the holy spirit.  While god is the architect, the designer, the creator, it is the holy spirit that build reality.  The holy spirit is neither omniscient nor is he the creator.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The son is omniscient.  His role in the is mainly as a teacher.  Jesus spreads the word of the lord.  Jesus knows the nature of the holy spirit.  He straight up products the future a few times.  As the son of the creator, he himself is obviously bit the creator, and as a human he was not omnipotent, and ultimately died just like the rest of us.  He is neither the creator nor is he omnipotent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With the powers thusly divided, I hope you believe this leaves room for free will under the biblical god.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a mystical concept of reality, both God and humans are magical beings.  Human decisions are not deterministic, we can choose &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; as a result of our free will.  You may believe that our past history and training, our biology, our inherited response patterns, evolutionary pressure, social pressure, and any other relevant factors will force us to make a specific decision.  But we transcend all of that because we are magical beings.  Of course, you may not believe that, however, it does fit into the hypothetical situation which you have described.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The authors of the bible were telling us a parable to explain why the world is such a mess.  Why is childbirth so painful, does this indicate the perversity or sadism of the Creator?  How can we convince women to be always obedient to their husbands?  These, and other urgent questions are conveniently answered by the parable of the Garden of Eden and the Original Sin which happened there.  We cannot blame God for these things because God is much more powerful than we are, and He will punish us if we do not worship and obey him.  Get it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"I believe that we can change american school's by allowing students to evaulate their teachers, CMV","As a soon to be graduating high schooler, I see that the american education system is failing. mind you not in the ""sky is falling"" sense but in a slow nose dive to the earth. I believe that one of the solutions, of many, is too allow students to evalute teachers on their ability to educate and inform their students. one of the many problems in the education system is Teachers Not caring about how to teach their fellow students.  I respect teachers, and think that they need more funding and bigger annual salaries. So please understand i don't hate teachers, just the ones who don't teach. so please, Change my view.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it could be useful as general feedback, these evaluations would most likely not capture how effective a teacher was, but how happy the teacher made the students.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While not mutually exclusive, I don&amp;#39;t think these are the same things at all.  It would only bias teaching towards even more lax standards (after all, you don&amp;#39;t want to upset students with bad grades).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, your premise is off.  While there are certainly issues that need addressing, most schools aren&amp;#39;t that bad nor is our system on a negative trajectory.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most statistics that try to paint an ugly picture through legerdemain, but in the end, more students are learning more material than they were 75, 50, or even 25 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, much of the troubles are actually due to the home life of the students, and thus is not something that could be directly addressed no matter how good the teachers are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Student evaluations of teachers are still a dangerous proposition. Even though they might help weed out bad teachers, other problems may arise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As others have noticed some teens don&amp;#39;t enjoy school. They may abuse the system and give negative reviews as reprisal for bad grades and not necessarily bad teaching. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is also the problem of grade inflation which may be exacerbated by the course evaluations. For fear of students&amp;#39; complaining and receiving bad course evaluations, some teachers (e.g. a relatively inexperienced teacher) may feel pressured to give higher grades to increase their reputation and increase their chance of a promotion. To this end, a teacher may improve evaluations by modifying their teaching, possibly by &amp;#39;teaching to the test&amp;#39;, or by giving higher than normal grades for assignments and exams or even simply trying to be as entertaining as possible without seriously teaching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
I think SRS is filled with closed-minded people who do not really want to engage in a dialogue with anyone but themselves. CMV.,"I joined SRS because I saw that there was a good deal of racist and sexist comments on reddit and thought that was a forum to discuss said comments in an intelligent and rational manner. Also, as a man, I wanted to educate myself more about feminism by engaging with active and vehement feminists. My very first comment got me banned.  The thread was ""Overly attached Reddit: ""Honestly, if she was overly attached to me I would not mind. Dat body."" [+250].""  I replied to the thread with, ""I don't know if this one is necessarily sexist because a woman could say this about a man. Granted it is in bad taste and reveals how shallow and immature the person commenting is, but is not on par with the other horrible racist/sexist things we constantly see on reddit. Shallow people of any gender can have a judgmental/obsessive attitude about the virtues and desirability of physical beauty.""  I thought that maybe someone on the subreddit would explain to me why this comment was sexist or offensive to women, but instead I was banned. It seems like SRS is intolerant of any viewpoints that deviate even slightly from their own and simply want to shut out or demonize all voices that do not agree with/understand their worldview. This makes SRS just as irrational and devoid of empathy as the groups they constantly rail against. If you can't place yourself in the shoes of someone who doesn't automatically accept your worldview, then you lack empathy. If you then don't even care to engage in a dialogue with this person to show them the error of their ways, you lack rationality and compassion.  As a progressive, I would really like to have my mind changed on this as this has been a rude awakening for me when it comes to feminists.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You were banned because you broke the rules of the subreddit.

CMV: I think spreadsheets should be deprecated and everybody should migrate to embedded databases,"I think the time for the spreadsheet has passed. Spreadsheets was carried over from the time before we we had computers. Then they were called worksheets and accountants used them to their financial based number crunching.  Now a days we have something called SQLite. It is an embedded public domain database engine originally developed to be used on United States destroyers.   The first reason people should migrate to SQLite or another embedded database engine is that you can define relationships between tables. It can be done in spreadsheets but is is very clunky and hard to keep consistent. Databases unlike spreadsheets full  take advantage of computer's power.   The second reason is that more people would have a reason to code. For everyone who wants people to lean to code, here is a viable reason for people to bother doing it. SQL is code people can use to organize and count their items. It would be code that is actually useful to them and not just some boring hobby the government forces them to do in school.  The third reason is that you can link it to other applications. Embedded databases like SQLite can be connected to graphical applications for easier management for some people or command line applications for easier management for other people. The format is open and flexible so it would be more future proof than a common spreadsheet format. Reports can be generated to make more applicable output for another application.  I believe the use of spreadsheets should be deprecated and and that everyone should migrate to embedded databases because they are less clunky, allow a real reason to code, and can link to other applications to produce the reports you want.   *fixed ambiguous capitalization*","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can be done in spreadsheets but is is very clunky and hard to keep consistent.

We will have accountants with no interest in coding that will learn the bare minimum to do what they need. This will result in buggy and inefficient code that may not solve the problem better than a spreadsheet. Programs like Excel are optimized to make common calculations easy and efficient. A database makes you optimize it by yourself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The third reason is that you can link it to other applications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You can do this with spreadsheets.

You use spreadsheets when you have a rough data structure and want to get it done fast. You use databases when you have well-defined data and will do significant amounts of processing on it. A database is overkill for a spreadsheet, and a spreadsheet should not be used as a database.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You are thinking everybody gets coding easily like you, and your solution increases the setup time for common everyday tasks.

"I that if you are sexually assaulted/raped no matter how traumatic it is for you to talk about it, it is your moral obligation to report it to the police ASAP CMV","I frequent a lot of subs that talk about rape and are generally sympathetic to victims of rape. I'm aware that being raped is an awful, traumatic experience, but a lot of the ""support"" that people like to offer victims seems more like pandering to their feelings than addressing the very real crime that occurred. I can sympathize with not being comfortable talking about something traumatic that happened to you, but the fact of the matter is that many rapists are repeat offenders. I often read posts where people decide not to report being raped, but then later decide to after hearing someone else was victimized by the rapist. Many of these cases could be avoided if people would report being raped in the first place.   Doing some quick math from some stats provided by my school paper today, the conviction rate for people accused of criminal sexual conduct is ~23% (which is pretty good when you take into account that it's often a crime that leaves little to no evidence). While I'm sure that's a discouraging number, the more people that come forward about an individual, the higher the chances of them being convicted. I'm sure it's not easy to come forward, but by not doing so you are facilitating another rape committed by the same offender. As members of a community, it's our moral obligation to help protect each other when we can. Not doing so is taking the easy way out that will cause other people's lives to be destroyed as much as yours.  tl;dr Not coming forward to the authorities about your rape facilitates the same person raping other people. No matter how bad/traumatized you feel about it, you have a responsibility to other people in your community to speak up so that they aren't violated in the same way you were.  edit: Just want to clarify before someone brings it up and derails the thread: my argument is talking about the ""right"" thing to do outside of societal perceptions of rape. One's conceptions about whether or not they'll be believed or judged should play no role in their decision to help protect those around them.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would it change your opinion if the statistics were even more skewed than that?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;#39;m pretty sure a lot of people don&amp;#39;t report rape specifically because they (correctly) believe that there is insufficient evidence to convict the rapist. They are likely in a better position to decide that than you are. What if all reporting it would accomplish is for the statistic to become 5% of all rapists being convicted?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Is someone still obligated to report a case that they genuinely don&amp;#39;t think will a) go to trial, or b) result in a conviction?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, you&amp;#39;re discounting the non-trivial number of cases where the victim isn&amp;#39;t even sure at the time whether or not they were raped. That sounds weird, but when you&amp;#39;re talking about situations with consent involved, where consent is far more common than non-consent, and where intoxication is frequently involved, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be that surprising that people are confused at the time, but later clarify their understanding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something I&amp;#39;d like to add to this: coming forward about being raped is most likely, in the end, better for a victim&amp;#39;s emotional stability. I have friends who were victims of sexual assault and never reported it, and I sometimes wonder if they&amp;#39;d be in a better place mentally if they had come forward, or at least sought out psychiatric attention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Something I think is more important than trying to get a rapist convicted, is getting a retraining order (to protect yourself from repeat offense), or simply to report the incident without pressing charges.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a very odd subject, rape, with all of the legal loopholes and frustration revolving around it. Makes me think every good woman should learn to kill people with her bare hands.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;EDIT: word choice, added 2nd paragraph&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: Change the legal definition of birth to when the birth certificate has been filed,"Being born has two meanings: when a child is expelled from the womb and when a new legal entity is recognized by the state.  From http://mhkeehn.tripod.com/births.pdf  &gt; So far our inquiry has established that in modern legal jargon ""birth"" can mean the delivery of a human child, OR the act of bringing into full and complete existence an artificial entity.  Changing the definition of birth and when legal protections apply offers many benefits to parents and the state.  If birth is not recognized until the birth certficate has been filed then parents can decide to discard damaged or unwanted babies which would be a legal abortion instead of an illegal murder.  Fathers could opt out of child support by not signing the birth certicate. The number of single parent households would drop because the baby would not have been born until both parents sign the birth certificate. Until the baby has been born, the birth certificate filed, it would not be a citizen.  Cases of misattributed paternity could be eliminated by requiring a paternity test before the father could sign the birth certificate. Prenatal genetic testing can identify paternity as an incidental finding. Birth certificates would identify the parents of the child and not the people intending to raise it so anonymous sperm and egg donation would be illegal.  Prenatal paternity testing would allow for provisional filing of the legal birth certificate before the baby has been physically born.  Babies that have been physically born but not legally born would be in a legal state similar to cohabiting couples who are not married. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You&amp;#39;re suggesting that we change the very nature of US Citizenship, eliminate the responsibility men have to women when it comes to sex and family, and create the possibility for there to be non-persons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Look, I can guarantee you that some people will be born off grid and might not get a birth certificate registered or the birth certificate could be lost/damaged/misfiled. What then? You say that it&amp;#39;s like cohabitating couples who are not married, but &lt;em&gt;that&amp;#39;s not a legal thing&lt;/em&gt; there are no laws about cohabitating couples nor are there any rights or privileges. You&amp;#39;re saying that we &lt;em&gt;legally ignore these people&lt;/em&gt;. Which means that they fall in the legal category of &amp;quot;resident aliens&amp;quot; not &amp;quot;citizen&amp;quot;. How is that a good thing? How is that a desirable thing? All the rights and privileges of Americans are tied to citizenship or defined by treaty, &lt;em&gt;none of those apply&lt;/em&gt;. How could you possibly be so flippant about things that protect the rest of us from torture and give us the ability to have a say in the political process?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Misattributed paternity isn&amp;#39;t an especially big problem, certainly not one big enough to warrant fundamentally changing the way we do thing to one which apparently &lt;em&gt;assumes&lt;/em&gt; infidelity and misattributed paternity. You&amp;#39;re wasting 90% of the population&amp;#39;s time because nothing occurred to created the situation, and of the 10% not all would care about misattributed paternity. Please don&amp;#39;t change the rules for everyone because you have trust issues.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As far as the father opting out, that brings up a huge problem. What is to stop him from telling her before and during pregnancy that he&amp;#39;s in only to not sign the certificate. The child exist. A living human being is there. Are you suggesting that if the mother was depending upon the father for support and the father abdicates, then we&amp;#39;re just going to kill the infant to cut down on single parent households? I mean, what was the implication I was supposed to get from that statement? You can&amp;#39;t shove the kid back in or abort after birth to get to that &amp;quot;reduced number of single parent households&amp;quot;. The only other option is we bring back massive, state-run orphanages for kids that aren&amp;#39;t even classed as human beings. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Any &amp;quot;moment of truth&amp;quot; that decides the life of the infant in question need to occur before physical birth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would this new legislation benefit the government (particularly) or the general population?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If birth is not recognized until the birth certficate has been filed then parents can decide to discard damaged or unwanted babies which would be a legal abortion instead of an illegal murder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There would be a public outcry at that. Most laws are pretty much designed to prevent or reduce human suffering where possible. As babies can suffer, I can&amp;#39;t see many people considering it morally acceptable to kill them. Plus, if it&amp;#39;s no longer murder, how does this relate to other laws regarding treatment of fellow humans? Can babies be tortured before their birth certificates are signed? Raped? Scarred or mutilated? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To legalise such a thing would pretty much go against the entire reason we have laws. Abortion is already legal in plenty of places (and can be campaigned for if it&amp;#39;s not); if someone does not want a baby, they can have an abortion. If they birth the child and still don&amp;#39;t want it, they can give it up for adoption. With these laws in place, it&amp;#39;s unecessary to kill off unwanted babies and thus nobody would support it or support a government that wanted it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fathers could opt out of child support by not signing the birth certicate. The number of single parent households would drop because the baby would not have been born until both parents sign the birth certificate. Until the baby has been born, the birth certificate filed, it would not be a citizen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m aware that child support laws are debated at the moment, but I&amp;#39;m not going to get into that right now apart from to say this situation would benefit nobody except the few fathers who don&amp;#39;t want to be fathers. Let&amp;#39;s imagine that suddenly a lot of men have a way to not support their children (or vice versa, assuming the mother is also allowed to give up her parental rights in the same way). This then means there&amp;#39;s a lot of single mothers who need more help to raise children. Where are they going to get that help from? The government, because I can&amp;#39;t see developed countries shrugging and saying that children and mothers need to starve on the streets. That means more taxpayer money to support one-parent children. Therefore this is harmful both to the government and the population. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or, to go even further, say that the father agrees to pay child support throughout the pregnancy, but when the baby is born he goes back on this agreement. Let&amp;#39;s assume the mother is also allowed to refuse to sign the birth certificate and now does so because she doesn&amp;#39;t want to be burdened with a child with only her to support it. What happens to be baby now? We&amp;#39;ve already discussed that post-birth abortions aren&amp;#39;t going to happen, so we just have even more children using the taxpayers&amp;#39; money, which - once again - is beneficial to nobody but a very slim minority of parents. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;[Edit: Also, to say &amp;#39;the number of single parent households would drop&amp;#39; is like the police saying &amp;#39;thefts have dropped&amp;#39; because they&amp;#39;ve been calling everything lost property. The babies are still there and still need to be provided for, not recognising them doesn&amp;#39;t change that apart from making the stats misleading.]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cases of misattributed paternity could be eliminated by requiring a paternity test before the father could sign the birth certificate. Prenatal genetic testing can identify paternity as an incidental finding. Birth certificates would identify the parents of the child and not the people intending to raise it so anonymous sperm and egg donation would be illegal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For most people, there&amp;#39;s no need to require anything, so this would just be needless paperwork that would get in the majority&amp;#39;s way, not to mention - once again - expensive to fund. In cases where a paternity test is desired, the parents can already get one without needing all this extra legislation. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, how would this even work? Would there be a time frame to sign the certificate? Could parents keep the kid but kill it off if they got bored after a few years? Could a forgetful parent accidently prevent their kid from becoming a citizen? The whole thing just seems ridiculously impractical to me. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Essentially, this proposal would be very expensive to fund (laws aren&amp;#39;t simple and take a lot of work), is actively harmful to humans and thus immoral, would provide slim-to-no benefits for the majority of people, whilst making them pay for it, and is generally unnecessary considering that abortions are already a thing, as are adoptions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"I don't think that flamboyant, over-the-top behaviour is a real characteristic of homossexuality and people who do that are faking or insecure. CMV","I don't believe that people who act in an extremely gritty, impossible-to-miss way do that BECAUSE of their homosexuality. Being gay doesn't make you put think that everyone should put up with your bad habits, bullshit and childish perception of genre behavior, it makes you love/feel sexual attraction to people of the same sex period.   They are just extremely insecure people who have the need to shove their difference on everyone's faces without actually working on improving their life. We all know gay people suffer prejudice, but even my married gay friends tell me that those people aren't actually gay, but are desperately trying to earn attention by exploiting something that's natural and uneventful, while at the same time bringing shame to gay people who try to live normal lives.  But still I feel like there's something wrong with my view so, please, Clarify my view.   Edit: Took some offensive words out for people who can't handle colloquialisms.  Edit2: Additional information  User u/Bastrd_87 requested me to make some connections with what my view is with what my post addresses.  He said I should provide the reasons why I have the belief that flamboyant people aren't really gay, for that to work I must describe my view of gay people and culture. I would summarize it as  &gt;Homosexuals are people who feel sexual attraction for the same sex for yet to be known reasons (or no reason at all). This behavior gathered the hate of people in many cultures and led to the marginalization of gay folks on post-christian cultures. This led to extreme situations of social anxiety and other things, but [here starts my own vision] after the events of 9/11 and the advent of neo-atheism, influential gay people started campaigning without fear of religious persecution and since they are slowly earning the respect they deserve. The problem is that the Media is a dirty, filthy disgusting business when they want to and they have been cashing in, turning homosexuality into a 'trend', like they could fix decades of blatant, explicit prejudice forcing a detrimental view of the gay culture down everyone's throat. This specially vomit-inducing here in Brazil, but I'll explain further if anyone want to. Now we have people who act gay to earn acceptance they can't through being ''''normal''''. This is pretty much like some fanbases that do more harm than good to something. Gay people are working hard to make an acceptable, stable and respectful image and people who are exploiting the stereotypical concept of gay culture are setting things back for them and should be reprehended. Now, I know there are disgusting heterosexual people too, but since people agreed that heterosexuals are the 'norm' or the 'basic everyday people', they don't have anything to prove to anyone or, given their numerical superiority, should be expected to have shitty people.  That's why I believe flamboyant, attention-seeking people that use their sexuality as a social tool (which is natural for humans but should be avoided now that we have the CIVILIZATION to evade that) do not represent the image that gay people are striving for and serve only to disseminate wrong perceptions of sexuality (like all gay people are futile, vain, oversexualized or promiscuous, deceitful, backstabbing and all that jazz) and should be reprehended and reeducated.  PS: I'm trying to change my view so please please go easy on me, I don't really know if I'm offending anyone but that is NOT my intention in ANY WAY.  Edit:  After reading many insightful and well-written arguments that made me think about how society is built and the dynamic structure of cultures, I finally made my mind.  &gt;In the end, it all comes down to personality and ways of defining one's identity. Annoying people and assholes exist in all cultures and always will but luckily they're stuck being a minority that matter so little they have little power in being detrimental to their group, as people who actually care will focus on the good aspects of people and ostracize assholes not because they are 'flaming faggots', but because they are assholes. It even reaches the zone of mating tools and fitting in in some cases, so even if I can't understand it as acceptable behaviors, I can still recognize it as a gimmick for reaching other who are alike and by the end of the day, people grow out of it.  Some meaningful opinions one should consider are [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i0zds/i_dont_think_that_flamboyant_overthetop_behaviour/cazx780), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i0zds/i_dont_think_that_flamboyant_overthetop_behaviour/cb005e0), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i0zds/i_dont_think_that_flamboyant_overthetop_behaviour/cb00x7k) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i0zds/i_dont_think_that_flamboyant_overthetop_behaviour/cazx7qm).

CMV: Cheerleading is not a sport,"I need to preface my thoughts initially by saying that holding this view does not mean I devalue cheerleading in any way. I have attended competitions, and known several friends who cheerlead, and though I am a very active, physically fit person, I would still find it challenging to learn and execute many moves in cheerleading, and find it impressive and enjoyable to watch.  However, I don't consider it a sport. This is not a pejorative assertion, but even so, I have experienced pushback for it in the past. I also don't subscribe to the Olympic definition of sport. In my view, a sport needs to be able to be won by objective means. That is to say, you need to have a goal that can be reached: make it to a certain point first, score more points, lift the most weight, etc. Obviously, officials make wrong calls, and goals in hockey/soccer for instance are wrongly disallowed/wrongly given occasionally, but at the end of the day, there is still an objective result/outcome, but for the number of games they decide on the merit of the mistake alone, I'm willing to consider them a reasonable minority. Team A 4 - 3 Team B, Usain Bolt wins race with time of 9.68 seconds, etc. I believe events decided solely by judges cannot be sports, and will always be subjective in nature. Sports like boxing, with judging elements, are still sports in my view because there is an objective way to win - knocking the opponent out so they cannot respond to a 10 count, for instance. The judging is a tiebreaker, and I am fine with that. But in judge-only events, an identical routine could win one contest, and lose another, simply by virtue of human subjectivity alone. For this reason, I lump cheerleading in with figure skating, diving, and other events as athletic activities.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I think that diamond engagement rings are a sham. CMV,"First off, a bit about me. I'm a young male, I don't want to get married yet, but would like to some day. I also don't want a big wedding, or to have children, so I guess you could say that i'm not very traditional. I have no problem buying a plain ring or a ring with an alternative to diamonds, as long as it's under a couple of hundred euros.  The main reason I don't want to buy an engagement ring is money. They are ridiculusly overpriced. I'm not willing to pay a couple of grand for a shiny rock. I think the money could be much better spent on a a great holiday, or to help start your married life together.   Also, I think that diamonds are a sham. They aren't rare, they are just strategically kept out of the market. I think that people are brainwashed into thinking that this is a symbol of love. That your prospective life partner doesn't think you're worth it, if they don't buy you a shiny rock. This materialistic urge that is drilled into people fom a young age, by people who stand to profit from it, is something I don't buy into, and don't want to comply with or encourage.   I want my view changed because all the women in my family disagree with me, and i'm  worried about it leading to relationship problems down the line.  Edit: My view has been partially changed in some ways. I can now see some merit in certain people buying diamonds. Alas my core beliefs on the subject stil hold firm. Thank you to everyone who commented. I didn't expect this to get as much attention as it had and i've thuroughly enjoyed this discussion.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I never thought I wanted a diamond engagement ring. When my then-girlfriend was considered proposing, she asked me what I wanted and what I cared about. The proposal itself had been expected, but I told her at the time I didn&amp;#39;t know what I wanted and would need some time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She hated the idea of me not having something &amp;#39;concrete&amp;#39;, so we spent some time shopping around and finally found a Swarovski ring with the features that I liked. It cost us around 150USD, and I wear it everyday. It&amp;#39;s much brighter than the diamond jewelry that I own, which were handmedowns from my mother. The problem is, even though it&amp;#39;s brighter, it is not intended for everyday wear the same way a traditional diamond ring is. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Engagement and wedding rings, by their very nature, are crafted to be durable and beautiful at the same time. My mother&amp;#39;s wedding set was worn every day for 35 years before she passed away, and the ring itself was never dented or dinged. My ring, in comparison, shows obvious wear: the coating has chipped on the bottom from where it scratches against various surfaces, the small jewels on the band have fallen out (they&amp;#39;ve been replaced now, thankfully), and I have to polish it more often to retain the sparkle. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While the concept of a diamond ring as a necessary gift for an engagement was certainly engineered by DeBeers as a marketing campaign, there&amp;#39;s nothing &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; with wanting a ring.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For me, a diamond ring is a tasteful, tangible way to display my love for my partner (and theirs for me). While I personally wouldn&amp;#39;t opt for a larger than life multi-carat ring, I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s anything wrong with someone whose taste leads them in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I do buy a ring, I know I&amp;#39;ll buy a diamond ring. I won&amp;#39;t be thrilled about the cost, but I also wasn&amp;#39;t thrilled about buying a new car, or the cost to move across the country. But I know that every day that I look at it, I&amp;#39;ll be reminded of the love and sacrifice my SO and I shared, and I won&amp;#39;t regret it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much the way I thought for a long time until I got my fiancée an engagement ring.  After doing lots of research I am extremely happy with my purchase of a diamond engagement ring.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why to buy a diamond&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1)  The cartel has broken.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You expressed some concern saying “I think that diamonds are a sham. They aren&amp;#39;t rare, they are just strategically kept out of the market.”  While that still is true to a certain extent the big cartel player (De Beers) has finally been broken.  In 2000 producers in Russia, Canada and Australia decided to cut off channels to De Beers due to the negative publicity of “blood diamonds”  and De Beers has been losing market share.  De Beers’ market share fell from as high as 90% in the 1980s to less than 40% in 2012.  In 2011 the Oppenheimer family announced their intention to sell the entirety of their 40% share.  Price manipulation is now far more difficult. You could argue at this point in 2013, there is no manipulation and it is simply the market. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2)  You’re not buying the rough diamond, you’re buying the art.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Diamonds are expensive.  I mean wtf they are just shiny hard pieces of carbon, I mean hell so is my ass.  So why are they so expensive?  It’s because of the art and skill it takes to cut a polish a rough diamond.  These are skilled professionals who take years of training and experience to cut a rough diamond and actually make it look fantastic.  Cut, the most important quality in my opinion, is almost entirely dependent on the skill of the diamond cutter.  And even the carat is dependent on the diamond cutter not cutting too much.  What this means of course is no diamond is the same.  That may sound lame but it’s true.  Small differences in facet pattern can produce large differences in the pattern of light that is reflected off the stone.  Every diamond has its own “fire and brilliance” pattern.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3)  The expense per day of use is very small.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But diamonds are still expensive.  I spent around $5000 for my engagement ring I gave to my fiancée, a lot right now, but she wears it every. single. day.  And if we stay together for 50 years (perfectly reasonable considering our age) this means that the per day usage is $0.27!   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4)  There are alternatives to mined diamonds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now you still may not like a mined diamond who knows maybe the store or website is lying and it is a blood diamond.  I considered buying a synthetic diamond from a place like &lt;a href=""http://gemesis.com/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  They use large pressure cookers to form real diamonds which are a little less expensive.  I didn’t buy from them because they didn’t have the shape and style I was looking for and they aren’t that great at producing pure colorless yet.  But they appear to be getting better and better.  Of course they are about the same price for freaking carbon, but that’s because these diamonds still need to be cut by the same artists who cut earth-grown diamonds.  Furthermore you could argue that the technology needed to make these is an art in itself.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;5)  You get enjoyment researching and every day she wears it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally it was fun looking all this up knowing that she will wear what I pick every single day.  Sometimes I see the sparkle of the facet pattern when we are out at a restaurant and think of how I may know the facet pattern better than she does; I know why I chose a “modified brilliant cut” over an “old mine cut” and how it suits her and her personality.  Sometimes while driving her I see some shimmer on the celling of the car and think about what that means; this stone, this diamond, on my fiancée’s finger, grew in the earth for perhaps millions of years at 1800 degrees to one day be blasted out of the earth through a volcano, to then be found, mined, cut, polished and finally purchased by me and given to my fiancée.  Sometimes while on the couch with her, I see some reflection on the wall and I think of the sacrifice it took to mine, produce, and ship and the cost to me and I think that she is worth it.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You get to be reminded almost every day what this person means to you and at $0.27 a day it’s a steal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: I believe that the majority of examinations used in schools are ineffective at determining knowledge.,"I believe that in the majority of cases, final examinations in college (and even more in high school) are are ineffective at helping students learn and preparing them for the real world.   With the obvious exception of jobs which require constant in depth attention and quick decision making (surgeons for example), determination of how much a person knows through an exam lasting for a few hours, inside a room filled with countless other individuals, is an inadequate determination of knowledge. Since the invention of the internet, many of the questions that we test become obsolete. For high school exams, memorizing specific dates, names, functions etc. are fairly pointless when you could look it up in 5 seconds. Even in university, when writing essays becomes common, producing an analysis of passages in such a short time and stressful environment is not an indication many times of how much one knows, but often how much they have memorized what is mentioned in class. In particular, computer science exams, consisting of writing programs with no aid, is extremely ineffective and does not examine how much one actually knows of a subject.  I believe a much better assessment would be through the use of final assignments, where students have a larger time in a less stressful environment. This allows access to all resources they would have in a job, and allows for teachers to provide them with much more difficult and interesting problems than could be provided on a short exam. While it is true that there would be the tendency to copy other students, such students likely will not make it into the job world simply relying on others. If anything, with less stress placed upon a single exam, there would not be the same pressure gradewise.  Change my view.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I am never stressed in a test, but often get extremely anxious and extremely stressed over projects. In these projects I often don&amp;#39;t preform to my top measure because of this stress, but during a test I do preform my best.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;d also argue that most jobs are more test based.

"CMV: Concerning promotions, pandering to bosses is more effective than being a hard, efficient worker who cares about the job.","I work for a medium-sized service company, and see people who ""suck up"" to our bosses receiving raises and promotions, and being groomed for higher positions. Some individuals don't do much work at all, but when middle management comes to supervise, these people act absurdly happy to see them and are eager to agree with all of the managers' ideas. To me, this seems hypocritical and unethical.  Meanwhile, I have been working at this job for a year now (I'm the 5th most senior employee out of 35 - there's a lot of turnover) and have put my heart into developing the craft, doing it faster and more efficiently every day, and delivering the best possible product to our guests. But if a manager comes around, I pretty much treat them the same way as I would any other human being. I care about them, but I'm never going to kiss someone's ass or agree to do something that seems backwards, or just ethically wrong, without at least asking why. My managers overlook how much I help the company and how loyal I am to them, and basically treat me like a delinquent because, to them, I ""talk back"" too much. I feel like I deserve a lot more respect than that, considering that I'm the very lowest paid employee, and at the same time one of the most effective.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Just because someone is a hard efficient worker who cares doesn&amp;#39;t mean they could be put out of the running for all kinds of reasons...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Consider, this stuff is subjective: if your vision for the company doesn&amp;#39;t align with your superiors, then maybe in their eyes you aren&amp;#39;t the &amp;#39;most effective&amp;#39; employee at all... you say you&amp;#39;re efficient and care about your job, but maybe you just care differently. Which is okay! But if your vision of the best possible product isn&amp;#39;t theirs, then how can you say that you&amp;#39;re the best employee? Does that make sense? So perhaps &amp;#39;pandering&amp;#39; isn&amp;#39;t the issue, it seems like the issue could be that you have different ideas, and they don&amp;#39;t like them. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In my experience personality and how you &amp;#39;come off&amp;#39; to people is an important part of getting a promotion, but I don&amp;#39;t necessarily think that means pandering is more effective. You can be a hard efficient worker who cares about the job and also doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;talk back&amp;quot; or does it in a different way. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working hard and connecting with your boss aren&amp;#39;t mutually exclusive.  I wouldn&amp;#39;t put a substantial amount of stock in personal observations of one employee who considers himself to be a disproportionately hard worker when it comes to grading those he works with.  Nothing personal; it&amp;#39;s just easy to think we work harder than everybody else because it&amp;#39;s us and we are well aware of the large efforts we put into things.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Moreover, I think it&amp;#39;s unfair to count this as &amp;#39;pandering.&amp;#39;  Part of working at a firm means working well with others, being personable, and willing to communicate.  People who dialogue with the boss are probably standing out not only by having simply spoken up, but by illustrating that they can handle the people-aspect of a job - including people they work with if your firm isn&amp;#39;t client-based - as much as the technical and practical aspect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I see nothing wrong or immoral with having to pay for healthcare. CMV,"Now obviously I don't agree with the super high price inflation that most US citizens are subjected to but I do believe that the idea of paying for healthcare is completely normal.

Also, I want to pay for my healthcare and my healthcare only. I would rather bite the bullet paying for care when I need it than having huge increases in taxes to pay for everyone else's. However, I have heard good things from the other side, that a universal healthcare system does work but I have trouble believing that it is any better than paying for my own.

CMV: Washington DC should receive full representation in Congress.,"So I have lived in DC for my entire life. Here we don't get any representation in the Senate, and we only have one non-voting house member. DC has more residents than some states, yet here we are.  For a long time, I didn't care, I don't vote often anyway. But what really catilized me, was [this](http://www.thepeoplesvoice.org/TPV3/Voices.php/2015/02/26/feds-threats-to-dc-over-legal-pot-why-do). Why DC residents voted by referendum to legalize pot, not only did Congress threaten to block it, ~~Congress~~ a congressman threatened to have our democratically elected mayor imprisoned, for following the will of her constituents.  I'm sure people will say that DC should be reabsorbed by Maryland. There are three reasons this is impractical.  1. Maryland republicans would not even want DC. It would dramatically shift the political spectrum. 2. It would mean that Dc wasn't really getting representation in the Senate, because our votes for senators would be negligable. 3. Thousands of people in the city government would be out of a job, in a city already suffering severe unemployment.  I look forward to being convinced.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"CMV:In vitro fertilization/assisted reproduction in general is irksome to me. Being that so many children are without parents, I don't get why adoption isn't a viable choice for those couples who cannot conceive without assisted reproductive technologies.","I personally do not understand the value in spending in the tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars on IVF, surrogacy, etc. to facilitate having a child with your genes when there are so many children throughout the entire world deprived of a family and in need of adoption. What is it about YOUR genes that is so special? It's not just a couple of rounds of IVF in a 30-something patient who is having trouble conceiving that bothers me the most, but I guess the more complicated/expensive it becomes the more frustrated I get with the concept. For example, having brothers or sisters donating gametes if yours do not work due to age or medical issue/if you're a homosexual couple in need of gametes from the opposite gender. If your motivation stems purely from the sense of purpose that parenthood would bring, then why does it matter what the child's exact genome is? I understand that this might be touchy, especially in the homosexual community for which assisted reproductive technology is the only way of bearing children of your own genetic lineage, but I guess I don't understand why this should be a right, and something that needs to be facilitated if it is not ""naturally"" possible. I realize my feelings about this are purely feelings, and I'd never want anything written into law banning these procedures - I realize this would ostracize entire communities. But it really bothers me that people would turn to this instead of to adoption. Would you really love a child with your genes more than an adopted child? Privilege check: I'm posting this as someone who would most likely be able to reproduce without such assistance, but if it turned out that I couldn't and I was at a place in life where I wanted to be a parent, I'm pretty sure I'd choose adoption over anything more ""complicated."" Please change my view! I'd particularly like to hear from parents who have chosen to conceive via IVF, surrogacy, etc. Please know I respect your decision and am happy for all children raised by loving parents, and I think this should remain a legal possibility, but to be honest I have a personal bias and would like that to be changed.    _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV: Politicians should be unable to change their (public) views while in office.,"I think that in order to have any fruitful exchange of ideas people should be openminded and willing to accept that they might be wrong. That is why I would love to change my view that politcians should not change their views.   The reason that I think they should stay the same is that the people that elect them elect politicians based on their views. And when the politician changes their views after being elected then it's unfair to the voters, because the simple fact that a politicians view changes doesn't mean that the minds of the people who voted for him do.   A politician could still change his views in private, but would be required to advocate the views he had when he was voted into office, even if he no longer holds those views. The only moment he could change his views would be during elections, as then the people can vote about it.    _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

So if you believe the politician should represent the views of the people, they would need to change their view if the people do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t really make sense though because many people are elected whose views are different than the majority of people they represent. It&amp;#39;s common for an elected official to vote against the views of the majority of their constituents.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are also instances where the views of the people are the result of misinformation. It&amp;#39;s easier to change the view of a single politician than an entire population.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, when we elect someone, that comes with no guarantee how they will vote. Therefore politicians should be able to change their view while in office.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the problems I see with this is that if you asked 10 different people who voted for Candidate Martinez what Candidate Martinez&amp;#39;s views even are, you&amp;#39;d probably get 10 different answers.

CMV: The majority of the world's international issues could be curbed or solved by population control.,"Okay, so I have had this theory building up over the last ten years or so as I have been going through school and getting degrees in different areas. I can go to school for free and I like to learn. I've studied history, ecology, politics, health and public safety, art and psychology. I'm by no means an expert in any of them but I'm well-versed enough to talk about all of them.  I've seen a trend that in every field, the general stressor or causal issue in each is overpopulation. The exponential growth of the human race causes structural failure in on a local, regional, national and global scale. The only way to begin the trend back towards a sustainable global environment is for people to just stop having children.  Below are the top five global issues listed as worries for Europeans from a poll taken in 2011. I couldn't find an updated one for the US that I trusted. With them I've laid out the **very very very light** framework of how population control could benefit. No deep details, just an overview of my opinion.  **Global Warming/Ecological Impact:** Love it or hate it, humans take a major toll on natural resources without heeding the impact it takes on the earth as a complete system. If there was a concerted effort to keep the population from growing for even a decade, or indefinitely limiting the number of offspring allowed to be born, it would curb the toll taken on natural resources as well as lessen the footprint we're leaving as a species. On top of that, the industrial complex that is needed to support a growing population must continually make riskier and riskier decisions on how to keep they supply meeting demand. This means rather than dumping their waste in a safe place, it's going to rivers and oceans so that they can keep production up. Rather than finding sustainable ways to transport goods, their profits are going toward scaling the business rather than researching sustainability.    **War:** I could go on and on about this one but here's the finer points. Since the beginning of man, war has been over one thing: **resources**. Every good politician finds a way to make war about something else; be it justice, national security or what have you. But in the end it's resources. Iraq=Oil. Civil War=Cheap Slave Labor. Iraq invading Kuwait=Oil. WWII=Iron, Oil and Land. Point being, if there was a lowered strain on the global market to provide enough supply to meet a burgeoning demand, there would be less need for conflict. Additionally, if there were lower populations in countries struggling to stay afloat, it would take less resources to stabilize the economy.  **Global Energy Crisis/Food Shortage:** See above entry on War.   **Epidemic Disease:** With a growing population and a limited amount of space, the chances of falling prey to an epidemic disease grow daily just based upon the fact that as the continue to grow the space between each human continues to decrease. Mathematically, there will come a time when humans will grow in number to a point that we are literally living on top of each other and spreading disease will become inevitable. Look at lower income areas of many large Asian cities: people are just stacked upon each other. Population control would move that trend in the opposite direction. As the elderly die off and fewer newborn children are introduced into the world, the space per human would continue to grow.   **Psychological Issues:** Overpopulation is a psychological stressor. The idea that everyday there are hundreds or thousands of young people entering the workforce who are vying for your job, waiting for you to retire or die so that they can take your place causes stress. Same goes for your food, your home or your spouse or partner. You don't have to be a PhD to realize that every day there are more people vying for the same resources you require to survive. You see it when you fill up your car, or wait in line at the grocery store or watch the news and see reporting on wars fought over land or oil. In the back of your mind, you can't help but imagine a world where someone is coming to take your shit by force. That's a stressor. On a daily basis it's probably not going to affect you much, but add that effect up over years or decades and it's a BIG worry. Every time you hear about a junkie looking for a fix committing a burglary, you're not thinking that some poor guy got his shit stolen. You're thinking ""That could be me. Someone could be coming for my shit next."" *The majority of crimes in America are property crimes. Because there are limited resources that people want and a growing number of people.*  What you'll notice about every single one of these issues comes down to one thing: resources. Be it land, space, food, healthcare, there's only so much of each commodity left on this planet and a growing need to distribute it to more people. Mathematically, we cannot sustain growth like this for more than a generation or two. If we don't run out of resources first, we'll end up killing everyone for the ones that are left.   And last but not least, I'd like to point out the futility of my own viewpoint here. Politics will not ever allow for measures to be put into place that would enforce something like what I'm proposing. American politicians refuse to touch this topic with a ten foot pole because their goal is to stay in office as long as possible and telling people to stop fucking is not the way to do that. Factor in the bible thumping campaign donors and it's all over. Even if there was legislation passed tomorrow, it would take a generation to even notice the difference. Then factor in the economic shock of changing from an economy driven by consumption to one that only produces what's needed and we're looking at a global depression.   And that's all I have to say about that.    ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have had this theory building up over the last ten years or so as I have been going through school and getting degrees in different areas...

I&amp;#39;m by no means an expert in any of them but I&amp;#39;m well-versed enough to talk about all of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just a side note, but this isn&amp;#39;t important at all. If you&amp;#39;re educated enough on the subjects then it&amp;#39;ll show. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#39;d like to point out that human beings themselves &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a resource. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how big your iron mine is if you don&amp;#39;t have any miners. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how poor you are if you can convince enough people to join you and overthrow the bourgeoisie. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how much farmland you have if you don&amp;#39;t have farmers to farm. People aren&amp;#39;t simply rivals in a zero-sum game, they&amp;#39;re potential trading partners and allies. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is why some of your arguments don&amp;#39;t make sense from an economic perspective. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea that everyday there are hundreds or thousands of young people entering the workforce who are vying for your job, waiting for you to retire or die so that they can take your place causes stress. Same goes for your food, your home or your spouse or partner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If there are less people, there are fewer companies to work for. There are smaller companies. There are fewer positions to fill. If there are less people, there are less potential spouses to look for. There are fewer farmers. There are fewer cities and fewer homes. When the population grows, then all of these things increase in scale. Supply and demand. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From a species-wide perspective, diversity is a fantastic thing. The best way to have diversity is to have more of us. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The more people we produce, the more genius scientists, engineers and political leaders we produce. We get a better chance of solving the problems we are presented with because of the human capital we now have. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mathematically, there will come a time when humans will grow in number to a point that we are literally living on top of each other and spreading disease will become inevitable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Disease has &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; been inevitable. However, the more variety of human there is, the better chance we have at surviving any given catastrophe. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of man, war has been over one thing: resources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This kind of seems like you argued against your own thesis. There have been significantly fewer humans in the past than there are now, but we still managed to fight over scarce resources. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also argue specifically against your oversimplification of war. Wars have many dynamics. War is about resources, sure. War is also about politics. War is about ideological conflict. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard the central problem in economics defined as that there is a theoretically boundless demand for finite resources. That doesn&amp;#39;t go away no matter how many people you have competing against each other. If half the people in the world in the world right now died immediately, then instead of trying to divide our oil resources by 7 billion we&amp;#39;d be driving SUVs with wild abandon and dividing our oil resources by 3 billion. We&amp;#39;d still have conflict if Saudi Arabia decided to stop selling oil to the United States. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course there are upper bounds to population. There is a certain number of humans that the earth literally cannot sustain. We cannot have 1.989E30 kg of humans or else we would be crushed under our own weight and form a star (right? not an astronomer). However, population growth in most cases naturally levels off at a sustainable level, and we aren&amp;#39;t anywhere close to as desperate a situation as you described. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There still might be some cases where population control might solve a problem in the world. But you&amp;#39;d have to admit that &amp;quot;the &lt;strong&gt;majority&lt;/strong&gt; of the world&amp;#39;s international issues could be curbed or solved by population control&amp;quot; is a bit much. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s a very simplistic idea that solving our issues comes down to having a smaller population. Most of our issues in the modern world are very multi-dimensional, and population is but a single factor. Pair that with the fact that &lt;a href=""http://www.globalissues.org/article/26/poverty-facts-and-stats""&gt;most people in the world live in some kind of poverty&lt;/a&gt;, and the&lt;a href=""http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/fact-sheet-world-population.aspx""&gt; global population trend shows that there&amp;#39;s more people in underdeveloped nations than first world countries&lt;/a&gt;, and I don&amp;#39;t think your solution would be the perfect answer you think it is. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr/&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;As direct responses to your categories, however:&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Global Warming/Ecological Impact:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The fact that most of the world is not highly developed shows that a lot of this pollution comes not from a bigger population, but from more developed regions with higher population density. There are plenty of ways to cut down on pollution without necessarily reducing population size. There are pushes for green energy, more efficient technologies, tighter regulations on corporate environmental practices, pushes for recycling, mass transit and carpooling, electric cars, etc... By reducing the population, you might potentially slow the rate of development, but the issue of global warming is a cumulative effect of emissions over time. We&amp;#39;d still have to deal with the environmental changes, but perhaps we&amp;#39;d have more time to deal with it. That&amp;#39;s more a bandaid fix than a solution outright. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Global Energy/Food Shortage:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In terms of energy production and food supplies... we actually aren&amp;#39;t doing that bad in the world. The only issue is that &lt;a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/19/global-wealth-oxfam-inequality-davos-economic-summit-switzerland""&gt;developed nations hoard their resources&lt;/a&gt;, leading to starvation in regions like Africa and much of Asia. There was a great post over on &lt;a href=""/r/theydidthemath""&gt;/r/theydidthemath&lt;/a&gt;; and an &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/2qzts1/request_how_much_money_would_it_cost_the_citizens/cnb3apd""&gt;amazing comment&lt;/a&gt; which calculated that first world countries only make up about 12% of the population, and even still it would only cost us 9¢ a day to end world hunger, or less than 5% of the United States annual military spending.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the energy part of this equation, we already have limitless resources for power (e.g. the sun, hydroelectrics, wind farms, etc...) we just need more pushes to actually pursue this technology, which is not going to make OPEC happy, but they do not represent the best interests of humanity in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;War:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Reducing population isn&amp;#39;t going to end violence or war any time soon. We&amp;#39;ve had wars throughout the history of humanity, even when the distances were great between peoples. Population may increase the relative stress of resource distribution, but with how technology has offset that process, it really comes down to violence, diplomacy, and greed. And as above with the effects of global warming; we&amp;#39;re going to use up our resources eventually. The issue is not to try and slow the bleed, it&amp;#39;s to explore other options to keep our growth sustainable. Looking towards alternative materials, recycling, asteroid mining, etc...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Epidemic:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re already pursuing herd immunity and we&amp;#39;ve been able to destroy diseases like small pox in the past. Despite what the crazy anti-vaxxers might try to tell you, vaccinations are protecting our population from outbreaks. That said, increased population is a concern, but only if the health standards are affected by this increase in population. If living in sanitary conditions, the number of people is less important that the treatment received for illness. And, with the interconnection of the world, while you may reduce the overall population, the requirement for corporations, businesses, and interaction would lead to greater contact overall. The greatest threat in terms of epidemic and pandemic really is transportation, and how these diseases can ride on ships, planes, and trains to spread themselves rapidly. Population is only one factor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Psychological issues:&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While there may be some stress from living in a big city, I don&amp;#39;t think you can attribute all mental health issues, or indeed most, just to population side. Setting aside the fact that there are plenty of extroverts who would thrive in a more populous region, those who are under stresses that lead to depression and other mental illness are often driven there not by the number of people around them, but by the societal pressures that population brings. Competing for jobs, dealing with negative advertisements and peer pressure, feeling threatened by certain people, trying to support ones self. It&amp;#39;s more about quality than quantity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: Sex is something intimate, to be shared in a relationship; not just something that should be done casually.","I was raised to believe that sex is an intimate part of a relationship that is meant to be a bonding experience between lovers, as well as, duh, pleasurable. But, it's been a while since I've had any prospects  for a relationship (and, thus, it's been a while since I've had sex). It's been long enough that I've contemplated having casual sex (either with a friend, or with just random people), and doing it solo just isn't cutting it anymore. But whenever I've come close or had an offer I get...anxious. I start to feel guilty and embarrassed, and end up declining. But I'm having this internal struggle about my feelings on casual sex. However, I don't look down on people that do have casual sex, it just doesn't click for me on an emotional level.  I hope this is enough information about my view, I'll answer any extra questions just in case I missed something!  **Tl;dr**: Reddit, change my view on casual sex so I can have ""relations"" without feeling awful about myself. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Okay, here&amp;#39;s my two cents:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If casual sex is not your thing, I don&amp;#39;t see why you should psych yourself into it. First of all, there&amp;#39;s a chance you&amp;#39;ll change your mind again right after the deed is done, and now you&amp;#39;ve dragged someone into your troubles. There&amp;#39;s also the inherent risks of a partner who could turn against your consent, or simple accidents like broken condoms. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My vote would be this. Someone you know and trust cuts down on some of these risks, and you&amp;#39;re more likely to receive understanding if you freak out after he sex. Alternatively, you may actually really like it and now you have a partner for it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;d like to nix your casual stranger sex option off the table and instead, look for a nice solid lover/FWB.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now the real reason for commenting: I&amp;#39;d like to commend you for posting here on CMV looking to actually change your view.

Logically, it&amp;#39;s pleasurable to both parties, if both parties are consenting to provide pleasure for the other, then there&amp;#39;s no reason that it&amp;#39;s immoral.

"CMV: Can someone have multiple genders, or no gender at all?","Hi there. So, I recently came out as bi-gender to my boyfriend. As it turns out, he doesn't think that really exists. He is of the opinion that someone can't have multiple genders (or no gender at all, for that matter).   I've used every argument I could think of, even saying it could be considered a mild form of schizophrenia. His only argument has been that it just doesn't make sense to him. Even saying it doesn't always make sense to me didn't help.   Despite this, he's been asking what I want to be called and such. Since I don't need any changes to be comfortable, I've asked him repeatedly to forget it, but he won't. At this point it may be easiest if you convince me I'm wrong.

Like heads or tails, or even a value in between. But what does it mean to have multiple genders? We all have attributes of various genders, which are the social norms of our culture.

CMV: Transgender people should NOT be able to use the bathroom of their OPPOSITE BIOLOGICAL sex,"We were having a debate about it in class and my teacher brought up this case in America where transgender students were able to use the bathroom of the opposite biological sex. (http://dailycaller.com/2013/08/12/calif-governor-signs-transgender-students-rights-bill/) I found this utterly uncomfortable. I do not think people who value their privacy among members of the opposite sex should have to change their habits to a very small minority. As a dude, specifically a teenager, I would find the idea of girls coming into a place where I can feel comfortable about my body with the same sex (not meant to sound homosexual) be intruded by women. Specifically change rooms, I would feel quite violated with women/girls around. People in my class thought it was insensitive but why should I have to conform to a extremely small minority? Please CMV  ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;People do their thing in cubicles, the shape of their plumbing doesn&amp;#39;t really matter. I would support unisex toilets, I don&amp;#39;t give a shit if people of other genders see how I wash my hands. As long as the distinction remains, transgenders and transvestites ought to use the bathroom of the sex they present themselves as.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, trans men are men. Whether or not you want to share a bathroom, it is generally considered a bare-minimum to refer to people&amp;#39;s gender as they wish for it to be referred to. This isn&amp;#39;t girls wanting to use the men&amp;#39;s bathroom, this is boys and men who want to use the men&amp;#39;s bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Secondly... Okay. Bathrooms in general, nobody&amp;#39;s looking at each other&amp;#39;s private parts. There are stalls, in well designed bathrooms there are barriers between urinals, basically it just doesn&amp;#39;t even matter what bits someone has.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; of distress you experience at having trans people in change rooms with you... I&amp;#39;m sorry, but it really is fucking nothing compared to the distress caused by not being recognized as the gender one is. Like, occasionally you get a little uncomfortable, and then go about your day. But a trans person risks violence, verbal abuse, social isolation, work discrimination, etc. And then at the end of the day, they&amp;#39;re put through the humiliation of having to use the bathroom of the opposite gender? I&amp;#39;m sorry, but your discomfort is nothing compared to theirs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, if it&amp;#39;s such a tiny minority it&amp;#39;ll hardly ever happen to you, right? So what&amp;#39;s the issue?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve got every right to have your own boundaries and everything, but so does everyone else. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I believe free solo climbing is just incredibly foolish and the people who do it do not appreciate life as much as they should. CMV,"Let me start by explaining what free solo climbing is to those who are not familiar with it. It is an activity in which you climb without a harness or rope. That is, without any safety precautions what so ever. The routes that are climbed are anything from 15 meters to over 500. The most common reasons I've heard for which this is practised is the need for adrenaline, new perspective on the world and yourself, and the need to find new challenges or to do what no one else has ever done. I simply do not understand understand these arguments. In a world as big as ours, a person can spend his whole life travelling and still not be able to see and do everything. How can one not find a way to challenge him/herself without running such an incredibly huge life threatening risk? It feels like these individuals are more in love with the fact of being so near death than anything else, which is why I believe they do not appreciate life as much as a person should. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I climb.  I have climbed for 25 years.  I have &amp;quot;soloed&amp;quot; rock climbs, ice climbs, big mountains, small mountains and scrambled about on my own or with friends on just about everything in between.  I also believe I appreciate life and all its blessings to its fullest so I feel that my experience is somewhat valid at least to me.  I might not change your view, but at least I might be able to explain why I challenge myself by apparently risking life and limb just to get a quick adrenalin fix.  Its about passion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;How can one not find a way to challenge him/herself without running such an incredibly huge life threatening risk? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well there are lots of ways to challenge your self, but when it boils down to it, its how you perceive challenge. You could, as you suggest do a bit of traveling.  OK, I have done a bit of traveling.  I have driven round Africa twice, driven London to Cape Town a few times as a job and spent 10 years running expeditions in the Sahara.  Travel is nice, but bar sorting out the finance and the time to do it, I don&amp;#39;t find it very challenging really. its just kinda fun.  So I take travel to the next level, increase the risk / discomfort and decide to kite buggy for 500 miles across the Mauritanian Sahara on my own.  Ok that was fun for 10 days but being honest it was a bit boring really and very grueling really. And hot. very, very hot.  So where next? - bit of ski touring on my own in Greenland?  Some sort of survival challenge out in the African bush?  Its getting a bit risky now.  You might die doing this stuff. My point here is that with out some sort of risk, any challenge in the venture in question is artificial at best.  I just don&amp;#39;t get the mental pay back that makes the effort worth it if the challenge is risk free. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So to solo climbing.  There is risk.  It could be a big risk if your pushing your limits or as safe as driving to the shops if your not.  Actually driving to the shops I would argue is inherently more dangerous than soloing a route at 75% of your ability.  I have lost more friends to car accidents than I have climbing over the years -  driving is scary stuff, you just don&amp;#39;t view it like that as you drive all the time.  Your complacency to the risk you are taking has lessened the impact of the challenge of surviving the drive.  If you want a driving type experience that is more akin to the freedom of soloing a big mountain route - buy a push bike.  The problem with this is that the objective dangers of biking are seriously stacked against you.  Push bikes are very, very dangerous.  Cars and trucks will try and kill you. That&amp;#39;s scary.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If I scare myself out climbing, I appreciate what I have in life very, very intensely.  I feel a close connection with the some what tenuous link I share with modern life.  I&amp;#39;m not in love with near death experiences -  I try and avoid those on the whole.  I&amp;#39;m in love with the feeling of being in control of my own destiny and the the feeling that adrenalin gives you which makes you feel more alive and sharpens your senses.  It makes me appreciate what I have have in life and concentrates my attention in an extremely &amp;quot;zen&amp;quot; like way.  This is one of the many reasons I climb. It makes me feel good. It relaxes me in a way that no other experience I have ever had does.  There are many other reasons why I climb such as a profound love of the outdoors through to goal orientated achievement and physical exertion but for me the feeling &amp;quot;feeling alive&amp;quot; bit is the most important.  In order to get this feeling I have to mentally and physically tax myself. I can (and have done) this in a variety of environments (I have been involved in most &amp;quot;adrenalin sports&amp;quot; to quite a high level at some point)  but for me the most pleasurable is up in the mountains or out in a desert somewhere. (I&amp;#39;m sure there is a reason why God lives out in the desert for three of the worlds major religions and up in the mountains for the other two.) I can climb something on a rope with some mates that&amp;#39;s extremely physically challenging that pushes me beyond my comfort zone or I can plod up say an ice route on my own, pleasing my self in a purely selfish way, knowing that for me either act will put all those everyday things that most people see as challenges back in their place.  I just can&amp;#39;t get very excited about mundane stuff like making money or paying bills or buying potatoes from the shop. That stuff doesn&amp;#39;t make me appreciate what I have - it just makes me realise I need more crap in my life.  For me this is a little depressing.  Unfortunately the &amp;quot;challenge&amp;quot; of say pushing a watermelon 2000km with your nose seems equally pointless and mundane too.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I truly believe that if you don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; this point of view, you never will.  You just don&amp;#39;t have that bit in side you that feeds on a passion for life so strong you have to satisfy it.  You will be happy with what you do - in the same way that I am am with what I do.  I will never understand what makes you tick in the same way you will never understand what goes on in my head.  I don&amp;#39;t understand how someone could possibly live life in what I perceive as a mundane fashion and appreciate it. You have the gift of life - so go live it.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Solo climbing is just a means to an end - If it wasn&amp;#39;t climbing it could be anything. Your really talking about exploring passion.  Not that namby pamby kissy sort of passion. I mean the sort of passion that burns in side you like a supernova.  Passion that gives a life a vibrant colour and makes people die for a cause. Its certainly not about being in love with near death experiences - its about being in love with life so much, life its self is worth dying for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First what makes you think life is supposed to be appreciated instead of lived?  Second, if you don&amp;#39;t enjoy life you won&amp;#39;t want to keep living?  Third, only when you face death can you really appreciate life?  And finally fourth, what makes life so important that you need to live in a bubble to appreciate it?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The answer to these questions is different for each person. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You have just as good a chance of dying by driving a car. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also you have to understand that life is deadly, it kills everyone. So to live in a bubble is a way you can live, but that is probably way to boring for a lot of people. Some people need to feel the adrenaline rush of dangerous actions. Those types of people call that living and your way is just as bad as dying or being in prison. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Long story short, it is an opinion that differs with each person. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Think of it this way, when you play music the point of the music is not to reach the end, the point is to just play. The same goes for life, not to hide from danger until death, not to live just so you can die old, but to play life and live it to the fullest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"I believe that if you don't believe in contraceptives because they are not natural, then you should also not believe in infertility treatments. CMV","If you think that using contraceptives like condoms, the pill, or inserts are not natural and therefore should not be used, then you should also think that infertility treatments should not be used either. If you don't want the benefit of science to help you not have children, why would you want it to help you have children? Both cases are unnatural and all I see is a hypocrite.   If you have a valid reason to not use contraceptives, then thats fine, I would not call you a hypocrite. Only to the people that use the ""Its not natural"" argument.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the religious arguments of that sort come from a teleological basis which says that the only correct way to use something is in line with the &amp;quot;purpose&amp;quot; it was designed for, which they call the &amp;quot;natural function&amp;quot;.  What this means with respect to reproductive organs is that the only way to use them correctly is to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the case of infertility, this is then seen as the organs in question being defective, as they formed in such a way as to frustrate their natural end (much like a hammer with a broken handle), so repairing this broken part is considered acceptable, as you are trying to facilitate its natural function, not prevent it.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since they use &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; in this specific way, it keeps their stance from being hypocritical on that level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that conclusive counter-arguments have already been presented in this discussion, but I would like to add that the logical problem that you are complaining about is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; hypocrisy, it is inconsistency.  Hypocrisy would be to publicly oppose contraception while secretly still using it.  Hypocrisy is the double standard, requiring others to conform to some standard to which you personal do not conform.  When you make assertions that contract each other in some way, that is a problem with logical consistency.  In any event, while one could argue that it is more consistent to oppose all medical intervention in the reproductive process, it is quite true as others have observed, that you can have a consistent viewpoint that people should reproduce, and therefore medical science should help people to reproduce rather than giving them means to avoid reproducing.  That is not my view, but it is a consistent view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: I believe that delivery driving using your own vehicle (e.g. Pizza) is under-paid.,"This CMV comes from Australia, where tipping isn't much of a thing.   I believe that the wage of food delivery drivers, plus any additional delivery pay isn't sufficient considering the fuel costs and wear/tear on their personal vehicles.

CMV: Anyone willing to be vegetarian for moral reasons should should go vegan.,"This is my first post on Reddit ever. I just found this sub-reddit tonight as I was thinking about a lot of opinion topics so I thought it would be a good time to express this opinion of mine. Disclaimer: I'm neither a vegan nor a vegetarian.  I understand that many vegetarians abstain from meat because they feel morally guilty or they feel that it is wrong to kill animals for food. I suppose that some vegetarians may just not want to take part in eating meat themselves and don't really care about the bigger picture but that seems like a shallow and pointless reason to be a vegetarian to me. While meat-eaters don't actively kill the animals themselves by eating them, they support the slaughterhouses and farms that do kill the animals for food production by continuing to consume meat. If meat is demanded it will be supplied, and vegetarians aim to reduce the demand. This to me seems like a much more legitimate purpose and reasoning for being vegetarian. This same philosophy compels people to vote in democratic governments. Even if they are only one person, it takes many individuals to come together to elect representatives. This is the most valid argument that I can think of in favor of moral vegetarianism.  This philosophy is all fine and good but vegetarians alone will not and cannot fulfill this goal by virtue of not being vegans. As long as dairy products and eggs are consumed, there is still a need for dairy cows and egg-laying chickens. When the cows no longer produce milk and the chickens no longer lay eggs what do you think happens to them? Generally they are turned into meat for human consumption. Vegetarians drink milk and eat cheese that comes from cows that get slaughtered. The only way to lessen meat production is to reduce the number of people with any kind of need or want for animal products. Maybe I'm wrong about what vegetarians aim to accomplish exactly.

But all morality is a compromise. If I truly lived to my own moral standards, I would be giving far more to the needy, living more frugally, using my free time to be politically active in causes I believed in, etc etc. Instead I do what I can, and accept I am not perfect. Every little bit counts. This is not a reason to not try.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is no moral difference between two worlds where in one, half the world was vegan, and the other, everyone just ate half as much meat and dairy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what you think someone&amp;#39;s reason should be, people have different reasons. Neither being vegetarian nor being vegan makes any difference, so you can easily say that every vegetarian &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; be an activist and fight harder to make a change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I totally understand that some people simply don&amp;#39;t want to part take in something they see as negative. I was always against bad treatment of animals but i wasn&amp;#39;t vegetarian because it wouldn&amp;#39;t make a difference. Because of my dog, one day it got harder to have the distance between meat and animal I felt before and meat got less appealing to me. I don&amp;#39;t think by not eating it I am making a change, but I feel cleaner personally. And I will still occasionally eat it if I feel like it or it is simpler than a veggie option. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People can choose to which extent they want to get into something. I would never give up dairy because I love it and benefit to the world is non existent. But I assume many vegetarians can get their dairy and eggs from better sources, local farms etc where animals aren&amp;#39;t treated badly. For some it is a purely health concern, so all together, there is an incentive to treat animals better for these purposes. Since it is totally possible to eat eggs from chickens who live decent lives, no one needs to be vegan,&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Having said all that, things still add up. so between people concerned about their own health, moral vegetarians, total vegans, occasional vegetarians, people who simply care about their sources of food etc, a trend is being created that might lead to more humane methods of treating animals. So it&amp;#39;s pointless to say what someone should do if they care, and let people choose in which way they want to participate and what is good and healthy for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: Clapping at the movie theatre when the film finishes is pointless.,"I go to the movies a lot and it seems to happen pretty often that when the film finishes people in the audience will clap. I've never understood this as no one who had a part in making the film can hear the clapping. I could understand if it was a special screening, premiere, or there was an actor from the film or a special guest in the audience. But for normal movie-going circumstances, it just doesn't make any sense to me. Please change my view so I can stop getting annoyed when a theatre full of people clap.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clapping at the end of a movie you enjoyed is cathartic. It&amp;#39;s a form of expression showing how much you enjoyed the movie. Clapping is more for the person doing it. For example, if you&amp;#39;re excited you might jump up and down or if your nervous you&amp;#39;ll pave, it&amp;#39;s a release of energy. Clapping at the end of a movie is slightly different from a live performance. You&amp;#39;re clapping in support of those performers and letting the psychically see how much you enjoyed it. It&amp;#39;s still a cathartic expression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haven’t you ever been near a sports fan clapping in front of the TV after their team scored the winning touch down? Clapping isn’t just a way to directly show the artist/athlete that “you approve”, it’s also a physical form of “release” that the viewer partakes in after witnessing something that made them excited and/or feel connected on a deep level. It’s sort of like when someone dances around after finding out they landed a new job – same concept. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: Want a world with more trees? Use more paper. Want to keep endangered animals from going extinct? Turn them into food.,"It really just seems to come down to supply and demand. Just about all of our paper comes from privately owned forests called ""managed timberlands,"" where trees are grown specifically to be pulped for paper production. No need for paper? No need for the trees. So the question is, do you want to live on a planet with more trees, or less trees? If you want more, then use as much paper as possible. Boosting demand will boost supply, and, voilà! More trees!  Same goes for endangered species. You don't see cows going extinct any time soon, do you? Why? Because we eat them. Where there's a demand, there is (or will soon be) a supply. So if McDonalds started selling a McBengal patty melt, POOF! No more looming Bengal Tiger extinction.  I'm not actually suggesting that we start eating every endangered species, or that we go around wasting paper. But it makes sense on paper. What am I missing?  EDIT: Thanks for all of your responses! This was really more of a showerthought, but I wanted help vetting whether or not these ideas held any water. The verdict: they don't, haha. But I appreciate everyone taking the time to give me a lot of solid reasons not to go around telling people they should waste paper and eat tigers. Cheers ^_^ _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

One, most things in nature, particularly animals, -aren&amp;#39;t- useful to humans and would be difficult or impossible to make useful.  Domestication requires animals to already have pack/herd/social instincts which can be emphasized through selective breeding (such as the successful Soviet endeavor to domesticate foxes).  It&amp;#39;s a very lengthy and difficult process, and with something like tigers, a very dangerous one--and because of that, likely not economically viable, if it were possible at all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Second, humans have a very well-established track record of overusing resource-bearing wild plants and animals until they go extinct.  There&amp;#39;s plenty of examples in the modern day (such as hunting elephants and rhinos for their ivory), but there are examples even going back to classical history (such as the Greeks and Romans overuse of silphium as a natural form of birth control).

I am a teenage girl who is a huge fan of Young Adult literature. I have been an enthusiast of vlogbrothers and many of John and Hank's other channels long before having read any of John's books. It seemed to be a no brainer that I would love them.   However, they fell extremely flat for me.

"I don't see any reason to allow cellphones, laptops, or tablets in my classroom. CMV.","I am a college literature and composition professor and a lover of technology, but I don't see any reason to permit cellphones, laptops, or tablets in my classroom. It is difficult for me to view these devices as anything but a distraction. Sure, there are a few occasions throughout the semester where having access to computers is helpful, and I do use slideshows, the internet, and the projector nearly every class. We watch movies and YouTube clips and play around with Rap Genius. But most of the time, for the courses and subjects that I teach, I cannot think of any real reasons why the average student would require access to his or her phone or laptop everyday in class, especially for things such as note-taking or calendar apps.   Yes, there are exceptions. Students with learning disabilities, for instance, might require specific technology, and students should have their phones with them in the event of an emergency. I know there are inventive curricula being implemented by professors who are incorporating technology in meaningful ways, but I find it hard to imagine how the majority of these techniques would improve the in-class teaching of literature and writing.   Of course, the real problem for me is that it is impossible to monitor what students are actually doing on their laptops during class. A student may insist she needs her laptop or tablet to take notes, but how in the world can I stop her from surfing the web and distracting not only herself but the rest of the class?  In the last two years, I have found that students are becoming increasingly defensive and stubborn when it comes to this issue. This semester I am teaching adult learners for the first time in ten years, and they are even more rigid and inflexible than college freshmen, even though my syllabus clearly states my policies and I went over my issues with phones and laptops in the first class.   The last thing I want to do is waste class time policing my students or calling them out for being on their phones. I would rather just be cool with students using their devices. I think back to when I was in college and how I would draw in my notebooks during lectures, a habit that was not a distraction for me but in fact helped me to listen better to the professor. But doodling in notebooks or passing notes seems way different than scrolling through Facebook and Tumblr. Is it too much to ask students to spend two hours away from their precious screens?

Well first let me start by saying that I don&amp;#39;t think white people have any business swooping into Africa and trying be a saviour, or trying to teach Africans how to live in Africa.  I also don&amp;#39;t believe that aid in the form of food aid or otherwise should be designed carelessly.  When little thought is put into how aid is delivered it can often build a dependence on that aid instead of having the intended effect of alleviating poverty. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Additionally, I think the free market has a role to play, a significant one, in changing the economic trajectory of any country.  Sub-Saharan African countries are no exception. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That said, there are cases where aid has been given in a more appropriate way.  In these cases the aid played a role in allowing the community to get back on it&amp;#39;s feet enough to begin to enter into the market, and then create their own economic stability. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two examples that come to mind are the primary school funding that Australia has provided to East Timor, and that Germany has provided for Ghana.  Their school enrolment increased, as did literacy.  As a result upon graduation from elementary school these children will be able to run shops, or better sell farmed goods in their communities.  Without access to school and literacy they may have been limited to burning wood for charcoal to sell - which is basically a non-subsistence living. Although better managing a farm, or working in shop may not sound glamorous, the effect is huge on a nation-wide scale.  Before, these were communities more or less unable to participate in the global market, and now they can. This is aid well done, and money well spent because as these communities develop they will no longer need external support. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An excellent example of health care related aid is the Cuban-East Timor doctor training program.  East Timor has significantly more well trained, world class doctors today than it did even five years ago.  Although the effects will take some time to be fully realized, when populations have basic access to health care the sick people that could not work or earn, do and therefore spend, etc. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The whole point is to take communities to a baseline level of ability to work, earn, and spend.  After that the development more or less runs itself. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The global example is Asia.  Countries like Japan, Korea, Thailand, even Cambodia, were ravaged by war and without American aid dollars they would not have been able to establish a baseline of education and health for their populations to work.  Japan and Korea are now powerful economies.  Thailand is one of the fastest developing countries in the world and a huge producer of commercial goods, and Cambodia, poor as it still is - is beginning to see factories open up, and see foreign investment coming into the capital.  It&amp;#39;s important to remember that only one generation ago Cambodia became the fighting ground for someone else&amp;#39;s war, suffered a genocide, and that genocide killed the overwhelming majority of the country&amp;#39;s educated population. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And, let&amp;#39;s not forget the development in Asia has been good for the West too!  Cheap goods flooding in from Asian producers has kept Western costs of living lower than they otherwise would have been, and giving that the real cost of living has increased in America, mitigating the climb is important. Aid for Africa helps us too. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think it boils down to three things: health, education, and food. Can we share the knowledge, technology, and money to help these countries get their populations to a point where they can grow their own food, have a healthy enough population to work, and have an educated enough population to work.  After that the generational power of progress takes over. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edited for grammar.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve commented on the economic side of aide, but I&amp;#39;d like to look at the political side. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think it is very important not to lump 47 distinct countries or regions into one pot.  Obviously there are places like the DRC that have been mired in civil war for so long that effective aid, and sustainable development is almost unimaginable at this point. There are also countries in that pot like Ghana, South Africa, Botswana, Gabon, and Kenya that have developing and are globally relevant economies.  These counties also have relatively stable politics with containable amounts of corruption.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It would be unfair, and uncalled for to write these counties off because other countries in the region experience extreme unrest and corruption.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Again, political tides can turn quickly.  Only twenty years ago South Africa was in apartheid.  Only 22 years ago Ghana was a one party state. 24 years ago Gabon was also a one party state.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even extreme situations can come around quickly.  Sierra Leone&amp;#39;s vicious civil war ended 12 years ago after a decade of fighting.  Many politicians during the 90&amp;#39;s thought Sierra Leone was a lost cause.  Today they are a democracy, and although still very underdeveloped, they are starting to see foreign investment come in, and a slow transition from subsistence agriculture to cash crops. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For me, these examples demonstrate that political instability or even war cannot be reasons that countries are written off entirely. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edited for grammar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: I think it should be legal for people to change their birthdate.,"I know that your birthdate is the day you were born, but a lot of things are legally one way, but physically another. I would, however, want it to be limited so you can only make yourself 90 days older or 90 days younger, and once every 10 years, so we won't see things like high schoolers making themselves 21. Some people want to get their kids into school earlier, legally do certain things slightly earlier, or just don't like the date of their birthday.

CMV: Bar / Nightclub culture would be more fun / safer for women if there were more gay men harassing straight men.,"Hear me out on this one.  The other day I had to step in and help a woman who was quite obviously uncomfortable with the way a man at the bar we were all at was talking to her.  She said thank you, I apologized, and she said ""Oh it's okay, it's something you kind of expect when you go out"".  And she started telling me TONS of stories about similar, and worse encounters.    I spend a lot of time going to gay bars, and the energy there is just completely different.  Every person in the room has guaranteed been flirted with before, comfortably, and uncomfortably, and are thus a lot more polite about it.  They can all empathize with what it feels like to be on the receiving end of a man flirting with you when you're not interested.  I've never had an uncomfortable situation arise with turning anyone down, which as a straight man happens pretty much every time someone hits on me at a gay bar.  None of my ""awkward"" stories even *compared* to anything close to what this woman at the bar experienced basically every time she went out.  Why is that?  Simple.  Straight men *usually* have no idea what it feels like to be in that situation.  Girls don't often uncomfortably hit on them, thus they shoehorn themselves into this terrifying predator / prey relationship and as a result we get tons of terrible sexual assault and uncomfortable situations.  The solution?  I think the world would be a better place if bars and nightclubs hired a group of intimidating, hairy gay men to roam around their establishment uncomfortably hitting on the guys there.  Show them some humility, put them in the same position they put women.  Obviously every guy isn't the type of person who would uncomfortably hit on a woman, or worse, but most guys *are* the types of guys who would just ignore that sort of thing if they saw it, shrugging it off as a symptom of dating culture.  These people could also benefit from knowing what it feels like to be hit on by a big gay bear man.  Edit:  Obviously this is a silly solution to a serious problem.  Please also try and CMV that there are better ways to handle the issue! _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Being a victim yourself doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily reduce the likelihood that you&amp;#39;ll be a perpetrator.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Look how many child abusers were themselves abused as children.  Or how many perpetrators of domestic violence have, themselves, been victims.  The empathy might work for a handful of people, but for the drunk people that are harassing women, being harassed themselves isn&amp;#39;t going to suddenly open their eyes about how it makes other people feel.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re drunk.  If they were thinking logically they wouldn&amp;#39;t probably be in that position to begin with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I state my view on this I would like to say that it is apparent (whether true or not I just mean visible) that women are more aggressively propositioned than men are. That being said I have been propositioned by both men and women. I can only think of one occasion where a man has propositioned me and he was definitely persistent; though that may have been because I was not clear enough or he was too drunk to realize.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem isn&amp;#39;t a matter of empathy, but a matter of communication and entitlement. A pleasant conversation between two people at a club can be interpreted as friendly or flirting. Alcohol sure as hell doesn&amp;#39;t help make intentions clearer. I believe that drunk people are like children. They feel everything to excess. Anger, happiness, sadness, arousal, and really any other emotion seems to be amplified. This is why people do stupid things when they are hammered. Alcohol does also impair decision making, so the rational thought &amp;quot;Hey I probably should leave this girl alone.&amp;quot; does not occur.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think harassing men would do very much to help the situation. This is because the people who make the bar/club unsafe for women are not the people who would see the error of their ways. Rape is an act of power and therefore placing a person willing to rape in a situation in which they would feel helpless could actually do the opposite of the desired effect. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would also like to state that most guys do not ignore that type of shit. If you see that shit happen at a club/bar try telling a random group of guys what is happening. Regardless if you know them or what is happening they will come to help you and the victim. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I understand what you mean though, most people don&amp;#39;t notice it or are willfully ignorant. Putting someone in the situation where they are forced to witness what is happening will force them to act. Especially if they are in greater number. Nobody wants to act alone, but everyone wants to be apart of the crowd doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To sum it up: Placing gay propositioners will do nothing (in my opinion) to make bars/clubs safer. Showing bar/club goers that that sort of behavior will. So we should ban all alcohol. Just kidding alcohol fucking rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Bathrooms divided by gender are useless.,"I think there is no reason why we should have different public bathrooms for different genders. Both men and women use the stalls and I see no problem if the stall next to it is used by someone of a different gender.   As for the urinals, I think with partitioning walls between the urinals, that prevent any accidental side glances onto anyones exposed genitalia, there is no reason why a woman shouldn't see the fully clothed back of a man while he's peeing.   Not dividing bathrooms would be slightly more practical in regards to room and plumbing and it would benefit transgender people. Also it might help us all to get less weird about the opposite gender and their bodily functions, if we shared a bathroom. Although my main point is not, that the non-dividing would be tremendously useful, I just think there really is no good reason to divide bathrooms by gender.   Alright, I'm ready to have my view changed!    **Edit:** What I've learned so far:  1. I come from a pretty privileged point of view when it comes to sexual harassment of any kind. This leads me to believe that a neutral bathroom would be fine. Apparently the experience of people (mainly women) in other parts of the world is vastly different, so it probably wouldn't be fine there.   2. US bathroom stalls are parted by very small walls, while bathroom stalls where I live are often parted by full size walls reaching to the ceiling and floor, so any kind of peeping over the stall wall would be much less of a problem around here.   3. I need to work on my use of sex and gender. In my language they are both the same word, we don't have that difference, so I mess them up a lot. I will work on that.   4. People are surprisingly passionate about who they share a bathroom with.   5. People are irrationally afraid of hearing women poop. Get a grip, women have bowel movements too! People are also irrationally afraid of someone hearing them poop. Get over it, everybody shits.  So, view changed? Kind of. I recognize that my experience is not universal and that it would be a much bigger problem in other places. I still think that unisex bathrooms would work fine around here and I heard many examples where they do work fine. But in other parts of the world, where the real and/or the perceived danger of sexual harassment is higher it is different.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Both men and women use the stalls and I see no problem if the stall next to it is used by someone of a different gender.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Already you&amp;#39;re off to a weird start. You say that you think we shouldn&amp;#39;t have different public bathrooms for different &lt;em&gt;genders&lt;/em&gt;, yet you refer to different &lt;em&gt;sexes&lt;/em&gt; in your next sentence. So which is it? Genders or sexes?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll assume you&amp;#39;re talking about sexes just so I can proceed with my post. That said, there are actually quite a few problems with this: sexual harassment, promiscuity, voyeurism, general creepiness... I could go on but I think that&amp;#39;s enough.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for the urinals, I think with partitioning walls between the urinals, that prevent any accidental side glances onto anyones exposed genitalia, there is no reason why a woman shouldn&amp;#39;t see the fully clothed back of a man while he&amp;#39;s peeing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re assuming that this will be the case with every man and woman at every instance of entering a bathroom. Have you ever considered that women may not be comfortable with looking at a man peeing even if he is fully-clothed from the back? And have you ever considered that the bathroom may be more than just a place to piss and shit for women? Women go to the bathroom to socialize, in packs. It&amp;#39;s a safe zone, a completely anti-male place. Removing that will make women feel unsafe. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not dividing bathrooms would be slightly more practical in regards to room and plumbing &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wait, what? How? If you&amp;#39;re trying to provide the space for the same population of people, logic dictates that it would be the same amount of space. How that space is divided doesn&amp;#39;t exactly matter. And I don&amp;#39;t even know how it would be beneficial in regards to plumbing. I&amp;#39;m not a plumber, and I don&amp;#39;t know how any of the water systems in a bathroom function so I&amp;#39;m not going to comment on that, but I fail to see how making a bathroom open to both sexes would make the plumbing more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;and it would benefit transgender people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Again: why and how? First of all, you&amp;#39;re still being vague with your argument, using the term &amp;quot;gender&amp;quot; to stand in for &amp;quot;sex&amp;quot;, so I&amp;#39;m not even sure what your argument is anymore. And secondly, how? You can&amp;#39;t just say &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;ll benefit them&amp;quot; as a point.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also it might help us all to get less weird about the opposite gender and their bodily functions, if we shared a bathroom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand this point. I&amp;#39;m going to stop mentioning that you keep using genders to refer to sexes because at this point, I don&amp;#39;t even think you understand your own argument. First of all, I think as adults, we&amp;#39;re all aware of one another&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;bodily functions&amp;quot;. Some people talk about them, some don&amp;#39;t. I know that my girlfriend and I are completely open about this kind of thing while other people would rather hang themselves than talk about their bathroom life. Second of all, getting &amp;quot;less weird&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t something that would be beneficial for some people. It&amp;#39;s not weird to not want to talk about stuff that grosses you out. I personally don&amp;#39;t give a shit (no pun intended), but I know people who have to leave the room when there&amp;#39;s talk of blood or poop because they&amp;#39;re really weak in that sense. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although my main point is not, that the non-dividing would be tremendously useful, I just think there really is no good reason to divide bathrooms by gender.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are many good reasons to keep bathrooms the way they are right now (see my list above). It&amp;#39;s the best system of separation which guarantees the best protection for both sexes, socially and physically. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; You make broad generalizations, don&amp;#39;t understand your own argument, and have no concrete facts to back your claims. The best I can do is just tell you you&amp;#39;re wrong. However, if you&amp;#39;d like to put forth a better argument for your view, I&amp;#39;d be happy to try again with a more organic process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;After thinking about it further (pretty sure my other post got buried), I think schools probably provide the biggest stumbling block currently. Not as much for the gender/sex issues that would arise from putting kids together at a young age, but more for the problems that it would cause the school:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Potential for upsetting parents who don&amp;#39;t agree with the merge. Not the most intellectual reason, but certainly provides a use for the school board. Angry parents tend to be the most obnoxious on the job hazard people who work in schools have to deal with.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Potential for bullying and pranks on the opposite sex as well. Kids can be mean for a myriad of reasons, and being different is high on that list. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Raging hormones and tightly enclosed spaces. Sure, they&amp;#39;ll probably have sex at some point anyways, but there&amp;#39;s no need to help facilitate it during school hours.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;All the other issues that have been laid out above.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The real question is can the schools legitimately put students at risk while they&amp;#39;re still at a developing age. Parents lose their minds over the simplest things. Having their daughter raped at school would certainly be one of the more valid ones to do so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"I don't think it's possible for people to genuinely enjoy themselves in a bar where recorded music is played too loud for conversation to be possible, and that the multitudes of people who subject themselves to this indignity are suffering from a grand delusion or a lack of ambition. CMV.","I just don't see how it's possible. Yet, I'm confused because it seems like there are so few bars on earth that I can even walk into without being assailed by loud music. I'm not a curmudgeon either; I'm 23 years old and apparently should find a way to enjoy places like this.   Not that I'm against loud music either, but it has its setting. If you go to a concert then the music is the main event; people are primarily there to enjoy the live performance and not only does it seem acceptable for it to be loud but even at times a part of the performance and art of it that the vibrations overtake the audience in a way that makes them feel the music is physically as well as audibly experienced.   I'll also sometimes play loud music in my own home during the daytime, especially classical music as it contains many instrument voicings and dynamics that can't be fully appreciated when you aren't hearing it at concert volume. However, this is a solitary activity and it would be rude for me to keep it going if I were entertaining company.  At a bar, conversation is the event. You're specifically coming in to spend time with other people and share drinks with them. They build tables in round or half-round shapes so that you can face your company as you drink, as if to have a conversation.  Yet, the recorded music is played so loudly that it's utterly impossible to do one of two things that you're there to do. Why would I want to drink with someone if I wasn't going to talk to them? I can not talk to people when I drink alone at home and much more affordably and with much higher quality spirits.  My fundamental confusion is this, I've never heard anyone speak positively about a bar where loud music is played even once. I've never heard anyone make an argument or even be capable of conceiving of an argument as to how such an establishment could be an enjoyable place to spend your time. I have no idea if anyone on earth has an intellectual notion as to how it's even acceptable to support such an inconsiderate establishment. Yet, almost all bars are like this.   So I see a sharp disparity between the intellectual understanding of a good time and the establishments that exist. How can this be?

"I believe that people who love old wines, whiskeys and scotches are lying to appear classier. CMV","I find these drinks to be repulsive at best and fail to see how anyone would like to drink a hundred-dollar sip of burnt wood flavoured, high-proof-tasting alcohol. I feel that people who like these drinks like them solely due to the fact that it is culturally ""high-class"" and fancy to drink aged alcohols. People don't chew on charcoal for fun, why would they drink something that tastes like it? Especially since the small quantities they drink are hardly enough to even feel a buzz off of.   In essence, I feel that having an appreciation for these drinks is a massive circle jerk that no one seems to acknowledge.  Please, change my view.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone answer to this is going to be stupid.  People are going to say things like &amp;quot;Some people DO!&amp;quot; which is a typical childish argument you hear from Reddit all the time.  So, as a scotch lover, I am going to clear all this up for you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People start drinking scotch because its expensive and high class.  It taste like shit at first.  They keep drinking it because they really want to be classy, and eventually they get used to the taste.  After more classiness they start to like it.  This is where I am at.  I started drinking this stuff for the reasons you listed, but actually ended up really liking it after a few weeks.  The reason you can&amp;#39;t do this with other types of alcohol is because those actually DO taste like shit, where as the bad taste of scotch is just the high alcohol content.  So when you get used to the alcohol taste, the rest of it comes out, and THEN it is good.  So you&amp;#39;re partially correct.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well first of all you&amp;#39;d have to accept that many people do actually like the taste, even though you personally don&amp;#39;t.  I&amp;#39;ll admit it was an acquired taste where i didnt like most alcoholic beverages at first, but over time those flavors built up positive associations in my mind and i found myself enjoying them.  Despite not particularly.liking them at first, nowadays i&amp;#39;ll have some whiskey just for the pleasre of drinking it (flavor, feel, and buzz).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for the aged aspect, I&amp;#39;ll continue to use whisky as the example because that&amp;#39;s what i enjoy.  If you can accept that people even somewhat enjoy whisky, then the next thing to understand is this: aged whiskey is just &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; in every way.  It&amp;#39;s smoother, the flavors are both gentler and more pronounced.  If someone thinks johnny walker red is OK, they will LOVE lafroig 12 year or whatever.  Single malt is more expensive and fancier, but it&amp;#39;s also a world of difference in flavor from blended whiskys.  So while I&amp;#39;m sure some people fake it to look high class, there are also valid logical paths that many take to genuinely liking this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On a similar note, a final thought.  I grew up working class, but in my adulthood I&amp;#39;ve been able to advance to upper class.  I went from spaghetti dinner because that&amp;#39;s what my parents could afford to fine dining on a corporate expense account.  I dont say this to brag, but clarify why I&amp;#39;m very qualified to say this: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Expensive    high class food and drink is generally considered that for a reason: because it&amp;#39;s fucking &lt;em&gt;way better&lt;/em&gt;.  Do you think rich people (my boss&amp;#39;s boss) give a fuck if poor people think they are classy?  Fuck no.  They eat at fine restaurants, smoke cubans, and drink aged whisky because that shit is amazingly better than the cheap shit, and they can afford it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Forgive my typing errors, wrote this on phone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I believe that homosexuality and Christianity are incompatible. CMV.,"I believe that homosexuality and Christianity are incompatible. That is, identifying as both a homosexual and a Christian is unjustifiable. It is evident that the bible takes an anti-homosexual stance. I am working under the assumption that all brands of Christianity accept every word written in the bible; otherwise, it seems that this would not be true Christianity.  It may be worth noting that I do not identify as either homosexual or Christian. I am posting this with hope that others can provide insight into my belief. Thank you.  Edit: for clarification, I meant that being a true Christian (who does not intentionally break the laws of Christianity) and being homosexual is not a logical position.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the others are saying about your assumption that all brands of Christianity accept every word written in the Bible is important. There are so many types of Christianity it would take me all day to name them all (and there are probably more types than I know). My Christianity professor once said &amp;quot;If you ask 6 Christians a theological question, you will get 7 unique answers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That out of the way, I can see you&amp;#39;re more interested in hearing about Biblical interpretations that justify homosexuality. While I fall in the camp of Christianity that doesn&amp;#39;t believe the Bible is infallible, I have grown up in an environment where all the Christians around me do. The argument in favor of both Biblical inerrancy and homosexuality is that the verses that condemn it are misinterpreted:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Old Testament verses in Leviticus that are often cited could be argued to be in the same camp as the laws about not eating pork and shellfish: Jesus came and established a New Covenant which basically threw out the strict legalism of the Old Testament, with all of its highly specific laws and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The New Testament references in Paul&amp;#39;s letters don&amp;#39;t actually use a word that specifically means &amp;quot;homosexual&amp;quot;. The word he uses is better translated (and in some translations is) as &amp;quot;sexual deviants&amp;quot;, which is unspecific about to whom it refers. Some people take this to mean everything from oral sex to beastiality. It&amp;#39;s not clear what Paul was specifically referring to. While one could still argue that this includes homosexuality, if one did not believe homosexuality to be deviancy (like most Christians are fine with oral sex despite some claiming it to be deviant), then these verses do not condemn homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My personal belief on the matter is a bit less sure. I am open to the possibility that homosexuality is a sin, but I believe that if Jesus met a homosexual man he would show him nothing but love and understanding. Whether someone is homosexual or not does not affect the way I see them or treat them, and I believe that it shouldn&amp;#39;t. I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s a sin or not-- I don&amp;#39;t think we can know for sure, since the verses are so vague, but I find it hard to believe that the same loving God who we say embodies love would condemn real love in any form. And unless I were homosexual or someday had a child who was homosexual, I don&amp;#39;t feel like it&amp;#39;s important for me to be sure one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The short of it is, Christianity is about loving each other, loving God, and believing in the sacrifice of Jesus. That&amp;#39;s the heart of it, and if you believe that you are absolutely a Christian, no matter what your sexual orientation. All the other things are rules, many of which I believe were made by men who thought they correctly interpreted God&amp;#39;s intentions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is evident that the bible takes an anti-homosexual stance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Actually, no. The particular New Testament (Pauline) scripture that is used to justify anti-homosexual stances among Christians originally referred to male prostitution, not homosexuality. Even had it referred to homosexuality, according to Christianity as commonly preached, we are all sinners, and Jesus specifically points this out in the Sermon on the Mount. No sin is worse than any other, and no matter what sins one commits, Christ will forgive (according to mainstream Christianity). Also note that Jesus, according to scripture, used to hang out with pretty much the worst sinners one could find at the time (and homosexuals are not mentioned among those, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for old testament scripture, well, there&amp;#39;s a lot of things forbidden by the OT that Christians do without even considering it. Eating pork, for instance. Jesus was supposed to have fulfilled the old covenant, anyway, so those rules are generally considered no longer binding.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(Note: I am not a Christian, I&amp;#39;m just trying to explain how one can reconcile being one while being a homosexual, practising or otherwise).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: The USA spends a ridiculous amount of money on our military.,"Couple things: Yeah, I know this has been posted before, but the people who have posted this before didn't care about other's opinions and were trying to defend their own opinions. This isn't the case for me. I really want to hear other's opinions on this topic.   I love my country (America) but I think we spend way too much on defense. [Here's](http://imgur.com/kFBcJkL) a chart from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute that shows the US defense spending versus other major powers in the world. As you can see, the US spends more than all of them combined. We, as one country shouldn't be spending so much money on our military if there isn't a big enough threat from any major power to even nick, much less eradicate the United States. $640B to fight the terrorist groups that pose a threat right now?

Would I support cuts to military spending? Maybe. Regardless, military spending isn&amp;#39;t solely to go and fight terrorists. When there is a natural disaster somewhere in the world, the U.S. is generally there right away to provide support because it has the resources to be all over the world at once. The U.S. military patrols important trade routes around the world. The military also spends a great deal of money on research and development of new technologies. While this is to develop military technology, many of this can then be used for in non-military situations. For example, the use of drones has rapidly risen in the military. While you may or may not support the use of drones, the military has had to spend a lot of time and use a lot of resources to develop this technology which can then be used outside of the military. Lets say someone gets lost hiking on a mountain. Instead of sending out a search team, you could send up a couple drones which put less people at risk and can probably find the person faster. Drones will most likely be used for delivery in the future (as we&amp;#39;ve seen from Amazon&amp;#39;s plans). They can used for farming to monitor crops. Without the U.S. spending the amount of money that it does on the military things like these may have taken much longer to develop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, the US is the de facto &amp;quot;world police force&amp;quot;, whether or not some countries actually want this or we can agree if it&amp;#39;s a good thing.

This means that the US is required to maintain power projection capabilities, which is expensive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a breakdown of the US military budget, where you can get a better understanding of why it&amp;#39;s so costly.  You&amp;#39;ll also notice that it&amp;#39;s a 10% decreased from &amp;#39;12 to &amp;#39;13.  Not bad.  I&amp;#39;ll hit the bigger ones.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll see that the vast majority of the budget just goes to maintenance and personnel.  Meaning that we&amp;#39;re supplying people with jobs, training and other opportunity which is generally a good thing.  Without such a large military you&amp;#39;d lose out on a lot of jobs and training opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Atomic Energy Defense is essentially what it costs to maintain our nuclear force.  Our nuclear force is an important stabilizer, and keeps other nations in check.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Procurement is good for industries that support the military.  That&amp;#39;s a lot of jobs employing the people who make, support and maintain stuff that gets sold to the military.  Military investment in these industries also allows for cool tech to trickle into the regular consumer market.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;R&amp;amp;D goes along the same lines as Procurement, in that we&amp;#39;re investing in developing tech that will probably trickle into the consumer market someday and benefit us all.  There are long lists of things that were invented for the military and now benefit you today.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, of all these things there&amp;#39;s always room to make cuts, however a lot of these things are either directly or indirectly beneficial to the consumer sectors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: A congressional ""re-boot"" would breathe new life into the legislative branch of the federal U.S. government.","It would be interesting to see this enacted, at least as a one-time experiment; call it congressional defibrillation.  I am nowhere near an expert in government or politics, so I apologize sincerely to those to whom this argument sounds painfully naive and ignorant and to you I say do your worst--I'll listen.  For one chosen term (not sure how this would be selected just yet), do not allow any incumbent to run for re-election. No incumbents whatsoever, unless anyone can think of any reasonable exceptions. Perhaps try this only for the House, since I'm not sure how you would go about doing it for the Senate with their staggered election cycles (though I'm sure a program could be devised).  Then, after one or two terms, allow old incumbents to run again. This could be more than one or two terms; the idea is to allow at least enough time for the effects of an all-freshman Congress to develop its own culture and start making things happen unique to that Congress.  The reason I currently believe this would be successful is I sense that Congress is over-burdened by the weight of tradition and even distracted by it. It's likely to me there are plenty of visionary freshmen, and even visionary candidates, with excellent ideas to help ease gridlock and make efficient progress again, but under the weight of the current institution I propose that it's nearly impossible for this to happen.  Additionally, I do not see any significant drawbacks to this, as a one-time experiment. If it fails, if it's useless, the worst I could see happening is, after the no re-election rule expires, everything returning to normal. Perhaps there could even be a provision in the law which allows for an emergency return of control to the previous Congress in the case of absolute chaos, though I sincerely doubt this would be the case.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In California, for example, a legislator can only serve 6 years in each house of the legislature, and then he/she is done.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But guess what? Instead of reducing corruption and gridlock, the term limits have essentially done the opposite. Now, every couple of years, the state legislature is re-stocked with a bunch of inexperienced people, many of whom have absolutely zero lawmaking experience. These people have no idea how to negotiate things like complex budget deals, and are forced to rely on lobbyists to explain how the system actually works. &lt;a href=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/01/the_folly_of_term_limits.html""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/rb/RB_1104BCRB.pdf""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are two excellent breakdowns of the problems in California.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your scenario would only exacerbate these problems, giving us a Congress filled &lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt; with inexperienced people with little to no governing experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with Congress isn&amp;#39;t career politicians.

Who is anyone to tell voters they&amp;#39;re not allowed to vote for the person they want?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Second, they&amp;#39;re an effective legislator at least in part because they&amp;#39;ve been around Congress long enough to learn how it works and get done what you want to get done. Replace congress whole hog with a bunch of neophytes and you&amp;#39;re just handing power to the people who do have that knowledge.

Congress is ideologically polarized and gridlocked in large part because that&amp;#39;s how our country is right now. There&amp;#39;s a lot of divisive issues with no clear majority and no middle path that both sides will accept. A brand new congress would have these exact same divisions, and the exact same (un)willingness to compromise, because that&amp;#39;s how the people are.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In short, the people, not congress, are the problem here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I think replacing individual vehicles with mass transit for the majority of people would be a good thing. CMV.,"Though transit is currently impractical for many people, I think if we switched over to a system where most people were using transit, it could be much more efficient and thus effective. I mean this for all reasonably sized cities (say 10,000 and up), not just monolithic places like NYC.   It would likely be even more effective if we could re-design our cities to incorporate mass transit. But, for the sake of argument, let's just assume that we keep our cities as is and simply increase the number of buses/trams/subways according to the costs saved by everyone converting their cars into their asset values and applying that to transit infrastructure.  There might still be the need for some vehicles for certain jobs, such as those that need to transport large machines. Those would, however, be business related vehicles.  I'm not sure at all about this view and am open to changing it. So, CMV!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, a key problem with this would be that transport itself would be centralized. I assume the government would maintain and staff the mass transit system. In that case, they&amp;#39;re in a union and could go on strike, could they not? What then?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also the problem that the government would then need to accommodate for everyone, which goes without saying. My family owns a small house about 65 miles out of town, in a village of about 1,000. They&amp;#39;re currently doing renovations and are making the hour-and-a-half long drive back and forth between our two houses. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This would not be possible with mass transit, unless the system were serving a village of a mere thousand people multiple times in a single day and making a 65-mile trek back to town just for two people (or a scarce handful, at least). This is either inefficient or prohibitively expensive for my parents. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It also pretty much prevents any kind of recreational travel unless you&amp;#39;re going along a path set by the government. For example you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to go camping without first requisitioning a bus for the journey somehow, and considering it&amp;#39;s camping, the place you&amp;#39;re going may be very remote and therefore require a lot of resources just to commit that one vehicle. Even if you go in a large group, if it&amp;#39;s all dirt roads, it may not even be able to make the trip!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In cities, yes, mass transit is far more effective. I mean shit, even Simcity demonstrates that. Little traffic, EMS is much faster as a result, it creates jobs, and reduces upkeep cost for roads. It&amp;#39;s the logistics of implementing that nationwide (or even state- or province-wide) that sink this idea for me. It removes too much flexibility in the name of economic simplicity, all the while setting the system up for a sea of red tape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems like you believe, implicitly, that either individual vehicles are inherently &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; and/or mass transit in inherently &amp;quot;good.&amp;quot;  What are the good and bad things about each, and what are the possible effects of replacing cars with mass transit?  I am put in an awkward position of guessing your beliefs here, but I&amp;#39;ll do my best and you can correct me where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Individual vehicles are bad because they cause pollution (via combustion, leaks, etc), require parking/roadways in otherwise highly productive areas, collectively contribute to cogestion which leads to increased commute time, and are susceptible to user errors (accidents, drunk driving, etc).  Individual vehicles are good because the provide convenience, autonomy of destination, personal safety (from individuals, not other vehicles), autonomy of local influences (temperature in cabin, choice of music, cleanliness, etc).  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mass transit is bad because it is less convenient (stops are at predefined times and locations), shared, and inflexible.  Mass transit is good because it can lower congestion, move many people quickly and efficiently (did I just say the same thing twice?), is less likely to crash, and can be used safely while intoxicated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The issue of cost isn&amp;#39;t so much a size issue as a density issue.  Mass transit is cheaper when a people live in a high density area.  But I can work with the assumption that we are discussion cities with high enough population density.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So replacing individual vehicles with mass transit isn&amp;#39;t unambiguously better.  There is a trade off.  There are benefits unique to individual vehicles that are lost when we replace them with mass transit.  Are the safety, autonomy, and convenience costs worth the reduced congestion and pollution benefits?  That&amp;#39;s harder to say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"There is an objective difference between quality wine and 'plonk', and everyone should acknowledge it. CMV.","EDIT: the most common response that I've heard thus far revolved around the use of the word 'quality'. Let me be clear: 'quality' is a measure of the circumstances that surround a product's creation, not the subjective experience of the consumer, or aggregate consumers upon consumption. A product may be pleasing to a large majority of consumers but still be of low quality, given the way it was produced. A Big Mac is enjoyable to a large majority of people: that does not make it quality food. Red Wing boots are well-made, produced by American labor, and over-all excellent foot-ware: that does not make them the perfect shoe for everyone, nor does it make them universally comfortable, fashionable, or practical in all situations.   My only purpose in this OP was to argue that one should not assert that a Big Mac is the same as a filet mignon, or that Uggs are just as good as Red Wings. It's ok to like low-quality things and they have their place. But asserting that they are 'the same' as their high-quality counterparts is wrong.   A few caveats first:   * Price is no indicator of quality. Great wine can be had for $10 and a $200 bottle can be utter crap. I am not suggesting that more expensive or rarer wine is better quality.   * 'Everyone should acknowledge it' is not to say that everyone should instantly recognize and appreciate it. I, for instance, hate the taste of mushrooms: whether they're truffles or factory-grown button mushrooms. However, I can admit that, for people who appreciate and are well-versed in mushrooms, truffles are objectively 'better'. I would never suggest that there is no difference in these mushrooms or that people who claim to know the difference are lying.   Where I take issue are 'studies' like [this](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/23/wine-tasting-junk-science-analysis) and [this](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/drink/2011/11/why_you_should_be_drinking_cheap_wine.html) that assert that wine tasting is 'junk science' and that no one ('professional wine tasters' down to novices) can make an accurate value judgement as to the quality of a wine. I believe that, even if these 'studies' were accurate (which they're not), there still exists an objective standard of quality in wine that should impel the average consumer to avoid mass-produced grocery store wine and seek out 'quality' wines.   * Objective levels of quality exist in every other food product, and it should be so with wine. Wine, like other alcohols (beer and spirits) is fundamentally an agricultural product. The quality of any agricultural product, be it produce, meat, eggs, vegetables, honey, etc. is highly dependent on the care taken by the agriculturalist and the quality of raw materials that the produce is given (sunlight, feed, fertilizer, etc.). We are all comfortable with grading eggs, meats, honey, and produce and assigning value depending on the grade. No one would argue, for instance, that chuck steak is the same as Prime, or that a seller who expects higher prices for a higher grade is attempting to deceive the public. It should be equally accepted that a vintner who foregoes chemical fertilizers and pesticides, who dry-farms instead of irrigates, and who only crops to a certain level should be recognized as a higher quality producer than a vintner who does not do these things.   * Low-quality 'plonk' wine is detrimental to the environment, to workers, and to producers who might enact higher standards. *Vitis Vinifera* is a greedy plant. Left to its own devices, it will spread its root system across the topsoil, depleting mineral elements in about 3 years. In Italy, it is *illegal* to irrigate grape vines after their 1st year in the ground. However, large-scale macro-producers will water the hell out of their vines, rip out, and replant every three years to maximize crop yields. Large producers are also more likely to use chemical fertilizers and pesticides to increase yields, which may contaminate groundwater and streams. Further, large-volume production requires more labor, and lower wages to keep prices of the end-product low. This had lead to worker abuses and deaths in California in recent years. Sustainably-farmed, ethically-run wineries have been increasingly forced to abandon their practices to compete against these macro-producers, which degrades both the quality of the wine and it's sustainability across the industry.  * Wine tasting is a 'science' and legitimate industry professionals *can* detect and correctly identify variation in wine. This is the area where I expect to be linked to all sorts of blogspam from Slate et al. detailing 'studies' that show that the wine industry is some sort of elaborate conspiracy to part fools from their money. First, let me qualify: there are three certifying bodies to which one's belonging qualifies one as a 'wine expert': the [Court of Master Sommeliers](http://www.mastersommeliers.org/), the [Society of Wine Educators](http://www.societyofwineeducators.org/) and the [Masters of Wine](http://www.mastersofwine.org/). If you are not part of one of these three bodies, *you. are. not. a. wine. expert*. In the same way that selling a house does not make you a Realtor, getting CPR certified does not make you a nurse, or defending yourself in court does not make you a lawyer, working in the wine industry, running a wine shop, sitting on a wine tasting panel, or simply liking to drink does not make you a 'wine expert'. Every 'study' I've ever been linked and read fails to qualify the 'experts' used in their study. Until I can see a study that says that Master Sommeliers, Masters of Wine, or Certified Wine Educators were unable to detect variations in wines, your studies are **bunk**. The Master Sommelier examination, which 171 people *in history* have passed, requires its applicants to know on which side of a hill the wine was grown. You can't seriously expect me to think that these people would be fooled with food coloring or a fake label. If legitimate professionals can discern wines from one another and place a value judgement, that judgement must must have a basis in reality.  None of the above is meant to suggest that everyone should drop their Two Buck Chuck and immediately start drinking DOCG Chianti, but consumers need to realize that the vast majority of their daily wine is akin to a McDonald's burger: pleasing, satisfying, but ultimately low-quality. There are objective quality standards to wine, the same way there are to any other food product. I have no problem with anyone drinking what they like, but pretending that they're 'beating the system' by drinking plonk and the rest of us are getting hosed by paying for quality is disingenuous.   CMV.        ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;your mistake is not objectively defining &amp;quot;quality.&amp;quot;  there can be objectively higher and lower quality products, as long as nowhere in the definition of quality do you include any subjective variables.  as soon as you introduce a subjective variable, you preclude objectivity.  &lt;em&gt;taste preference&lt;/em&gt; is an example of a subjective variable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;wine tasters, &lt;em&gt;at best&lt;/em&gt;, may be able to detect subtle nuances in wine that clue them into any number of variables that they associate with their &lt;em&gt;beliefs&lt;/em&gt; about wine quality (variety of grape, conditions of harvest, conditions of storage, age, etc), but this is in no way proves the existence of an objective standard of wine quality.  and it sounds like even &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; ability of wine tasters is scientifically unverified.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;it&amp;#39;s also possible that a culture exists that wine tasters are typically indoctrinated into, where they all develop similar tastes, and so the majority of wine tasters might all agree that some wines actually &lt;em&gt;taste&lt;/em&gt; better than others.  however, that is clearly not a random sample, and so the results are almost guaranteed to be biased.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;so you&amp;#39;re right and you&amp;#39;re wrong, depending on how you define quality.  if you objectively define quality, then it&amp;#39;s a given that there is an objective difference between high quality and low quality.  if there are subjective variables in your definition, then the difference is &lt;em&gt;subjective&lt;/em&gt; and no longer &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most food quality standards refer to healthiness or safety. Those are both definitely objective things. Those can be measured precisely and everyone will agree on them. That&amp;#39;s drastically different from what you&amp;#39;re saying - you&amp;#39;re essentially arguing a tautology. &amp;quot;Different wines are different!&amp;quot; Sure, that&amp;#39;s totally true. What&amp;#39;s not necessarily true is that some of these differences are objectively better. It&amp;#39;s largely a personal taste thing, and thus entirely subjective. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV:I don't think income equality is a problem.,"I don't think income inequality is a problem. We live in an era of abundance where countries as small as Estonia are capable of producing the food supply for the entire planet. There is no constraint when it comes to basic necessities such as food, clothing or shelter.  This is very different from the pre-world war II era when the world still did not have the technical prowess to meet the demands of the world. It is different from the world where Gallbraid hypothesized that population growth will exceed the rate at which we increasing output. He was wrong.  Today, the rich and poor don't fight for the same goods and services. Even though there is disparity between how much rich and poor earn, there is no pressure from the rich hogging resources such as food. If anything, the rich spend their income on lavish items such as yatches, cars and many other material items which although valuable are not necessary for survival.  So what is wrong with inequality other than it makes the have-nots jealous of the have's? I understand their are ethical issues with it, but what I'm more concerned with is, how income inequality can be bad for society, the economy or our general well being?   [Response to your replies]: A lot of you have pointed out that income equality leads to higher child mortality rates, health, etc. Although some of it is convincing, there is not enough evidence to support causation.  Others have pointed out that income equality is cause of poverty. This assumption is based on the fact that we have limited resources and when equality rises, the rich hog more resources while poor are left with none. Again, I must urge that there is lack of evidence in this theory as well. The economic pie has been growing and the rich has been simply getting a bigger slice, and there is a legitimate reason for it. Since the wave of globalization started, the wealthy got even wealthier because they had seen their markets grow far bigger than ever before. Not only did American business have customers in America but also had more buyers in Europe and Australia. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an individual&amp;#39;s wealth increases, the turnover (or velocity through the economy) of the dollars making up that wealth slows down, thus slowing the economy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Think of someone with a $40 billion fortune.  How many times a year would that $40 billion (or a portion of it) turn over in the economy compared to 1,000,000 people with $40,000?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, higher income inequality tends to slow the economy down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of income inequality decrease overall demand. The &amp;quot;haves&amp;quot;. Can afford to buy a large amount of goods and services, but they have no incentive to do so. If the money was spread out over more people then spending would be higher as more people would be able to afford what they desire. High levels of inequality is anethema to a mass production mass consumption economy as the consumption levels will be too low.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I recommend you watch the documentary Inequaliy for All.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"CMV: Child Protective Services (CPS), while a good concept, is virtually useless in practice","I have had many encounters with CPS (not for me, regarding others) and I am thoroughly and completely unimpressed.  Their job is to protect children yet I have never seen them actually do that.  Working in a hospital and being married to a nurse, I have had much contact with patients of all ages.  The lack of oversight in this area disgusts me.  Here is one example.  I knew many NICU nurses who talked on a regular basis of babies who were not only born early as a result of cocaine or other drug use, but actually went through withdrawals from cocaine.  They were so sensitive that if a nurse dropped a pen, the baby would wake up screaming and it would take hours to get them back down.  On more than one occasion, the nurses caught the parents still snorting WHILE AT THE HOSPITAL.  In all cases, this was documented ad nauseum and nothing was ever done.  There were also many parents who's baby had low birth weight due to marijuana and they would show up to the hospital reeking of pot.  More recently, I have met many home health nurses who have spoke of parents addicted to pain medications who would basically knock themselves out and leave the baby to scream from sitting in their own excrement for hours.  I have heard of rat infested homes, drug abuse, child abuse (actually slapping an infant)...even with documentation, the kids remain with their terrible parents.  With all this in mind, I firmly believe the CPS is a waste of resources.  Of course, this is all from anecdotal experience so maybe others have had better experiences.  All of my experience has been from various parts of Texas, if that matters.  EDIT: Wow! Thanks for all of the responses! I should have been more clear in my view...CPS, AS IT EXISTS NOW, is failing.  Many of you have pointed out the more resources are needed and after thinking I do agree.  I only know what I have seen and experienced and greatly appreciate the input many of you gave.  I will go through and award deltas when I get a break from work.  Edit 2: This has been very educational and I could give deltas to most of you...except for the one jackass. It's hard to see things when you have tunnel vision built from personal experience. Good evening all  Edit 3: If I miss anyone on a delta, apologies.  Many of you posed good arguments but there were A LOT of replies.  Edit 4: Trying to give out deltas but they keep kicking back. I'll get it figured out.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are things the government is good at and the private sector is bad at, there are things the government is bad at and the public sector is good at, and there are things that everyone is bad at.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Protecting children is something everyone is bad at.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For ordinary people CPS is fucking terrifying.  They literally have the authority to do the worst thing imaginable to you.  I think a lot of people would rather have a government agency that could rape them than take away their children.  And like all human institutions at times they overstep.  So when CPS comes calling normal people lawyer up and spend huge amounts of time, money, and worry obsessing over keeping their kids.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reality though is that it is hard to take a kid away from someone and for good reason.  Sure there are a lot of families looking to adopt babies but if a parent has proven they are unfit odds are they have done so by really screwing up the child.  No one wants to take in a screwed up child.  So they go to virtual storage facilities with &amp;quot;guardians&amp;quot; who are more guard than parent.  Faced with that choice the system often prefers to keep kids with parents even when they are screwy and so really doesn&amp;#39;t do much.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That said...  We need some kind of system to activate in the worst cases and CPS generally does a its job there.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It could be better, it should be better, we want it to be better, we just don&amp;#39;t know how to make it better.  In the meantime we need it for what little good it does do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot you&amp;#39;re not seeing here. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cps where I live also deals with food stamps, cash assistance and medical assistence. Taking the child from their unfit parents is only part of the institutions purpose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not see a lot of the good they do because your experiences seem to be related to infants. First of all, they need substantial evidence that the parents can&amp;#39;t get their shit together. The initial instance of abuse needs to be very severe for them to take the child away from that alone. They give the birth parents a chance to nut up amd change first. Second of all, they want to see if a family member can/will take on the load of raising the child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if cps was a perfect organization, the problem of too little foster homes/parents is still the biggest part of the problem. &lt;strong&gt;They have no where to put these kids&lt;/strong&gt;, I can&amp;#39;t stress that enough. And a lot of foster homes aren&amp;#39;t great, even worse than the homes these kids came from in a lot of cases. In my opinion, the amount of people wanting to adopt and the amount of foster homes needed evens out pretty well, but the issue is foster kids are rarely permanent, so I understand the risk involved, plus taking an older child with tons of issues from abuse is a huge load to take on. But regardless, there&amp;#39;s a stack of people who want kids and a stack of kids who need homes, and the closest thing I&amp;#39;ve come to a solution is in those stats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If this bugs you, which it should, maybe think about registering as a foster parent and urge your friends amd family to do the same. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I think that the stock market is full of capitalist leeches who produce no value yet siphon off capital from the market. CMV,"First, a disclaimer: I'm not an economist, and a lot about financial systems confuses me.  That said, I think financial markets are infested with capitalist leeches, who make money for doing nothing.   My understanding of how an ""investment"" should work is that you research trends and take an informed guess as to how a company will fair in the future, kind of like political donations; candidates with no chance aren't worth investing in, while in tight races a little investment can push one candidate over the top.  You take a little risk and earn a lot of profit when a company succeeds.   But this isn't how most professional trading is done.  More than half of all trading is [High-frequency trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading).  Basically computers watch the market, look for trends and near instantly respond to get a cut of the profit.  When a stock goes up, they jump in and buy lots of shares, and then immediately sell when the rise starts to cap. These trades happen within milliseconds, and they're getting faster as infrastructure improves.  What value do High frequency trades provide?  They are not ""investing"", they're leeching off other investors.  By buying and selling so quickly, they provide no capital for companies to use, as it's gone almost immediately.  I always hear about how important Wall Street is to the economy, but how important can it be if it's just a forum for huge companies to suck capital from smaller, legitimate investors?  Things can't be as bad as I'm imagining, please CMV.  Edit: It seems like HFT is the natural evolution of [Day trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_trading), which I see as similarly useless and exploitative.  I'm not too focused on HFT, more on rapid trading in general that doesn't fit the definition of an ""investment"", or any other conceptual flaws someone might identify.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only function of the stock market is to allocate capital efficiently to the most productive enterprises. Capital is redistributed by people buying shares in undervalued companies, and selling shares in overvalued companies. Every action which has the effect of allocating capital more productively, and moving a share price closer to where it should be is rewarded, whether it is based on a long-term or short-term strategy, or performed by a human or a machine.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are innumerable factors that influence the current and future value of a company, but a growing number of these can be (judging by the fact that HFT makes a profit) determined by computers. HFT is really just the logical extension of conventional day-trading, but the higher level of automation makes it faster. The market rewards being able to discover and take advantage of a market imbalance quickly before someone else corrects it, and HFT is a significant step forwards in removing the limiting factor (humans).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Used unwisely, HFT can lose you a lot of money. In the coming years, we should see less short-term volatility as computers globally correct stock prices many times per second. Other types of trading and investment will remain profitable until we make smart enough programs and computers to run them on: &lt;a href=""http://berglas.org/Articles/AIKillGrandchildren/AIKillGrandchildren.html""&gt;http://berglas.org/Articles/AIKillGrandchildren/AIKillGrandchildren.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who has actually worked in a high-frequency trading firm (full-disclosure: I only worked there for a summer, so more experienced traders may find that I may have made some mistakes), let me clear up a huge misconception:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most high-frequency firms don&amp;#39;t trade for &amp;quot;investment&amp;quot; or directionally. Most high-frequency firms are market-makers i.e. they are members of the exchanges they trade on, and are obligated to post buy and sell prices for the assets they cover at ALL times of day.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The purpose of market-making firms are to provide liquidity. By offering buy and sell prices at all times of the day, any investor hopping onto the market wanting to buy X or sell X &lt;strong&gt;will be able to do it&lt;/strong&gt;. He doesn&amp;#39;t need to wait for someone else to turn up at the exact same time as he does with the exact opposite side of the trade. The fact that market-makers post those prices all day enable the markets to function effectively so people know at all times how much they can buy or sell something for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But because they post prices at all times, they need to be especially careful that they don&amp;#39;t get picked off by the market, i.e. someone else with more information than them about the asset they&amp;#39;re covering comes and trades in a way that would be disadvantageous to them. Imagine you were posting buy and sell prices for Microsoft (MSFT). If someone hears about MSFT&amp;#39;s new earnings report seconds before you do, and they know the price is going to fall, they&amp;#39;re going to start massively selling to you before &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; realize that MSFT&amp;#39;s true price has fallen. Because you have to post prices on both sides of the market at all times, you are &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; vulnerable to getting picked off by anyone who can get more information than you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, imagine that you were posting currency prices all day. If the interest rates in one region/currency changes, it affects every other currency as well. As a market-maker, you need the ability to quickly change all your prices before anyone can hit you &lt;em&gt;or else&lt;/em&gt; you will lose a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thus, as a market-maker, you are extremely vulnerable. You have 2 options then. One is that you can widen your bid-ask spread by a lot. I.e. say you think MSFT is worth $33.00. You might normally offer to buy at $32.90 and sell as $33.10, and earn off that spread. If you&amp;#39;re really afraid of getting picked off by the market, you have to adjust the spread to compensate for that risk. You may widen the spread to $32.00 to buy and $34.00 to sell. Now, other investors lose out, cause instead of getting to buy at $33.10, they have to buy at $34.00, because the guy offering those market prices are so scared of losing out.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The other alternative is if you could change your prices faster than anyone else. That&amp;#39;s one of the main purposes of HFT - to be able to cancel (resting) orders and changes prices so you don&amp;#39;t get messed up by another trader. Some algorithms even go so far as to check news feeds or twitter feeds (which I think is somewhat silly), simply as additional sources of information to check if prices are going to move.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, the other reason for HFT is arbitrage. For example, MSFT is sold on different exchanges. Sometimes, the difference in orders on different exchanges might cause the prices at which MSFT is traded to differ. The other main purpose of HFT is to take advantage of these opportunities to cause all prices in the market to be consistent. If MSFT is trading $32.50-$33.00 on one exchange and $33.10-$33.20 on the other, an algorithm buys at $33.00 and sells at $33.10 for an instant profit. But that&amp;#39;s good for the market. Because after the HFT firm trades, the prices between the 2 exchanges will equalize, probably something in the $32.80-$33.00 on both exchanges. This is a good thing. Now investors, who have much less knowledge on how exchanges work, will not, say, stumble onto the firm exchange trying to sell at $32.50, when he could get a much better price on the latter exchange. The HFT firm, by its own profit-seeking activities, ensures that whenever you step onto any market, you will get a fair price.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, as an ending note, some people will mention the &amp;quot;big events&amp;quot; of HFT to prove that it&amp;#39;s terrible. Like the flash crash. Or the KCG meltdown. I just want to point out some things.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Notice how there was almost no ramifications of the flash crash? Because when the markets recover quickly. Within minutes of the &amp;quot;wrong prices&amp;quot;, which were spurred by an ACTUAL and LARGE order that moved the market, prices were back in line with their history. The reason for this is that you have other trading firms that swoop in and push prices back to where they should be.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;So KCG lost all its capital by letting a rogue algorithm run for FORTY-FIVE MINUTES before someone shut it off. At that point it&amp;#39;s not even a HFT problem. Also, notice that there were no economic ramifications again. Only KCG&amp;#39;s shareholders lost money. And their loss meant everyone else trading against them won.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some people also think that HFT firms can manipulate prices by shoving and canceling orders. But exchanges have a strong incentive to ensure that no price manipulation happens, and can go so far as to ban firms from trading on them if they suspect foul-play.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, there are some legitimate concerns to have about HFT. Some economists find that at the current level of capitalization and expense, it&amp;#39;s more rent-seeking than liquidity provision. Well, that&amp;#39;s just wasteful, not harmful. Another criticism is that current regulation does not effectively regulate HFTs. That is also true, especially with HFTs being able to hide behind the &amp;quot;black-box&amp;quot; algorithms. That said, these are minor issues that do not significantly impact the market. HFT will almost never affect you as an investor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;tl;dr People tend to misunderstand who does high-frequency trading and why, and are afraid of it because it sounds mysterious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I do not believe photography takes a lot of skill. CMV,"I used to be really big into photography as well as my brother.  However, after thinking it over, I really only think its about timing and how still you can hold a camera.  Don't get me wrong, I am not bashing photography, but I just don't believe a large amount of skill is required. Please try to CMV if you have  some insight.  EDIT: Damn you guys really put an effort into this i really appreciate it.  Turns out there were many aspects i didn't look into all that much.  Though i still will be critical of the growing fad that buying a camera makes one a photographer, I will definitely look at it with far better eyes.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This completely depends on what form of photography you are talking about, for example a friend of mine has just completed a degree in photo journalism which very much depends on being at the right place at the right time (and being able to take a clear shot). As opposed to artistic photography.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The thing i find interesting with photography is that anyone can &amp;#39;learn&amp;#39; how to do it, but the ability is very much a natural thing i think. Some of the best photographers were taking photos from when they were very young, before they began &amp;#39;learning&amp;#39; the fundamentals or technique, and im sure you can tell they had ability from them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The most important thing with photography is the framing (/composition). ANYONE can point and click, but what 99% of people dont achieve is a picture that is pleasing to the eye. That is the difference between a photographer and a person who owns a camera.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(As a side note, i have a lot of friends who own all the expensive kit and call themselves photographers but are just awful.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know that saying: give a man a fish and he&amp;#39;ll eat for a day, but teach that same man how to fish and he&amp;#39;ll feed himself for a lifetime? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well think about it like this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sell a hundred men fish and you can make a fair amount in an afternoon. Teach a different hundred how to fish over the course of a year (assuming its not in the name of charity) and you&amp;#39;ll find yourself far wealthier over time than you would have been that evening you sold 100 fish.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;__&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, I can make my response addressing photography.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When photographical evidence upon review suggests a keen eye and a better trained pair of hands, the rest of us as it were, take notice, and the photographer can begin to make money for himself. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition, specialists out there are creating and perfecting better lenses capable of producing sharper images, and thus more expensive equipment. The crop of Average photographers with $200 cameras or smartphones pale in comparison to these better equipped - AND trained, photographers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Skill in photography, or fly fishing, or any hobby marked by relative ease of entry, still exists alongside the elements of difficulty that make us regard those at the top with adoration. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once a certain group reaches a certain point, however, they realize they can make money providing expertise to the inexperienced. Paying for all those things, being squeezed at the bottom in pursuit of the interest you follow may seem underhanded and dishonorable, yes, but the photographers held in high esteem are teaching the rest of us how to fish, and so it is. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyone can go and purchase a Lionel train set that goes around the christmas tree or the ceiling of a packed family restaurant. But having a detailed layout with fake trees  and soccer fields, right next to the miniature waterfall and downtown post office, that  takes effort. And when someone like that wishes to showcase their work, with all those miniature details and fixings, they call a professional photographer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are the ones that know the basics, like pointing and clicking, but then there are the best ones, that can capture the essence of life in any situation like a rare orchid deep within the damp recesses of some remote forest or the child clinging onto a doll, a slim glimmer of hope amidst the ruins of a war-torn landscape. These are the traveling photographers that race across the constantly shifting, motion filled world to capture and immortalize mere seconds for the ages. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;m afraid that &lt;em&gt;that alone&lt;/em&gt;, requires a lot of skill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: I don't believe in aliens.,"My boyfriend and I got into a debate about whether aliens are flying around our galaxy and solar system and entering our planet.  I argued that if there were aliens flying around in outer space, even if they're not entering Earth, we would have heard about them from scientists. Also the planets don't have any evidence of life except for Mars having signs of water. I admitted I don't know enough about other galaxies to deny or defend their existence.   He says that astronauts and scientists aren't allowed to acknowledge their existence or else they would lose their jobs. He said that even airline pilots can't acknowledge their existence without losing their job.   I agreed that there's a chance that unintelligent life exists on other planets, maybe even other solar systems since water (or evidence of what used to be water) was found on Mars. I believe microbes and maybe amoebas can possibly exist but I don't believe there's intelligent life on any planet not any solar system except ours.   CMV!  Edit: TIL that there are 100 billion other galaxies and 1800 planets in our solar system that don't orbit the sun. Disclaimer: I haven't Googled yet to verify those. A lot of people gave me a lot to Google.  That being said, my view isn't completely changed but I'm also not 100% sure that I was right in believing we're alone in the universe.   Good job guys. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very likely that extraterrestrial life exists, possibly even within our own solar system.  You&amp;#39;re right about Mars being the only other &lt;em&gt;planet&lt;/em&gt; with a chance of supporting life, but there are several moons in our solar system that scientists have speculated could support single-cell or even complex life forms (see &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Titan""&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; and Europa - &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)#Potential_for_extraterrestrial_life""&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)#Potential_for_extraterrestrial_life&lt;/a&gt; (the link doesn&amp;#39;t like reddit formatting).  Outside of our solar system, it seems almost impossible for life to be completely nonexistent.  We&amp;#39;ve confirmed the existence of almost 1800 planets that don&amp;#39;t orbit our sun, and there are undoubtedly many more that we can&amp;#39;t detect because our telescopes aren&amp;#39;t precise enough.  Earth-like planets are also generally harder to detect than gas giants because they&amp;#39;re so much smaller.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As to why we haven&amp;#39;t detected any signs of intelligent extraterrestrials and why they haven&amp;#39;t visited us yet, that&amp;#39;s an unanswered question (see &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox""&gt;the Fermi Paradox&lt;/a&gt;).  It&amp;#39;s extremely hard for the human mind to comprehend the insane distances between the stars.  It goes without saying that travel between them would be extremely impractical and astronomically expensive.  You then have to think about what would motivate an alien race to come and visit us.  Our solar system doesn&amp;#39;t have anything particularly special when it comes to mineral resources.  Any species with the ability to travel here could undoubtedly maintain its own food, water, and fuel supplies by using materials that are much more accessible.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Really, the only conceivable reason is to contact us, and then you have to consider how long we&amp;#39;ve been sending out detectable radio signals.  The first high-powered radio broadcast was during the height of the Nazi regime, only 70 years ago.  That means that any alien species would have to be less than 70 lightyears away to know that we even exist, and then to get to us they would have to organize a major interstellar space mission and travel all the way here.  Contrary to what science fiction tells us, space travel is unlikely to ever be what I would call convenient, and there isn&amp;#39;t really much reason to come here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Basically, we don&amp;#39;t know if there&amp;#39;s intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.  However, we can say that there isn&amp;#39;t anything on Earth that would make it more able to support intelligent life that doesn&amp;#39;t exist on a multitude of other planets in our galaxy alone.  Even places that we would normally consider completely inhospitable can support life (see &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile""&gt;extremophiles&lt;/a&gt;).  It seems statistically impossible that we&amp;#39;re alone, even if we haven&amp;#39;t met yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can that easily believe in microbial life elsewhere in the universe, then you should easily be able to entertain the idea of intelligent life, given the size of the Universe. The Universe is so large that our human brain is incapable of comprehending the size. Even if you were to write down the size in some form of measurement, that you could read and physically see how large it is, there is still a good chance you won&amp;#39;t comprehend it fully. The Universe that we can see contains an estimated 100 billion galaxies, each containing hundreds of billions of stars of their own. Even in our own neighborhood, inside our own galaxy, we have found examples of exoplanets residing in the habitable region to their host star. Given that, there are probably many more in our own galaxy. If the conditions are right, life thrives fast (relative to the age of the universe) and tends to have a snowball effect. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says that astronauts and scientists aren&amp;#39;t allowed to acknowledge their existence or else they would lose their jobs. He said that even airline pilots can&amp;#39;t acknowledge their existence without losing their job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is where I would heavily disagree with him. The Universe is so large that it is likely that intelligent life resides in independent &amp;quot;islands&amp;quot; that are simply too far apart to ever find each other. Even if some intelligent life form figured out how to travel at the fastest possible speed (speed of light), it would still take billions of years to travel across the universe. If we were to assume that other intelligent life isn&amp;#39;t that dissimilar from humans, there is no chance they could reasonably travel farther than neighboring stars, let alone other galaxies. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s think about if aliens have in fact come to this planet. Why would they have any interest in anything we could possibly have? If they were able to successfully travel across the galaxy, they are insanely more advanced than we are. It would be analogous to humans staring at ants building ant hills. What&amp;#39;s the purpose? Maybe to learn, sure, but at that point they are well aware of other intelligent life in the universe. Which also crushes the idea of alien spacecraft crash landing on Earth. To me, it&amp;#39;s just absurd to believe this. We&amp;#39;re talking about a hyper-advanced alien race that is capable of safely traveling enormous distances across an extremely harsh and large environment, they surely know aviation to the point of it being obsolete to them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: People should stop pronouncing English loanwords as if they're speaking their native language.,"First of all, let me be clear that this is not some 'speak 'murican', anti-immigrant screed. Multiculturalism is the way of the world, and I'm all for it. Plus, immigrants bring fresh ideas (and delicious food). Not to mention that English is an insanely difficult language even for native speakers, so I'm not going to begrudge people for speaking it with an accent.  What I do have a problem with is people who speak English fluently and with an American accent suddenly lapsing into another accent to say a specific word. This mainly arises with Latinos using identity markers ('latino', 'chicano') or foods ('quesadilla'). However, most of these words have been adopted into English as true loanwords; English speakers understand them and use them often. But I often hear people on the news, e.g. a policy analyst of Latin-American extraction, using words like ""latino"" with a Spanish lilt that sounds (to me) out-of-place and exaggerated.  Suddenly switching to another accent, at best, is confusing, as it takes the listener's brain that extra millisecond to adapt to a new style of speaking. At worst, it sounds kind of pretentious and exclusionary.  I'm not arguing that we should completely anglify these words -- I don't want to hear someone pronounce 'quesadilla' with a hard L sound, like the grandma in Napoleon Dynamite. Rather I think we should treat Spanish loanwords like we do words like ""kindergarden"" (German), ""sake"" (Japanese), or ""joie de vivre"" (French) -- try as best we can to respect the original pronunciation, but maintain our typical accent when saying them.  Doing otherwise is just kind of disrespectful. To illustrate: I am a reasonably proficient Spanish speaker and have spent a lot of time in Spanish-speaking countries. Once I was speaking with a local (edit: in Spanish) and used the word ""iPod"", which left him scratching his head. I couldn't figure out why -- I knew, in fact, that he owned one too. Then it hit me -- I was pronouncing the 'i' sound like the English ""eye"", which is a confusing sound for Spanish speakers, especially when surrounded by Spanish words. Once I pronounced it as ""ee-Pod"", he immediately knew what I was talking about. From then on, when speaking Spanish, I always try to 'spanishify' the pronunciation of vowel sounds to avoid these kind of misunderstandings.  So CMV.  edit: bedtime for this OP, but thank you so much to everyone who participated!

When you say &amp;quot;quesadilla&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;joie de vivre&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Fahrvergnügen,&amp;quot; you approximate the original word as best you can, because for that moment, you are no longer speaking English.

CMV: Natural Rights do not exist.,"I believe natural rights, i.e. *""...those not contingent upon the laws, customs, or beliefs of any particular culture or government, and therefore universal and inalienable...""* do not exist.  I believe all rights given to any human are social constructs, produced by society from moral structures determined by a multitude of factors. However, all of these rights can be removed in some way, and are not somehow intrinsically given to a human at birth.

If you want the best car possible, you build it out of metal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the same way, if you want the best life possible, people have to acknowledge each others inalienable human rights.

I think college is highly overrated and that the people of my country (USA) don't have their priorities in order. CMV,"All my life I have been told to get good grades, just so I can make it to the next grade, and so on, eventually leading to doing well in high school so that I can go to college, earn a degree, and get a good job.   More often than not, I see and hear people talking about how they do not have a job pertaining to their degree, yet everyone seems to be pushing college on their children. What is the point of spending thousands of dollars and building up debt just so that I can get a job in a field that doesn't require my degree?  To go further than that, it seems to be the norm in America to get a job and work ~8 hours a day just so that you can have money to live comfortably and/or buy things to enjoy in the time you are not working. Seeing as you are asleep for roughly 8 hours, that leaves 16 hours that you are awake per day. If you are working the 8 hours mentioned earlier, then you are left with just 8 hours for free time. The only thing is, your only duties are not your job, so you have to spend time taking care of your house and children if you have them.   It's important to know that I make music. That is what I enjoy doing, performing music. I can get gigs, and they will probably only ever cover my rent and living costs, but I get to spend all of my working time doing what I love, as opposed to some random job. I would much rather skip college and just live with my band, splitting rent and living off of what we love to do. Why should I pursue anything else?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;#39;ve got two CMVs here: the one in your title and the one in your description. The one in your title is a generalization about people and should be pretty easy to change - people have different priorities, and a lot of priorities have college as a prerequisite (law for instance). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the second one, why should you go to college - well, in the field of music there are a ton of specialties that you won&amp;#39;t really be able to develop if you don&amp;#39;t at least take some classes (sound engineering comes to mind). In college, you&amp;#39;ll be exposed to professionals in your field. Maybe your professor will know people from famous bands and would be able to hook you up with an awesome mentor. Maybe your school has a pub and pays students to do gigs there. Maybe the music department has a full blown recording studio that they rent out to students for free. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;See, you have this idea in your head about college being this &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s the same everywhere. You&amp;#39;re thinking college is like high school. Well, it&amp;#39;s not. There are hundreds and hundreds of colleges to choose from, each with their own perks, strengths, and costs. You can pick the one you want to go to, you can make that decision based on its faculty, and the classes it offers, and its location, and its facilities, etc. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In order to have the most number of options, however, you need to have that baseline: GPA + SATs. No one really cares how well you do in high school. They tell you to get good grades because they want you to have as many options as possible after high school. So that when you can choose between splitting rent and living with your buddies, and any number of colleges, it&amp;#39;s actually a choice you&amp;#39;re able to make.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your own priorities may be quite different than others your age. You have something that satisfies you and makes you happy. Good. This doesn&amp;#39;t mean there isn&amp;#39;t a line around the corner of students with no such pasttime, who are rudderless and without a clear idea if what they want to do or even, and this is relevant, &lt;em&gt;what their possibilities are.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At its best the university should broaden one&amp;#39;s horizons, expose students to a world of topics and fields they would otherwise never know about. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I will say though that I&amp;#39;m not of the mind that university should be solely about &amp;#39;getting a job.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
Vegas or vegetarians who believe meat eaters needless kill animals while the vegan/vegetarian community do not are wrong. CMV,"I have seen a few posts where somebody has held the opposite view to this and I have never once seen a response to any argument so I figured I'd post my position and hope somebody can help me understand the other side.  First, I am not saying that we should torture and kill animals just for pure sadistic pleasure, thats fucked up and stupid. However, I feel like just about 99.9% of Americans are exploiting animals for personal gain or unnecessary luxuries.  Not to generalize, but often times many vegans have given me shit for eating meat. Saying things like the life of the animal that i am eating is far more important than me having a tasty meal. However, the person who is giving me shit lives in a house, drives a car, uses electricity, all activities that harm animals. Houses are made from wood, the production of which leads to deforestation which is bad for the animal kingdom. Driving a car uses gasoline which produces pollutants when they are created and used which kills animals. A decent percentage of electricity is created through coal which causes the death of animals through largely the same methods. So I value the life of animals less than the luxuries that they bring like sustenance and electricity. I wonder why a number of vegans feel like they do not abuse animals in any way when they hold the luxury to go on the internet and look at animals over the life of said animals.  TL;DR Anybody reading this is responsible for the suffering and death of animals, those who live on the grid and give meat eaters shit for killing animals are giant hypocrites.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think most people would agree that there would be less of an environmental impact if we didn&amp;#39;t do a lot of the things that we do. The issue here is that vegans/vegetarians concerned with animal welfare are aware that they do need to sometimes unintentionally harm animals, but if it&amp;#39;s easy to simply do one thing for them, such as not eat them, then that&amp;#39;s a pretty simple solution to help not kill a large amount of them. We wouldn&amp;#39;t have farms crammed with miserable and mistreated animals if nobody ate them. We wouldn&amp;#39;t have to breed them to die for human consumption. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just for reference: I was a vegetarian for 6 months, now I eat meat. I wanted to understand the reasons for not eating meat and I wanted to learn to cook for my vegetarian friends. I recommend trying it for a bit if you really want to learn about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious why you characterize torturing and killing animals for &amp;quot;pure, sadistic pleasure&amp;quot; as immoral, and then go on to suggest that making any moral judgment of another&amp;#39;s treatment of animals is unfair if the judge is in even some, circuitous way engaged in behavior which results in animal suffering. In so doing, aren&amp;#39;t you drawing as arbitrary a line as the judgmental vegans who bother you so much? I&amp;#39;m about to use slavery as an analogy, and I hope you don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m implying I find your argument as reprehensible as that might make it seem, but I&amp;#39;ve found it can help me make my argument more clearly. Say that someone, themselves a slave owner, argued that while slaves ought not be mistreated for pleasure, owning and using them to one&amp;#39;s benefit can&amp;#39;t be argued to be immoral if the abolitionists making that judgment engage in behavior which, after a drawn out and tenuous chain of cause and effect, results in slave suffering. Does an abolitionist&amp;#39;s use of a railroad, the construction of which was achieved in part by slave labor, mean that their argument that slavery is immoral is invalid? I think most of us would agree that it doesn&amp;#39;t. Most of us would recognize that with an institution as insidious and pervasive as slavery was, the people of its era couldn&amp;#39;t possibly help but engage at some point in an activity that could be said to contribute to the suffering of slaves. What percentage of an individual slave&amp;#39;s suffering could you reasonably attribute to that one abolitionist? Thousandths of a percent? Maybe. When you sit down to a meal of a whole rotisserie chicken, what percentage of that chicken&amp;#39;s suffering is attributable to you? It lived, likely in horrible conditions, and died, probably painfully, so that you could consume its flesh. Subtracting the use of its less palatable tissues (head, feathers, feet, organs), would you say you purchased, if not entirely consumed, about 85% of the bird? The point is to do as little harm as possible, and I&amp;#39;d say being about 85% responsible vs thousandths of a percent isn&amp;#39;t even worth comparing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"Based on cable news ratings, I believe that informed people prefer Fox news, and uniformed people don't watch the news. CMV.","I googled “cable news ratings” and found that Fox News overwhelmingly leads in ratings. I am a conservative, so I am biased, but I really find this interesting. Could it be that since there are like 5 “liberal” networks vs. one conservative network that the ratings spread is unequal? Or is it that conservatives watch the news more than liberals?   It is clear to me that there are informed voters and uninformed voters. I have nothing against an informed liberal voter. I know many, and they study the issues, and feel the way they feel, and vote accordingly. That is democracy. What peeves me is that there are so many that vote that have no clue as to what the issues are, and don’t even have an opinion when asked. They just vote based on…I don’t even know…whoever is most popular at the time. Whoever their social circle tells them to vote for. That is screwing up our Country I believe.   I have a gal friend at work who in 2012 was asking me what the difference between liberals and conservatives was. I did NOT take the advantage to bash liberals. I simply sent her to a website that explained the differences of opinion on the major issues between liberals and conservatives. I explained that most people weren’t loyal to all the views of one particular party, but usually shared some views from each party.   She was stunned that most of her views were conservative. I was stunned when she said she would vote democrat anyway because that’s what her family and friends were doing. Case in point.   What do the ratings really say? I think that the informed prefer Fox and the uniformed prefer ignorance. I am really open minded, and willing to change my view. So…change it.   **EDIT:** Here's what I'm getting out of this. In the words of Mark Twain: If you don't read the news, you are uninformed. If you do read the news, you are misinformed.  ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure from your OP WHY you think informed people prefer Fox news.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your posted that Fox has very high ratings, and some stories about uninformed people you&amp;#39;ve met. I can&amp;#39;t for the life of me figure out how your conclusion follows from those things. Can you clarify what actually led you to your conclusion?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re just looking for reasons why you shouldn&amp;#39;t draw this conclusion based on cable ratings, consider that &amp;quot;not watching the news&amp;quot; is not the same as &amp;quot;being uninformed&amp;quot;. The internet and even good old fashioned newspapers are both ways to stay up to date.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, many of Fox News highly rated shows are opinion pieces. So only a subset of &amp;quot;watching fox news&amp;quot; even counts as &amp;quot;watching the news&amp;quot; at all. Another reason to be cautious about what conclusions you draw from those ratings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: I think Benn Wyatt is right that calzones are superior to Pizza in almost every way.,"Benn Wyatt made several good points about the virtues of calzones. For those that, god forbid, don't already know:  &gt;[A calzone (/kælˈzoʊni/, US /kælˈzoʊneɪ/, or /kælˈzoʊn/, UK /kælˈtsoʊni/; Italian: [kalˈtsoːne], ""stocking"" or ""trouser"") is an Italian filled oven bread, originating in Naples, and shaped as a folded pizza. It resembles a half-moon and is made of salted bread dough. A typical calzone is baked in an oven and stuffed with salami or ham, mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan or pecorino cheese, amalgamated with an egg.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calzone)   Calzones have several virtues over pizza.  1) Calzones are easy to transport cleanly. By virtue of being surrounded by dough, no sauce or toppings are going to spill during transportation, making carrying a calzone a largely risk free proposition.  2) Calzones maintain their temperature better over distances because their encompassing crust acts as insulation for the pipping hot toppings in the center.   3) As any New Yorker will tell you, the proper way to eat pizza is to fold it in half with each end of the crust pointing upwards, and the crust itself enveloping the toppings. Sound familiar? It should, because it's a calzone!  4) Calzones can be filled with more ingredients than a typical pizza by virtue of their design. Since they are a stuffed bread, there is little risk of excess toppings threatening the structural integrity of the calzone. With a pizza, the more you put on, the greater the risk to the integrity of the pizza, particularly when you take an individual slice. Ever had ingredients slide off the top of a pizza slice just as you were about to take a bite? Sounds like a bit of a food engineering problem. Allow me to introduce the solution: calzones.   5) Calzones reduce wast. Calzones can be baked more readily to sizes fitting an individual portion. Personal pizzas are possible, but are rarely seen in the pizza world. Pizza is a group food, and most restaurants provide that option. To help meet individual needs, slices are offered. However, this introduces the problem of waste. If slices remain unsold, what remains of a pizza will inevitably be thrown out. This is wasteful! Calzones don't have that problem. Calzone's are generally made to order for the individual in a size an individual can eat. One calzone for one person. No waste!  To me, the answer is clear. We should become a calzone nation. Thank you Benn Wyatt for revealing the truth.   **Edit: So far, several good points have been made, and they have come perilously close to driving me to a heresy. I am going to just round them up here in one place**:  1) Presentation. Pizza can be presented visually in ways a calzone cannot.  2) Preparation. Pizza can be cooked in ways that produce an ideal outcome in terms of flavor a way that calzones cannot because the toppings are directly exposed to heat.  3) Pizza is a superior social food as it is more easily shared.   4) Pizza can at least *approximate* some of the advantages of a calzone by folding a slice in half.    5) Calzones have to have more bread relative to the number of toppings (this is disputed, but if true it is certainly a point in pizza's favor)  6) Moisture buildup is a problem if you add too many moist toppings into a calzone. This prevents certain combinations in a calzone that can be put on a pizza, and is why many times sauces are delivered as a separate item in a ramekin.  7) Calzones cool slower and less evenly, making it difficult to eat on the spot, and meaning that you will get an uneven flavor experience.   These are all very good points. I will have to think this over more. If I change my mind, I will start deep dishing out deltas.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Except when they do spring a leak.  Calzones have a weak spot all around one side where the seam is.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2)  Calzones take bloody forever to cool and there is no way to tell just how hot the middle is without just biting into it and hoping you don&amp;#39;t get burnt (I always get burnt).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4) The bread is not as good as pizza crust.  It&amp;#39;s usually dry and papery on top and not fluffy and yeasty and crispy like pizza crust.  Also, there is not way to get &amp;quot;oven spring&amp;quot; from a calzone.  That is when the crust is put into a very hot oven and quickly puffs up with steam pockets.  It gives the bread a much better texture, making it both crispy and fluffy in all the right places.  Calzones need to cook more slowly so that the topping heats all the way through, which means the bread is denser and the gluten won&amp;#39;t form properly and it will be dryer in the thick spots.  That means the crust will either be too chewy or too cakey, and cakey dough isn&amp;#39;t as strong as a regular pizza crust folded in half.  Also, the toppings don&amp;#39;t brown.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever had ingredients slide off the top of a pizza slice just as you were about to take a bite?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Actually I haven&amp;#39;t.  I guess I&amp;#39;m just skilled that way.  But I have had a calzone blow a leak out the back end while I bit into the front.  With calzones you always have to monitor your bread to topping ratio to make sure you have enough both bread and filling from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;5) Calzones are not as easy to reheat.  They are too thick to cook evenly in a microwave so either the crust goes hard or the middle is cold.  Usually both.  Pizza can be easily adapted to different sized appetites.  I&amp;#39;m not a big person and I have a small appetite, so most calzones would still take me two sittings to finish.  And half of a day old calzone is not as good as half a day old pizza.  With pizza, I can take as much or as little as I want and have enough to have cold pizza for breakfast (who doesn&amp;#39;t love cold pizza for breakfast??)  Pizza slices are deliberately cut uneven so people can take the size that they want.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good pizza has a few notable characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A perfect crust.  It should have just the right amount of chew, and just the right amount of char.  This is quite difficult to achieve, and most pizza restaurants fail at it.  To do it properly requires an extremely hot oven; it is almost impossible if burdened by excessive moisture or toppings.  A calzone will be unlikely to replicate this, because it&amp;#39;s too thick and moist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flavorful sauce.  A calzone can do this just as well as a pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheese with just the right stretchiness, toastedness, etc.  Now strictly speaking this is optional and a great pizza does not need cheese.  However, many/most of us love cheese on our pizza with just the right level of toasted maillard reaction goodness; a calzone cannot deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(optional) toppings.  A great pizza needs no toppings, but many of us like some.  A calzone can have more, but a pizza that depends on delicious toppings to drown out a subpar crust (California, I&amp;#39;m looking at you) is not the ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A great New York pizza may be folded in half to eat, but it is never cooked folded in half.  If you can obtain all the benefits of a calzone (without its drawbacks) by simply folding a New York pizza, then that pizza is superior to the calzone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: ""Pay-it-forward"" chains are pointless and unnecessary.","You've all heard or experienced going to a coffee shop, ordering your drink and finding out the person ahead of you has paid for your drink.

"CMV:If Supreme Court Justices actually did what they were supposed to do, virtually every decision would be a 9-0 vote. The fact that many votes - especially on ""hot button"" issues - are 5-4 votes indicates that the Justices are deciding politically, rather than simply interpreting the Constitution","[This](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2012/06/01/so-much-for-politics-more-than-half-of-supreme-court-decisions-unanimous/) is somewhat dated information, but it generally speaks to my point.  Even though that article's overall view counters my view, it states:  &gt; With 58 decisions in so far, 30, or 52%, have been 9-0 votes, well above the 30% in 2007 and the five-year average of 39% for unanimous opinions. Another 12% were 8-1, compared with a five-year average of 10%. In all, 87% of the decisions so far have garnered more consensus than the 5-4 split usually associated with conservative decisions in the court run by Chief Justice John Roberts. The five-year average for 5-4 votes is 24%.  While the Constitution is certainly an ambiguous document if you're looking for ambiguity, it isn't really that complex and is generally straight forward.  And it should be especially straight forward to the greatest legal minds in the country (if we are able to assume that that group includes the Supreme Court Justices).  So, if all the Justices are doing is interpreting the Constitution and telling us what it means, there should be very little dissension.  Virtually every vote should be 9-0, with a few 8-1 decisions thrown in.  A 5-4 decision should be virtually unheard of.  Having so many votes that are *not* 9-0, indicates that the Justices are either (a) not very good at interpreting the Constitution (i.e., they aren't really qualified for the job) or (b) they are basing their votes upon their own personal and/or political opinions, rather than an interpretation of the Constitution.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the Constitution is certainly an ambiguous document if you&amp;#39;re looking for ambiguity, it isn&amp;#39;t really that complex and is generally straight forward.

Though the Constitution is straightforward on many things, you admit there&amp;#39;s some ambiguity.  But the Supreme Court only hears a small number of cases - those for which they&amp;#39;re needed.  It makes sense that the ones that fall into the ambiguous parts of the Constitution, though a small portion of all the cases, are a big portion of the ones that actually go to the Supreme Court.  Even of the cases petitioned to SCOTUS, they only take 1% - the ones with interesting, hard legal questions&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, not everything the Supreme Court does is Constitutional law, they also do statutory interpretation, review regulations, etc (though this doesn&amp;#39;t change your or my point really).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, can you give an example of some cases you think are straightforward but the Court&amp;#39;s divided on?  (I&amp;#39;d probably agree on some...I think the Court&amp;#39;s political &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt;, I just think less so than you think).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 5-4 decision should be virtually unheard of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A 5-4 decision &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; virtually unheard of. You&amp;#39;re looking at the wrong number.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;About &lt;a href=""http://www.supremecourt.gov/faq.aspx#faqgi9""&gt;10,000 cases are appealed to the Supreme Court every year&lt;/a&gt;. The Supreme Court hears about 75-80 of them. I&amp;#39;ll round up to 100 for easy math.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That means that 99.9% of cases are, in effect, 9-0 decisions to let the lower court rulings stand. The SCOTUS only hears cases where there&amp;#39;s significant ambiguity, or disagreement among lower courts, or occasionally if it&amp;#39;s just a particularly pressing national issue concerning fundamental constitutional questions. And given that, the fact that they still come to unanimous agreement 30-50% of the time is pretty impressive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A further part of the issue is that we the public tend to only pay attention to highly controversial cases where there&amp;#39;s a left/right split, and we see the same 4 judges voting one way and the other 4 voting the other way in a predictable fashion. But when you look at all the cases they vote on, not every 5-4 split involves the same group of judges.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And even on the ideological cases, that&amp;#39;s kind of to be expected. They&amp;#39;re political appointees. They&amp;#39;re chosen because they share an ideology with the President that appointed them. There are multiple legitimate ways to interpret the constitution, some of which lend themselves to conservative outcomes and others to liberal outcomes. Even if a minority of all legal minds hold a particular interpretation, they&amp;#39;ll still be appointed because they hold that interpretation. Their decisions aren&amp;#39;t politically motivated; in fact they&amp;#39;re just applying their beliefs consistently.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As much as I&amp;#39;m not a fan of the conservative wing of the court, the SCOTUS remains one of the better functioning parts of our government, IMHO.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: I think supermarkets should start adding a fee for using express lanes if you have more than the stated items.,"Because my idea of beating the customers silly seems to be unpopular...  If the sign says 12 items, and you bring 13, you should be assessed a 5 dollar fee. 5 bucks for every item over 12. If a register scans a 13th item, automatic 5 bucks. 14th? Another 5. And so on. Post signs, don't hide it in the fine print.  As I see it, this would affect:  1) people that can't count, and thus probably shouldn't be in the supermarket unattended to anyways.  2) People that don't care enough to count their items - well, maybe this will start speeding up the process.  3) Assholes who don't care about anyone else - fuck them anyways.  I really don't see a downside to this.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

All of this would take time and slow down the line, so it would be counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#39;m not sure if there&amp;#39;s a need for such a plan.  Are one or two extra items in the express lane really putting a significant, quantifiable burden on other customers?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Express lanes themselves are a waste of time, and they slow the process down for everyone. The problem lies with allowing people to pick their own lines. Everyone should be in one line and when a register is available they move to it. This prevents a single person who has a problem, say a price check, to delay an entire line. They just delay a single register. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2009/what-i-would-do-with-this-groceries/""&gt;http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2009/what-i-would-do-with-this-groceries/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The express lane isn’t faster. The manager backed me up on this one. You attract more people holding fewer total items, but as the data shows above, when you add one person to the line, you’re adding 48 extra seconds to the line length (that’s “tender time” added to “other time”) without even considering the items in her cart. Meanwhile, an extra item only costs you an extra 2.8 seconds. Therefore, you’d rather add 17 more items to the line than one extra person! I can’t believe I’m dropping exclamation points in an essay on grocery shopping but that’s how this stuff makes me feel.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re imposing an arbitrary rule which would not in fact speed up services. Your speed in a line or through a checkout is not determined by the number of your items but more on the number of people in the line more people means more problems which means more delays. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"I believe people should be able to retire by the time they are 62 years old, and that their employers should be paying them well enough to do so. CMV","I don't think people should have to work well into or after their 60s and that employers should be compensating them enough either through actual compensation or through some kind of retirement investment assistance like a 401K in addition to social security no matter what you do for work. If you work hard all your life, you should be able to retire before you are too old to enjoy it.   And before you start the argument that it would bankrupt most companies I'd like to remind you of the statistics that show how much money most CEOs of big corporations make compared with their low wage workers who actually do most of the work to get the company it's profits.   http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2012/ceo-pay-ratios/  http://money.cnn.com/2012/04/19/news/economy/ceo-pay/  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-leadership/post/crazy-data-point-of-the-day-how-much-ceo-vs-worker-pay-has-grown/2012/05/11/gIQArUISIU_blog.html  EDIT: I've had some great and convincing responses. Thanks for making me feel better about our financial situation in the U.S.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe people should be able to retire by the time they are 62 years old, and that their employers should be paying them well enough to do so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Would it change your view if I told you that already happens?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take an average &amp;quot;low wage&amp;quot; worker.  Federal minimum wage in the United States is currently $7.75/hr (I think).  But that certainly shouldn&amp;#39;t be the lifetime wage of someone who &amp;quot;works hard all their life&amp;quot;.  If you&amp;#39;re making minumum wage when you&amp;#39;re 30-35, that&amp;#39;s a problem with &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, not a problem with the employer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s assume a typical &amp;quot;low wage&amp;quot; worker averages $10/hour throughout their lifetime (for &lt;a href=""http://ycharts.com/indicators/average_hourly_earnings""&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;, the current average hourly wage in the US is over $24.00).  On a 40 hour work week, that&amp;#39;s $20,800/year or $1,733/month.  Can a person retire on that income at age 62?  I think the answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The stock market has historically averaged an 8% return over the long term.  At that rate, if you can put in just $54/month (about 3% of your paycheck) for 44 years (from the time you&amp;#39;re 18 until 62), you&amp;#39;ll have around $262,000 when you turn 62.  And if you continue to earn 8% on that, you&amp;#39;ll be earning $1,737/month in income - which replaces that $1,733 monthly income that you previously had from working.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So then the only question is whether or not people can live on $1,679/month ($1,733 in wages less $54 going to savings).  Obviously, different regions have different costs of living, but it is certainly possible to live in the United States on $1,679/month.  If you disagree with that, it is another discussion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When it comes to being able to retire at 62, &lt;strong&gt;the problem isn&amp;#39;t that workers aren&amp;#39;t getting paid enough, it is that they have other priorities that are more important to them throughout their working years&lt;/strong&gt; and don&amp;#39;t make saving for retirement a priority.  They don&amp;#39;t save that $54.00/month.  They spend it on Starbucks and beer and cigarettes and cell phones and cable TV.  They spend too much on cars, clothes and housing when a less expensive alternative would let them save that $54.00.  They go gambling or take a vacation or rent a Jet Ski for a day.  They do a lot, but they don&amp;#39;t save that $54 every month.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s fine.  I&amp;#39;m not judging those folks.  If they want beer or cigarettes, if they want nicer clothes, if the Jet Ski was a blast - that&amp;#39;s fine!  They should enjoy their lives and enjoy the fruits of their labor the way they see fit.  But it is those choices that mean they &lt;em&gt;can&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; retire when they are 62 - not the low wages paid by their employer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I made my calculations above simplistic for the sake of demonstration.  Obviously, there are holes in it (inflation, lower earnings at younger ages make it hard to invest, etc.), but please don&amp;#39;t let those detract from the point that I&amp;#39;m making - which is that if people just saved for retirment, they&amp;#39;d be able to retire at 62.  On the other side of the simplicity, I also didn&amp;#39;t even consider social security income, inflation in wages and that most people who work consistently for 44 years are going to average much more than $10.00/hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, all the productivity of a country comes from the productive activities of the people that work for a living. Any income that retired people have can only, ultimately, come from the people that are still working.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How many workers do you need to support 1 retiree? Well, let&amp;#39;s say that every worker pitches in 10% of their income, and that retirees can live on half of what a worker can live on due to owning a home, having fewer expenses, etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That would mean that you need 5 workers for every retiree, or the system simply can&amp;#39;t support itself. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The consequence of that, though, is that the life expectancy of someone at retirement can&amp;#39;t possibly go much higher than 1/5 of one&amp;#39;s working life. If you start work after college, and work until you&amp;#39;re 62, that&amp;#39;s 41 years. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This means that your scheme can only possibly work, mathematically if people&amp;#39;s life expectancy at age 62 is no more than 70.2 years, unless the working people are paying significantly more. If we take 20% of everyone&amp;#39;s earnings, we could deal with life expectancy being 78.3 (which is about where it is today).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Is it worth that? Well, perhaps, but you&amp;#39;re not going to get the free money fairies to pay for it. Social security taxes would have to increase at least 50% above what they are at today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
I believe that abortion is only morally permissible if the mother's life is in immediate danger. I believe that it should be criminal in any other circumstance. CMV,"As I was writing the title of this post, I realized that the other circumstance under which it might be morally permissible is in a procedure referred to as ""reduction,"" where, in a case of multiple pregnancy (think octomom), one or more of the fetuses are killed in order to prevent the deaths of all the others through miscarriage. In any case, the principle remains that the only permissible reason to take a life is to save one or more lives. I do not support exceptions in cases of rape or incest; I simply don't see how killing the offspring makes the situation more palatable.  I welcome any comments regarding the point at which life begins, although I warn you, I know biology.  EDIT: I would like to point out that, although the votes are not yet visible, I can tell from my profile page that I have received a huge number of downvotes from r/changemyview in the last few hours. Downvoting because you disagree with an argument is really not in keeping with the spirit of this subreddit. If you disagree, tell me why my argument is flawed. I have not been insulting, demeaning, silly, illogical, low-effort, or anything truly deserving of a downvote. I have given as cogent a defense of my position as I am capable, and where people have pointed out potential logical flaws, I have been happy to engage constructively. I have only downvoted posts that were truly inane, which I am glad to see were relatively few. Again, please don't downvote me just because you disagree with my possibly incorrect--but sure as hell not poorly considered--position.   ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since abortion is directly and intentionally killing a pre born child I believe that it would only be morally permissible if there truly was no other alternative to saving the life of the mother. There are other medical procedures that can save the life of the mother. In my opinion, the only morally permissible thing to do is to try to save all human lives involved. For example, if a fetus dies or is injured because a mother needs to undergo some form of cancer therapy or a fetus dies because a mother needs to remove her fallopian tube as a result of an ectopic pregnancy (both attempts at saving her life) that is not the same as a fetus dying from an abortion which is a direct and intentional killing. Only the former is morally permissible. The latter is murder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem has nothing to do with biology. (Well, it does, but not in this specific argument.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I personally have no moral qualms with abortion, I&amp;#39;d like to address the premise of this logic as opposed to the argument.  I believe that being pro-life is a morally valid position to have, IF and only if the argument is consistent. I don&amp;#39;t believe your argument is consistent here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You believe that abortion is morally wrong under regular circumstances, and equate it to murder - &amp;quot;take a life.&amp;quot; However, you do say that you believe the only permissible reason to do so would be to save one or more lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the situation were that the baby would not have survived the pregnancy anyway and also would harm the mother&amp;#39;s life, then I would argue that it is not murder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, if the situation were that the baby would survive, but kill the mother in the process, then your argument doesn&amp;#39;t make sense to me. If only one life is being saved (the mother&amp;#39;s) and you consider the fetus to have a life, what makes the fetus&amp;#39; life worth less than that of the mother&amp;#39;s? And who is the mother to decide? (Just because she is the only one who can decide, does that make her morally sound in whatever choice she makes?)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I suppose you could equate it to self defense: (&amp;quot;This one individual was threatening my life, and therefore it was within moral correctness for me to kill them, as it was the only way to stop the threat.&amp;quot;) However, this logic seems flawed to me as well, because a fetus cannot have a malicious intent to harm you. Perhaps a more apt representation was would be: &amp;quot;This individual&amp;#39;s existence threatens mine, and therefore it was within moral correctness for me to kill them, as it was the only way to stop the threat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this view however, you must consider that it must be unfair then, for a one individual to decide who of the two will be able to continue living.  Obviously, if anyone were to choose between their life and another individual&amp;#39;s, they would choose their own. However, this doesn&amp;#39;t make it morally permissible for them to do so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Politicians should not be allowed to campaign through cold calls,"I will explain in anecdotal format how I came to this conclusion: I was in my company's office and was called by a restricted phone number and answered accordingly due to the fact that it could have been important.  I answered and before I could say anything but hello, I was answered and led to believe I was speaking with a person (I can usually tell if its automated).  Next, a famous politician began to inject buzzwords into my brain which were not of my own beliefs, so I naturally saw right through them. So far, none of this seems illegal (im not well-versed in law though).  I know it may be annoying yet legal, but the implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic *propaganda* to the masses through an otherwise *intimate* means of communication seems to be something that we as a people shouldn't have to stand for.   I could write more of my opinion but I really want to be wrong.  Thanks. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Propaganda is advertising, just advertising for questions of power and public policy. Even when all media was controlled by individual governments and the only thing you got from news was buzzwords it didn&amp;#39;t actually achieve lasting results or override someone&amp;#39;s personal beliefs. In fact, a lack of propaganda can be a problem because it makes it hard or even impossible to get millions of people to agree on what policy is a good idea. After all, all public policy helps some people and hurts others, the ability to judge whether it helps more than it hurts often comes down to definitions and assumptions that are not universal. Propaganda can be used to &amp;quot;normalize&amp;quot; these things to something that is unique to each person to something that groups buy into common ones that are reasonably close to what they would default to absent outside influence. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cold calling may be annoying and largely ineffective, but I don&amp;#39;t see why it should be illegal just because politicians use buzz words or are trying to gather support for points of view that you oppose. That&amp;#39;s the secret of propaganda, when we agree with the basic tenants we don&amp;#39;t see it as intrusive, we see it as someone speaking the truth in simple, clear terms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know it may be annoying yet legal, but the implications of being able to directly spread dogmatic propaganda to the masses through an otherwise intimate means of communication seems to be something that we as a people shouldn&amp;#39;t have to stand for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would argue that law is not necessarily the only or even best recourse. We don&amp;#39;t make it illegal to be ugly, for example, yet most people will spend a great deal of money trying to make themselves more physically pleasing. Running directly to the law is, with respect, a lack of imagination.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are ways you can punish this behavior. For example, recording these calls and making fun of them in the media. Comedians have a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of fun with bad political commercials - you can do something similar to ridicule the behavior and make it less popular.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In fact, government will have a hard time arguing against the 1st amendment rights of the politician (or his shills). The government needs to show that it has an interest in doing so (ok, fine, let&amp;#39;s agree it&amp;#39;s annoying and should stop), but that this is the least intrusive way to accomplish its goal (that is &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; not the case).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you let the government make something illegal simply because it has an interest in doing so and don&amp;#39;t force it to demonstrate that it&amp;#39;s the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way it can accomplish its goals, you&amp;#39;ve just screwed over the entire legal system. All the government has to say is: &amp;quot;We think the world would be better off if this were illegal. Doesn&amp;#39;t matter if the new law is intrusive.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: Ted Cruz is not a serious candidate, he's just being used by republicans to make the actual candidate seem less extreme","Ted Cruz seems to take such extreme and often ignorant stances on big public issues that, while his small following is fiercely loyal, there's no way the Republican Party thinks he actually has a chance of representing them in the battle for the presidency.  Instead, in a savvy marketing move, they convinced him to declare first so that their favored candidate will be much more appealing to the masses.  They might lose the favor of some voters on the far right in this process, but those voters are still going to vote with the party rather than turn democrat AND a comparably more liberal Republican candidate could grab enough of the swing voters to win the race.  Also, by doing this and turning voter/media attention towards things like global warming, where it is obvious the government is going to have to officially acknowledge science at some point, they are able to divert attention away from more actively-fought-over issues like campaign funding reform, banking reform and net neutrality.  This is very analogous to the way I remember the PS4 vs XBoxOne launches, where (perhaps unintentionally), in the weeks leading up to the launch, some of the most public arguments focused around XBox's inferior DRM policies and didn't talk as much about tech specs, where PS4 had them beat.  Neither side cared too much about the hardcore gamers because they were loyal to their brand and/or did all the research to make their decision, but the ""swing gamers"" would be more easily swayed by marketing.  Then, right before launch, Microsoft said ""oh, because of your feedback, we're going to drastically improve our DRM policies"" which basically took PS4's most public argument off the table.  On a side note, this really scares me because it seems like an effective tactic and I haven't read about it in any articles/blogs yet (granted I haven't read a lot about this in general, but still).","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the party can&amp;#39;t really control him or his decision to run. He has been a major pain in the ass for the party for a good while, and definitely harmed people&amp;#39;s opinion of the party much more than any slight gain they would get comparing him to a more moderate candidate. Most of the backlash against the Republican party is against extremely conservative and/or ignorant people like Cruz. I would argue that if you, as a party, could control fringe elements like Cruz and keep them from getting the spotlight, the Republican party would have significantly more appeal to moderate and independent voters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ted Cruz seems to take such extreme and often ignorant stances on big public issues that, while his small following is fiercely loyal, there&amp;#39;s no way the Republican Party thinks he actually has a chance of representing them in the battle for the presidency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Except by running he is already &amp;quot;representing them in the battle for the presidency.&amp;quot; So this, if true, would be a pretty big gamble.

Breaking the law may be profitable if a company can get away with it for a year, but what are the chances of getting caught in the first year, or even first month?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And let&amp;#39;s not forget that the costs aren&amp;#39;t always simply paying a fine, it may include restitution, punitive damages, criminal charges, loss of enrichment, and loss of public goodwill. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s make up an example.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you run a company that makes rims for cars.  You sell both to the after market and directly to the manufacturers.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One day you come up with a scheme to import cheap aluminium from North Korea.  You do the math, and by importing from North Korea, you will save $5 million a year.  You also look into the fine, and it&amp;#39;s only $500,000.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#39;s say you make it one full year before you are caught.  Right away the government slaps you with the fine.  Then when word gets out, all of the manufacturers drop you, and take you to court for the unjust enrichment of selling them North Korean aluminium and on top of that, the after market shops don&amp;#39;t want to deal with you, unless you drop your prices significantly.  And there still could be criminal charges for doing business with an enemy of America. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On top of this, the share price drops, because many people don&amp;#39;t want to hold stock in a company that deals with North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So not only have you fucked over the share holders, you have also put yourself at risk of losing your freedom.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This was a very simple example.  There are many other cases where breaking the law can have some much more serious drawbacks, like manslaughter charges, loss of the ability to do business, major environmental clean ups,  or even violence against the company.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The laws should be written in a way, and enforcement should be adequate, that breaking the law is clearly not in the best interest of the share holders, and would not be the fiduciary duty of the executives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"I think religious people are incapable of logical thought, CMV","I am a climatologist and since I started my job at USDA about a year ago, I've run into two types of people who make my life a living hell:  * There are government employees from federal and state agencies who deny climate change because ""man doesn't have that much control over god's creations"".   * Even worse, there are some who say they simply don't care what happens on earth because it's only ""the first step"" of their eternal lives. They plan on being dead and in heaven, and whatever happens here on Earth is inconsequential.   When I run into kinds of colleagues, I try to explain to them the science of what's happening. However, their responses ultimately lead them to some sort of anomalous thought patterns where their logic clearly breaks down, and science doesn't matter.  **I believe religious people at some point in their thought processes are not capable of logic, or choose to believe things their scientific minds tell them is clearly false.**  **CMV.**","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on your story, I think your claim is a bit strong.  First, you need to qualify it with &amp;quot;The religious people I work with ...&amp;quot;  Second, do you honestly think they are &lt;em&gt;incapable&lt;/em&gt; of logical thought?  Surely its possible that they just haven&amp;#39;t learned about basic logic and various logical fallacies.  These things can be learned.  So instead of saying &amp;quot;incapable of&amp;quot; you should probably change that to &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t understand.&amp;quot;  And even then, surely your religious co-workers have at least an intuitive understanding that &amp;quot;A is B&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;A is not B&amp;quot; are mutually exclusive.  And they surely have an intuitive understanding of basic logic like &lt;em&gt;modus ponens.&lt;/em&gt;  They may not always apply it correctly in daily life, but most people are at least capable of understanding these concepts.  But they probably don&amp;#39;t understand advanced logic concepts like modal logic (most people don&amp;#39;t).  So at the most you can say the don&amp;#39;t understand &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; logical thought. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Based on that, I think the strongest claim you can make is the following:  &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;The religious people I work with don&amp;#39;t understand and apply to their life some logical concepts.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are using logic, but they take other things as axiomatic. &amp;quot;A fish doesn&amp;#39;t understand the concept of water&amp;quot; might be analogous.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;300 years ago it was taken for granted that witches cause disease, so when a couple of villagers came down with the same symptoms everyone took it for granted that they have to find the witch and burn her to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From their point of view, it was as logical as someone today concluding that they have a dead battery if their car won&amp;#39;t turn over. Ah crap, time to find someone who can give me a jump.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When people accept religious concepts as deep and immutable facts it&amp;#39;s just like growing up and taking oxygen for granted. Of course God exists, he made the Earth and everything on it, and he said he wasn&amp;#39;t going to fuck around with the climate after the Great Flood. 2 + 2 = 4. It&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; logical to them. It&amp;#39;s the &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave""&gt;allegory of the cave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whereas modern science fills libraries, and it&amp;#39;s not everyone&amp;#39;s priority to read it all, even if they could.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The concept that I think matters is &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_fluency""&gt;processing fluency&lt;/a&gt;: how easy it is to &amp;quot;think&amp;quot; in a particular model. If you understand Calculus thoroughly it can be easier to &amp;quot;think in calculus&amp;quot;. Or think in statistics, or think in orbital mechanics (you have to slow down to get to your destination faster--woah, that&amp;#39;s not intuitive!)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or take the video game &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; and one of it&amp;#39;s catchprhases, &amp;quot;now you&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; in portals.&amp;quot; Once you &lt;em&gt;get it&lt;/em&gt; you take off like a rocket, but until then you flail around because your brain just hasn&amp;#39;t reconfigured itself yet. You aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;thinking in physics&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;thinking in thermodynamics&amp;quot; yet and can&amp;#39;t see how climate change can work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not unreasonable, however, to resist an idea just because you can&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;think in fluid dynamics&amp;quot; or something else that&amp;#39;s relevant. How do they know it matters? How can they know what it&amp;#39;s like if they don&amp;#39;t think in that paradigm, yet? There are lots of ways to think about the world, and we all have a natural tendency to resist new models for good reason: they&amp;#39;re wrong more often than they&amp;#39;re right.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Could I think in the models that make some horrible social injustice seem right? I probably could. For shits and giggles I could imagine what it&amp;#39;s like to think in a model where homosexuality is unnatural and harmful and understand why someone would be opposed to marriage equality. I can also think in a different model, where gay marriage is harmless. But if you&amp;#39;re not already well versed in both, it can be as hard to &amp;quot;think in arbitrary sexuality&amp;quot; as it is to think in the unintuitive world of orbital mechanics, where going faster means you go slower.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Religious people think they are thinking logically, and the way to change them is to educate them gently, and without any hostility. We must find ways to let them explore physical models that aren&amp;#39;t obvious, just like giving a child toys to play with in the bathtub so they begin to get a grip on basic fluid mechanics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Women who are anti-feminism do not have internalized misogyny.,"First let me clarify that anti-feminism isn't necessarily anti-women's rights, but against the belief in the patriarchy and institutional misogyny. Feminists often try to silence women's criticisms of feminism by saying they have internalized misogyny. I don't believe this is the case. A lack of belief in the patriarchy can be caused by the lack of empirical evidence. Examples of misogyny and discrimination don't have to be ignored or excused (as one with internalized misogyny would be expected to do) because they do not necessarily prove the existence of a patriarchy, nor institutional misogyny. Saying a woman has internalized misogyny discredits her experience of what may be a lack of being victimized. Telling a woman she's a victim when she's not is belittling. This is what draws many women away from feminism.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that a big part of your view is that a person can fight for women&amp;#39;s rights without believing we live in a patriarchy.  I would actually agree with this to a point, people can do all sorts of good things for the wrong reasons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However in order to truly affect change, a person would need to get at the underlying root of the problem right?  Fighting symptoms without the end goal of fighting the root does actually help in the end.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you agree with that, then you would agree that someone who believes society is a patriarchy would feel that someone who doesn&amp;#39;t can&amp;#39;t truly fight for women&amp;#39;s rights, because no matter how many symptoms they accurately identify and fight, they will never address the underlying problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot be anti-feminism without being misogynistic  because feminism is too broad a concept and anti-feminism implies are not a feminist yourself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You could say you are against it certain movements, or even against all movements that call themselves feminist that you have come across so far in your life. You can reject certain concepts that are often part of feminist belief systems like the patriarchy. It doesn’t matter. As can be seen in this thread, pretty everyone can be called a feminist. To take one of the more common examples: If you are for equality of women, you are a feminist, even if you call yourself an egalitarian, a humanitarin, a men’s rights activist, a christian or whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, in order to be anti-feminism you need to want to have females be below males in some capacity. This is misogyny.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Following this, any woman who is anti-feminism has internalized misogyny.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: There is no need to worry about the surveillance state.,"This was initially my comment in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/29rl7b/today_i_learned_my_ip_address_is_being_tracked_by/) thread concerning [this](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805) article.  http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805  * **TL;DR - Be a little patient, the world's not gonna end, people will INEVITABLY stand up to this practice of destroying our privacy and invading our lives. It's only a matter of time. Sorry for the text wall.**   Well, let me add a caveat to my original statement. What I was trying to say was that it would be a much bigger deal if they were using this on a large scale to effectively entrap an average citizen.  &gt; ""You'd be told only, ‘Be at a certain truck stop at a certain time and look for a certain vehicle.' And so we'd alert the state police to find an excuse to stop that vehicle, and then have a drug dog search it,"" the agent said.  Just from the information in this article, it appears that they are using this for pretty serious crimes like very large smuggling operations of guns and drugs. And, while I personally still don't find this to be entirely kosher, its also not a surprise. If they were, for example, using this to profile an average person like you or me and then trying to entice us to commit crimes that we wouldn't normally commit I would have a much bigger problem with it. That would be entrapment. But, here, we're talking about people who are KNOWN to be committing serious and sometimes violent crimes on a regular basis and they're using the information to help catch them in the act.  &gt; ""That's outrageous,"" said Tampa attorney James Felman, a vice chairman of the criminal justice section of the American Bar Association. ""It strikes me as indefensible.""  I tend to agree with this sentiment and I am fully aware that this is the start of a very slippery slope which could EASILY turn towards using it against people who haven't actually committed a crime yet (in a sort of Minority Report, pre-cognitive way). And, even more conspiratorial, I can imagine this becoming a tool in societal engineering in the sense that it could be used to stop political movements before they start. But, I am not convinced that this is actually happening... YET.  So, back to the original post concerning why people don't already massively protest this... it's because this is a very grey area that many people wouldn't have a problem with even if they knew for a fact that it was happening. As I said in another comment, this system still requires them to find traditionally admissible evidence with a warrant, they still have to do the grunt work after this guides them to the honey jar.  I see some possible futures when it comes to the whole topic of secret surveillance in general.  1. they get greedy, use this on lesser and lesser crimes and it eventually becomes so widely known that people become scared that its not 'just' drug dealers and gun runners anymore. This sparks more widespread outcries and activism and the public finally denounces it forcing it's power to be restricted or revoked.  2. Law enforcement attempts to make this sort of evidence admissible in court publicly, a national debate ensues, and again the power of warrantless information is legally neutered due to public pressure.  Either of these paths could end in two ways, peacefully or violently (as in not-so peaceful protests) BUT, I simply do not believe that the citizens of the United States or any other country will somehow continue to allow this to progress out of complacency or some crap like that. Take the civil rights movement, for example. The things that instigated the massive protests to end racial segregation were not small events, they were events that affected thousands of black people. People could SEE everyday that there were two bathrooms for blacks and whites, that they weren't allowed to get an education, that they were physically beaten and killed by police and even civilians, and that they were loudly and unsympathetically abused verbally all occurring over the course of years and years. It wasn't like one day everyone just said, 'ok enough, today we're gonna end racism'... it was a slow buildup of events and the voicing of opinions by MLK and hundreds of other social leaders that created an eloquent, logical, AND emotional foundation which opposed the discrimination that was occurring. They provided the guidance of why it was wrong, why the general public was REQUIRED to force a change, and gave them the belief that they COULD change it.   Now, look at the surveillance issue. There has really only been one major event that was on par with something like a mass hanging or seeing someone beat to death and dragged behind a truck and that was the revelation of all the documents from Wikileaks/Snowden. That was the point at which the public at large became initially AWARE at all that this was even occurring while, previously, it would have sounded like every other conspiracy theory. At that point we had ground to stand on because we had hard evidence of this illegal and morally objectionable practice. Sure, it's been going on for a long time and many people have KNOWN that... but there was really no evidence to back it up previously. No one had been illegally detained (referring to Manning), no one had been forced to flee the country for being a whistle-blower (Julian Assange/Ed Snowden). Now, these things have been harped on by media outlets for YEARS. People have been forced now to put thought into it and we are starting to build a community of LEADERS who serve to maintain awareness and build confidence that something can be done about it.  I know that this is long winded but I think it's important to contextualize what is going on by comparing it to previous issues that are somewhat similar.   &gt; By late 1962, frustration at the slow pace of political change [in the civil rights movement] was balanced by the movement's strong support for legislative initiatives: housing rights, administrative representation across all US Government departments, safe conditions at the ballot box, pressure on the courts to prosecute racist criminals... Assassination cut short the life and careers of both the Kennedy brothers and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The essential groundwork of the Civil Rights Act 1964 had been initiated before John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The dire need for political and administrative reform was driven home on Capitol Hill by the combined efforts of the Kennedy brothers, Dr. King (and other leaders,) and President Lyndon Johnson.  Three MAJOR societal leaders who were respected and outspoken were ASSASSINATED and this was after about 15 years of the unrest building and building. Unfortunately, this is what will most likely have to happen (or something on this scale) before real change occurs. I would love if massive political upheaval were quicker and easier to effect, but... its just not how it works.  It WILL happen eventually and many terrible things will likely be perpetrated when it comes to the surveillance state but we are really at the whim of inciting incidents to help motivate the citizenry. Without something to point at and a powerful, relatable leader like JFK or MLK to push the issue into the collective consciousness of the people, we will not see the major changes we are hoping for.  Assange, Snowden and Manning started this thing but they, with all due respect, are not in a position to do what needs to be done beyond what they've already accomplished. They can't tour the country giving powerful speeches, they are not generally viewed as charismatic people, and they aren't even in the country anyway. **Occupy wall street failed because they didn't have strong leaders going for them.** JFK was the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, MLK was a reverend and a speaker on par with the very best. Both revered members of society in the eyes of the general public. I can't think of a single person who fits that bill in the present day. Obama is clearly not that person, in fact, no politicians at all could hope to fill those shoes. I don't know who COULD live up to that challenge but it will happen. Something reprehensible will inevitably occur perpetrated by the NSA/Law Enforcement and it will be the tipping point, leaders will emerge naturally and organically. More and more ordinary people will start to be NOTICEABLY affected by this surveillance and the wave will break as it always has and always will. I am not worried at all that this apocalyptic, Orwellian nightmare will ever even come to pass. If it does, it will be quite short lived and met with the wrath of millions of people who simply won't accept it.  If you read all that then I TRULY appreciate it, I am very passionate about this topic and I only want to serve to provide a bit of confidence to people who are afraid that this will simply become the norm and we'll all just have to grin and bear it. I strongly believe that that will not be the case.  **EDIT: I'll say that my view has been sufficiently changed to hand out some deltas. For one, I can now see a few intrinsic, immediate downsides that can arise simply from the fact that you are being surveilled. I agree with the idea that just knowing that it is happening can change your behavior and instill fear even if the data isn't directly used. Although, I still feel that the data itself is not exactly necessary for the government to oppress its people if they wanted to do so, rather the act of collecting it is, firstly a huge red flag that absolutely SHOULD cause mass protests, and secondly, serves to erode our rights in a subtle way that paves the path for further infringement and, by doing it slowly and maintaining the guise of protection through surveillance they are softening the collective feelings of our society towards similar legislation.**  Thanks to those of you who commented _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

None of us can see into the future. And even if it did, wouldn&amp;#39;t that be a worrying prospect itself? It wasn&amp;#39;t at all an easy battle, being built on years of needless suffering by a large segment of the populace and involving the assassination of key leaders in the movement. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure everyone involved in the civil rights movement was worried about its outcome. If your argument is that in the case of the surveillance state a similar movement is inevitable, then we should be worried.

"Indoor live music gigs are far too loud, and should be quieter. CMV.","Why do sound technicians ruin so many indoor gigs by turning the whole volume up (especially the bass) so loud that the entire thing becomes distorted and mushy? I love loud music as much as the next person, but the volume level of music at gigs is absurd. I saw Less Than Jake at a very small venue (with a capacity of about 500 people at most) and the sound levels were absurdly high - the whole thing became a disorienting blur of sound. Recently I brought ear plugs when I went to see The Bronx, and the experience was incredible - I could actually hear the songs in a clarity that was comfortable and enjoyable.  It seems to me that seasoned gig goers and sound-techs alike simply don't mind how loud live music is because their ear-drums have been significantly dulled from years of going to loud gigs (effectively removing the need for ear plugs). For those of us with hearing mostly intact, I think gigs are absurdly loud, and sound-techs could reduce the volume by up to 50% in many cases for a much more pleasurable listening experience - still loud, but not so loud that the vocals and rhythm all fuse into what can be, effectively, white noise. In any case the bass needs to come down. When the bass is so loud that you feel your clothes rippling: something is wrong. And yes, I blame the sound-techs and not the band. Being in a band myself, I know that it's very hard to tell what you sound like from the audience when on-stage, even with monitors.   So I think that gigs should be quieter. This would not only be more enjoyable, but spare many people the hearing loss later in life that live music can cause. I don't think it should be acceptable to have a gig so loud that you hear a ringing in your ears the next day. Change my view.  --------------  P.S. - I go to gigs in London. Maybe this isn't such an issue elsewhere in the world.  P.P.S. - As you may have noticed in the title, I'm only referring to indoor gigs. Outdoor gigs still tend to have sound issues of their own, but their volume is generally at a much more comfortable level due to the sound having room to disperse rather than bouncing off walls in an indoor environment.  P.P.P.S. - I'm referring specifically to 'guitar oriented' live music. The issues in quality of sound are rarely - in my experience - present during a classical orchestra concert, or a jazz/swing band gig.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I may not want to change your view about the volume problem, but I do want to change your opinion regarding who is at fault.  Full disclosure, I have been working professionally as a sound engineer for 15 years. I&amp;#39;m not saying that the sound engineer is not also a part of the problem. The fault lies with many parties.  As a sound engineer, I fight band stage volume on every band I work with. Many times I have a producer (who writes my paycheck) telling me to turn it up. The guitarist whose amp is turned up to eleven.   The band manager who wants the whole thing turned up.  The drummer. (Enough said.) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And yes, many sound techs just turn it up because the sound system can get that loud, not realizing that there is a difference between can and should.  I do the best I can to never mix bands anymore because it&amp;#39;s not fun, it&amp;#39;s just loud.  Plus, I think it may be worse in the US here as there are no local regulations that I know of for volume limits as there can be in the UK. I hope you can see though that there are many factors involved in creating that sound, and that when a show is too loud, a lot of people can be to blame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually agree with you largely. However, a lot of the problem lies on the band itself. As a guitarist, I never would have believed it. But I absolutely did once I shifted into live sound.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) Drums are fucking loud. Ever hear a drummer tear into a snare? Ever hear one smash his cymbals? In some small club shows, there&amp;#39;s almost no need for a mic (except for the thump of a kick, and a little added sound just so nothing gets lost). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) Often, especially with rock bands, the guitarists feel the need to have guitar amps WAY overpowered for the space they&amp;#39;re playing in. Nobody actually &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; a 100 watt, 8x12 guitar amp and cabinets. 30 watts and a 10&amp;quot; speaker are more than enough once you have a mic on it. But so many bands crank up their amps to the point where what you&amp;#39;re hearing in the audience doesn&amp;#39;t have anything to do with the sound guy and everything to do with &amp;quot;but I NEED to have my amp turned up!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) Way too much bass is a bad thing, yes, but at the same time please remember, your hearing probably isn&amp;#39;t going to be damaged from bass that&amp;#39;s too loud. It takes a hell of a lot more low-frequency power to do any remote sort of damage to your hearing than you will ever notice in a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4) PRO sound guys (not just the tech at your local night club) aren&amp;#39;t dulled from years of loud gigs. We actually carry custom-moulded earplugs designed to reduce SPL without changing the sounds we&amp;#39;re hearing (too much). What you have to understand there is that MOST concert-goers only see an occasional show. The loud volumes won&amp;#39;t do much damage if it only happens once or twice a year. Touring engineers are exposed to it every single day, often over 100 nights a year, plus soundcheck, rehearsals... I&amp;#39;d absolutely recommend earplugs for any frequent concert goer. But it&amp;#39;s not going to affect 75%+ (depending on genre) of the audience to see one show that&amp;#39;s a bit too loud. That is, assuming this last factor is not in play...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;5) A lot of times, it&amp;#39;s a crapshoot as to what a venue has when it comes to sound. I tour with a national act, and I call venues before every single show, often two or three times, to make sure what they have will be good enough. Half the time, what I walk into is nothing like what they said on the phone. Or they have the whole rig set up wrong so it&amp;#39;s not actually working at its full potential, or it&amp;#39;s far too powerful for its own good. The problem gets even worse if the band doesn&amp;#39;t have their own engineer; then it&amp;#39;s entirely up to a house tech who is usually inexperienced or has already blown their ears out, or both. A band that carries its own sound system is going to be much better, but they&amp;#39;re also going to only play larger venues like arenas, and they&amp;#39;ll have time to fine-tune the system to work perfectly for the room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: It IS hard being a baby.,"When a newborn is crying someone will occasionally say in a babyish or condescending tone ""Oh, it's so hard."" or ""Oh, you have such a rough life"" or something to that effect.  I posit that it actually *is* a rough life. Sure, you don't do anything and you have your needs catered to, but this is because we're seeing it from an adult's perspective. From the newborn's perspective, you don't know when your next meal is coming, and you don't know if you're going to have to sit in your own filth forever. You don't even know who your parents are. You don't have language, and you can only communicate via screaming. Hell, if you're being breastfed, you (and your mother) don't know how to feed you the best way right off the bat. When your diaper is changed, you don't know what's going on except that you're suddenly very cold and are having a cold, wet cloth wiping your nether regions.  I don't know about you, but I can't really blame newborns for screaming a lot of the time, even if it is annoying to adults.  Edit: An important point is that it's not just that people cater to your needs, it's that you *can't* address them in the slightest. That sounds more prison-like than paradise, to me.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

They don&amp;#39;t even know a language yet so they can not think, &amp;quot;When will someone feed me?&amp;quot; These things may upset the child in the moment, but I can not see these small problems contributing to a difficult life where the child does not look forward to the following days hardships. And that is really my main point: &lt;strong&gt;A baby does not have a rough life because the baby has absolutely no understanding of life. The baby can not develop a perspective. It can only be upset in that moment or happy in that moment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I assume we are talking about young infants: what I am about to say is quite untrue for toddlers. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The worst part about pain is the anxiety that comes along with it. Chronic pain causes depression not because of the physical sensation alone - a large part of it is the anxiety that accompanies the realization of all the future pain you will experience. Would you rather be told today that you will die in a horrifying, gruesome accident (but not be told when) or would you rather just have it happen at some point without knowing of it? Most people would pick the latter because of the mental anguish caused by being aware of the future. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Babies do not have this. Infants cannot imagine the future and what it will be like - they experience only the present. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course babies experience pain. But all animals do. So in that way, babies do not have it any worse. The anxiety you are describing from feeling helpless simply is not there - it&amp;#39;s only awareness of the present. If YOU were turned into a baby, it would be horrible for you to experience. You would not be able to be as free of anxiety as a baby is. But they are able to live without those chains. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Living in the present - free of the burdens of the future and of the past - sounds to me what yogis and spiritual advisors of Eastern religions see as the unattainable ideal of human existence. We would all be happier if we could experience each pain and joy in the present, with no expectation of what&amp;#39;s to come. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is the ideal way of living, and for a brief moment in our lives, we are able to. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I've never seen Communism as a bad thing. CMV,"Sure, the USSR was butting heads with the US and Vietnam was a thing, but the I don't see the concept of communism as anti-American, anti-democracy, etc. I don't see the fact that China has a communist foundation as a particular threat to the ""American way."" Honestly, I think communism can work when it is used in small pockets, much like [kibbutzim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz) in Israel or the few communes we have here in the US. CMV","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communism can only work on a small level, and that&amp;#39;s the problem with it as an overarching political philosophy.  It will never work on a large scale in America.  One of the reasons I like the Voluntayrist idea is that if you and 5000 others want to set up a Communist society, you can do so.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think the main issue I have with Communism(I used to actually support it), is the theory behind it never plays out in actuality.  Look at North Korea.  That has &amp;quot;Communist&amp;quot; roots, yet it&amp;#39;s ruled as an totalitarian regime.  TIL had a great post about North Korea, that had a good video link to a Nat Geo video on it.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If there was any history of someone making it work in the real world, I think it&amp;#39;d gain more traction.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for the American Way issue, it&amp;#39;s somewhat counter-intuitive to how America was founded(on the individual&amp;#39;s rights and liberties).  It essentially requires you give up some of these rights and liberties, to make for a more perfect society.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This in my opinion, is why it will never take root in America, without a violent revolution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to change half your view. That is, communism as it has been practised in the world is pretty bad, and its an ideology that&amp;#39;s contrary to most endemic American values.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with that. I currently live in a post-communist state, and no one here really regrets the revolution, except those who were power-holders. And a lot of them are still power-holders. Communism as practised in USSR, China, Eastern Europe, and certainly NK, is a totalitarian regime that crushes individual liberties, develops generally poor economic outcomes, and involves mass systemic violence against the population. Really, read some history and you&amp;#39;ll see that 20th century communism has been a terrible failure.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;America, in its political-ideological history has valued individual liberty, the right to resist tyranny by government, generally a minimalist/libertarian view of the governments role, free-market trade, etc etc.. It is a set of values diametrically opposed to many of the values of communist states.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, America has a political history from the cold war of demonising the other - anything to paint communism as &amp;#39;anti-american&amp;#39;, which is a way to polarise your community and align political opponents &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; america with hostile foreign powers. In this sense, the portrayal of Communism in America as anti-American was, in my view, a fairly nasty polemical rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: Hiphop culture was born at the cross roads of racism, poverty, and the American Dream, and deserves more credit","I've been thinking about this for a while. There are serious parallels between the Great Gatsby, and Hip-Hop culture. Both portray their main characters as being born from poverty, and progressing to riches only through disregard of their morals, chasing money. Illmatic, a hiphop classic, is full of references to this part of hiphop culture. ""Is like a maze full of black rats trapped"" says Nas, in the famous NY state of mind. The next track, ""Life's a bitch"" goes further into this mentality -""Visualising the realism of life in actuality fuck who's the baddest a persons status depends on salary"". Another classic hiphop song C.R.E.A.M. resigns to this fact as Gatsby does - ""Cash rules everything around me.""  The racism aspect is also clear - ""Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon, and at the airport they check all through my bags and tell me it's random **but we stay winning** "" This is also where the stereotypical hate for the police comes from. Nas, in a song about the crushing poverty where he grew up - Memory Lane - says ""No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace"". Even worse than the fellow black people trying to get out - like Gatsby, are the police, trying to keep the "" Black rats"" in the trap. ""Judges hanging niggas, incorrect bails, for direct sales, my intellect prevails, from a hanging cross, with nails.""  The mentality of being born into a racist system, trying to keep you down, combined with the constant drumming into you what the American dream is, motivates people to do terrible things. But I think that Hiphop deserves more attention, and credit, for being a modern day retelling of the flawed American Dream, and Racist System, and what happens when they meet.  ""He see it as another felony drug arrest, any day could be the day he picks the wrong thug to test, slug through the vest, shot in the street **for pulling heat on a father whose baby gotta eat**""","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re saying that Hip Hop isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;getting credit&amp;quot;, but what does that really mean to you, OP?  Because I would argue that Hip Hop has been critically applauded in many, many ways, and, you can&amp;#39;t get much more credit than archives being created to keep Hip Hop recordings and article clippings in &lt;a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/12/10/369841627/cornell-to-digitize-a-rich-hip-hop-archive""&gt;Adler Archive with its rare books and manuscripts in a secure vault 150 feet underground, at Cornell University.&lt;/a&gt;. Cornell University recognizes Hip Hop works as something worth studying, and being available to scholars and the public. Additionally, Harvard University began to take it seriously over 10 years ago, in 2002 when it started its Hip-Hop Archive and Research Institute. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Think about that, Harvard, a school synonymous with WASP&amp;#39;s and privilege, the first thing you may think of when it comes to an &amp;quot;Ivy League&amp;quot; school, values Hip Hop so much they have a Research Institute and archive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A lot of other commenters are talking about the comparison you&amp;#39;re making to the the glorification that Rock &amp;quot;legends&amp;quot; like Hendrix and The Stones have gotten. However, consider that their heyday was the 60&amp;#39;s and 70&amp;#39;s, whereas hip hop didn&amp;#39;t really hit it&amp;#39;s stride until the early 90&amp;#39;s. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d make a side point here that many early 90&amp;#39;s genres are only just now getting major criticism recognition, and that&amp;#39;s often for artists/styles that are effectively dead and gone (re: nirvana). Hip Hop, however, is still evolving, changing, and being mass produced, by artists both good and bad. Still, though, Hip Hop today is still a very valid genre, and there&amp;#39;s a huge difference between Classic Hip Hop and &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; of the mainstream ilk out there. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;strong&gt;classic&lt;/strong&gt; Hip Hop and Rap artists awarded that kind of recognition for example &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run%E2%80%93D.M.C.""&gt;Run DMC being inducted into the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame in 2009&lt;/a&gt; And, you have brought up Kayne&amp;#39;s awards and critical fame &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_on_the_cover_of_Rolling_Stone""&gt;he&amp;#39;s been featured on the Rolling Stone cover twice, and Jay-Z five times&lt;/a&gt;, which I think essentially negates your own point --- Hip Hip is getting credit, just maybe not in the way you think it deserves. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;End point, scholars and musical critics alike note the influence and vastness of hip hop, and it&amp;#39;s overall worth. That said, not every artist out there today is amazing, or worthy of drawing comparisons to classic literature, just like many other genres that put out popular music. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Critical recognition is very different from public recognition, and Hip Hop has had a tough road in that respect, with a lot of negative publicity due to past gang violence, and now celebrity antics. No one, though, is arguing the worth of Hip Hop being less than any other musical genre out there, though. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your view is WAY too vague. What does &amp;quot;deserve more credit&amp;quot; mean? What is it that you really want to see happen? For example, if hip-hop &amp;quot;got&amp;quot; the credit it deserved, then what would that look like, and how does it differ from what we see today? I&amp;#39;m not really sure what you&amp;#39;re tangibly advocating for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to assume your post is a response to those who criticize most modern hip-hop/rap for it&amp;#39;s materialism, misogyny, glorification of drugs/criminal culture, etc. To that, I would respond by acknowledging that the people who make these criticisms are not necessarily criticizing the entire genre. It&amp;#39;s more like their criticizing the mainstream rap/hip-hop, which I believe deserves the criticisms. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we can definitely criticize specific songs and/or artists who &lt;em&gt;happen&lt;/em&gt; to be rappers. I see nothing wrong with that. If your music promotes bad ideas, then you deserve to be criticized. Simply being a hip-hop artists should not shield you from otherwise justified criticism. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: The purpose of the federal government is to protect our human rights.... that's it.,"The federal government only needs to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This means that things such as murder, rape, and theft are illegal because you are infringing on someone else's rights to live, own property, and pursue their dream life. Everything else should be inherently allowed by the FEDERAL government.  Then, per the Constitution, each of the 50 states would have complete democratic freedom to decide on issues such as minimum wage, abortion, gun rights, wage equality, marriage equality, etc etc etc. Basically, everything else. People could move freely to the states that reflect their personal morals. States that adopted policies that led to economic depression or social injustice would likely change their policies because people would move out.  So why does the federal government get to control so much? Why do we GIVE them that power?  I am of course speaking of the United States as that is the only country I have lived in, feel free to give opinions/examples using other countries.  Change my view.  EDIT: Let me clarify: violations of human rights such as murder, rape, and theft should be *universally recognized as illegal by the federal government*, while everything else should be up to states. I am aware that the federal government does not take care of murder, rape, and theft cases.   EDIT 2: Thanks to down42roads I no longer believe the feds should just be involved ""in protecting human rights"" as I read article I, section 8 of the Constitution and most of the listed responsibilities have nothing to do with the states. My biggest problem is how the federal government CURRENTLY steps into states issues without regard to the constitution. I still think almost all social issues and many financial issues should be decided upon by the states themselves.   EDIT 3: I'm off to bed, but thank you for all the comments.

Thanks for participating, hopefully I can get some more in tomorrow (: ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What constitutes human rights?

I believe I chose my own sexuality. CMV,"I honestly feel like the sexuality I ended up living (roughly bisexual), was the result of a series of lifestyle choices and steps towards a goal. Clearly very few people would agree, so I'd like to know what you all think. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;#39;s a discrepancy between what you think of as sexuality and how the word is commonly used. When you&amp;#39;re saying you choose your sexuality, you&amp;#39;re referring to choosing who you are sexually active with, right? You phrase it as &amp;#39;the sexuality you ended up living&amp;#39;, so I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m misinterpreting your idea of sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When referring to sexuality, most people are referring to the sex and/or gender of the people you are interested in, not who you end up having sex with. That&amp;#39;s why most people wouldn&amp;#39;t say that all celibate individuals are of an asexual orientation. They&amp;#39;re just not having sex with anyone. Similarly, can a virgin not have an orientation?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While some celibate individuals (or virgins) may certainly be asexual, it&amp;#39;s rather likely they are still sexually attracted to certain individuals but simply are not acting on it. It is then the case that their sexual orientation and their sexual behavior do not match. Both of these are an aspect of sexuality and impact what sexuality we identify with, but when we refer to sexuality, we&amp;#39;re mainly talking about orientation and not behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So what I&amp;#39;m saying is, you&amp;#39;re not necessarily wrong and I don&amp;#39;t completely disagree. You&amp;#39;re just talking about something different from what we generally mean when we refer to sexuality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider this: do you think that if you wanted to, you could choose to stop being bisexual and only be attracted to one sex?

CMV:Denying children vaccination is a form a child abuse and should be illegal.,"Vaccination saves lives. Parents who deny their children the right to vaccinations because of their superstitions or religious beliefs are harming their children and should be held legally responsible. Failing to vaccinate either your child and even yourself is irresponsible behavior and not only are you putting your child at risk, but you are also putting others around you at risk as well. Children who can't receive vaccinations and develop immunity to the diseases rely on the community to get vaccinated. Therefore, refusing to vaccinate your child is not only a form of child abuse, but it is also putting others at risk. It's not a personal choice issue. It's civic responsibility. Everyone should be vaccinated and everyone should be required to vaccinate their children.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;While rare, vaccines do have potentially fatal risks and some children, especially those with allergies or compromised immune systems, are advised by doctors not to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we know from what the &lt;a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-05-21/the-cia-stops-fake-vaccinations-as-real-polio-rebounds""&gt;CIA did a few years ago&lt;/a&gt; in the search for Osama bin Laden that government agencies are not above using vaccinations for ulterior purposes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As long as health risks and the potential for government abuse do exist, the choice of whether to vaccinate a child should ultimately be left up to the parent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That said, the government should be able to protect society by preventing vaccinated children from attending public school or going to public parks due to the danger of infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be an extreme case of government overreach in my opinion.  Passing this law would probably have the opposite effect that it&amp;#39;s shooting for.  People would not vaccinate their kids as a form of protest and you&amp;#39;d probably end up with even more kids not being vaccinated.  You can&amp;#39;t legislate common sense.  Besides, you would have to violate their privacy to enforce such a law.  You need to think much harder before you say &amp;quot;there should be a law&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The best we can do it to deny kids entry into public schools without vaccinations for highly contagious diseases and to provide those vaccinations for free at the schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: Illegal drugs should stay illegal.,"**edit: this has turned into marijuana rather than all illegal drugs. Not all the arguments apply to say heroin (eg lots of people already using it, medical benefits). Do people arguing for marijuana being legal agree that the other 'harder' drugs should be legal too? On those same arguments?**  I think illegal drugs should stay illegal, and I haven't heard a convincing argument otherwise.  This is from the perspective of a UK citizen, but I believe the US system is broadly the same in terms of what substances are illegal, so that is equally applicable.  Some substances are illegal for a myriad of reasons, such as being detrimental to health, productivity, other people, and so on.  Although it is difficult to pick one specific criterion for what makes a specific illicit drug illegal, I think that overall illicit drugs staying illegal does much less harm to society than if they were legalised.  As to why I think it would be worse for society, please see my refuting points to the arguments I've heard thus (e.g., I think it would be worse for society for the same reason alcohol and tobacco cause problems in society).  Here are a summary of some reasons why they should be legal that I've heard, and my refuting points:  - Much worse products are available for consumption; alcohol, tobacco... *So why add another to the mix?!*  - It doesn't affect other people - alcohol does and that's legal!  I won't start fights or piss everywhere when I'm high! *When you're smoking marijuana and the smell is blowing through my windows and sticking to my clothes/bedsheets, yeah that's affecting me*  - If it's regulated that stops the product going to kids *Kids still get alcohol/tobacco/knives...*  - The money goes to 'terrorists' when it could go to the government *That is an argument not to do the drugs and fund 'the terrorists'...*  - If drugs were legal then the police would have more time to stop other illegal things, and we could save money! *Why not make all crimes legal, then the police don't need to exist and we save all the money!*  - I can't get addicted to certain drugs like I can to nicotine etc *Maybe not physically, but people certainly can have a dependence on illegal drugs that is mental*  Edit:  - If you think marijuana/ecstasy/coke should be illegal, you should support prohibition of alcohol etc too! *I think that if alcohol etc had been discovered recently then they would be banned. However, since so many people partake in it already it would be impossible (cf America tried it!).  I think tobacco one day will become illegal, as it is slowly phased out.*  - Addicts can't get help if it's illegal! *Then we give addicts who WANT to get help immunity from prosecution* _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV,"This is a very specific to peer-reviewed scientific journals and does *not* include recent initiatives like Obama’s push to increase access to public/government-funded data [^1](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/22/expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research)   The main crux of my argument is that, *if adopted universally*, the open-access model of peer-reviewed scientific research for journals would effectively shift the cost burden from the reader/consumer of scientific literature to researchers/producers and this is a net-negative for the advancement of science overall.  Assumption 1: It costs something to create, manage, and publish a scientific journal. The amount is irrelevant, lets just call it $X.  Assumption 2: There are more readers/consumers of scientific research journals than there are researchers/producers.   To illustrate my point I’ll be using the open-access journal [*PlosOne*](http://www.plosone.org) and the ‘traditional’ journal [*Nature*](http://www.nature.com). Now if I want to publish a research article in PlosOne it would cost me $1,350 [^2](http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/authors/) They do say that they have waivers available for those who cannot afford this fee, but that “most authors pay the full fee”. Conversely, a 1-year subscription to Nature for an individual is $199 [^3](http://www.nature.com/ecommerce/subscribe.action?productId=nature). Neither of these costs are negligible, especially for students, but the subscription cost is considerably less prohibitive than the publication cost, especially when you consider the fact that many institutions (both public and private) confer access to affiliates. I've been affiliated with 3 universities in the US in a research role and none of them have ever covered the cost of publishing in an open-access journal (either as a student or full-time researcher)  Now up until this point, nothing I have said supports the notion that this scheme is bad. In fact, I believe the ideal situation is to have a mix of open-access and traditional journals because they serve different purposes. However, I think this issue is obfuscated by the use of the term ‘open-access’. The reason I believe this model is bad is that it would lead to an environment in which only those with the resources to publish have the opportunity to disseminate their results. Institutions (both academic and private) would have an immense advantage in publishing research and it could narrow the possibility of contrary findings reaching wide audiences. This is obviously a situation in which the truth regarding research could be overshadowed by vested interests. Hypothetically, Pharma company Z could pay to have 50 studies published showing the efficacy of drug Y whereas the small independent group of researchers can only afford 1 study showing the opposite. This would magnify the already existing problem of [publication bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publication_bias) and could be disastrous.  This is getting long already so I’ll just add one more point regarding the advancement of science. I think there are competing interests in the world of science between advancement and dissemination. These two things are not mutually exclusive by any means but are often in conflict. It appears ‘traditional’ journals are more focused on the former whereas open-access journals are focused on the latter. While dissemination and access are both important I believe that for measured scientific progress to occur we need to encourage more data/results, not less. Universal adoption of the open-access model towards scientific research would be an obstacle to this goal.   CMV! ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the cost to a university or institution to subscribe to a journal?  If I remember correctly it&amp;#39;s often in the tens of thousands.  Now think of all the journals a university subscribes to.  If every journal became open access, it frees up a lot of cash that a university could use to cover publishing fees. EDIT: I found &lt;a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/apr/24/harvard-university-journal-publishers-prices""&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; which claims Harvard pays $3.5 million annually in subscription fees for journals.  At $1350 an article, that&amp;#39;s about 2,600 publications in PLoS One.  I&amp;#39;d argue that publication fees will drop as more journals adopt the open access model. So if all journals were open access, we&amp;#39;d expect to see more affordable publication fees.  Consequently, a university would be able to publish many more articles.  Even if a university finds itself short on funds, it can still choose to subsidize the cost of publishing for its faculty, whereas under the current subscription system, the university would be forced to choose which journal subscriptions to drop.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, with open access journals such as PLoS One, the decision to accept or reject a manuscript is made before the journal requests its publication fee.  So if someone can&amp;#39;t afford the publication fee, but the paper was accepted, PLoS will waive the fee.  So, if you&amp;#39;ve got a good study, it will still get published under the OA model regardless of whether you can pay.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I also dispute the idea that research could be overshadowed by vested interests.  When it comes to scientific research, one very high quality study can overshadow any number of lesser studies.  Journals such as PLoS One and now Science&amp;#39;s and Nature&amp;#39;s open access journals still maintain pretty high standards with regard to the quality of research they&amp;#39;ll publish.  If Pharma Z does a poor quality study, they&amp;#39;re still going to be rejected from a high tier OA journal.  They might still publish in a lesser journal, but they could&amp;#39;ve done that anyway under the current system.  Additionally, I&amp;#39;m not sure big corporations really care all that much if their studies get published.  Their main concern is getting their final product past the FDA or other regulatory agency so they can profit from its sale.  There&amp;#39;s no real point to putting 50 studies in a bunch of journals because the average person won&amp;#39;t read them, and so it doesn&amp;#39;t really affect public opinion at all.  However, if someone without institutional access to journals does want to read a study, they now no longer have to pay a fee to read it.  This helps both science and education in the long run because individuals with a passion for science and institutions in poor countries now have access to the most cutting-edge research.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally there&amp;#39;s the common argument that under the current subscription model, society is paying a large fee to read research that it already funded with tax-payer dollars in many cases.  I personally believe that if research was funded by government grants, any publication that results should be made available to the public for free.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I published in PLoS One last year, so my opinion is a bit biased. The agency that funded the research covered the publishing fee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s amusing that you bring up &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in terms of &amp;quot;advancement&amp;quot; of science. Truefact (and I speak from experience; in my twenty year scientific career, I have published three articles in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nature Physics&lt;/em&gt; and have had twice that many rejected from same, not because of quality of science, but because the work lacks sufficient &amp;quot;curb appeal&amp;quot;): if your field of study is not deemed suitably fashionable or trendy by the editors, then &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; will not touch your manuscript, no matter what the quality of work. (About 80% of the time, they don&amp;#39;t even send it out for review.) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tell me how such a model &amp;quot;advances&amp;quot; science when entire subfields are neglected for what seems arbitrary and capricious reasons. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not all open access is equivalent by any stretch. Sure, there are fly-by-night operations out of India or China that have no standards. But then journals such as &lt;em&gt;New Journal of Physics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Phys. Rev. X&lt;/em&gt; in physics (my field) have high impact factors, low publication costs for the authors, and yet maintain very high standards of scholarship irrespective of their costing model. Moreover, many (if not most) of the traditional, archival journals offer open access options for publication that have no bearing on the referee and review process. And some (including the journal of which I&amp;#39;m an Editor) waive the cost of publication from groups who cannot afford the fees. The line is nowhere near as clean as you are making it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What matters, ultimately, is maintaining an individual journal&amp;#39;s quality standards and ensuring that high levels of scholarship are maintained. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, when the scientific work is done by scientists in the public employ, funded by publicly funded grants (which are reviewed by publicly funded peers and managed by publicly funded program managers), published in journals whose editors are working &lt;em&gt;pro bono&lt;/em&gt; as part of their publicly funded job, refereed by scientific peers paid by the public, and then publication fees paid by these same grants (even most traditional journals have page changes), then it makes sense for these articles to be as widely accessible as possible to the same public, not shuttered behind a corporate paywall. This just strikes me as unethical and a disservice to the public we&amp;#39;re purportedly serving.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit: typo&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I think people on reddit are unreasonably hostile to business interests. CMV.,"To clarify, I'm pretty solidly liberal, and I favor higher taxes and increased regulation. That being said, it seems like anything pretty much any company does, besides Valve, is immediately dismissed as a shameless cash-grab. The concept of turning a profit or increasing revenue is often considered morally wrong or downright evil.  The attitude towards piracy is a good example: whenever a company attempts to protect the product that they spent time and resources on from being stolen, it's viewed as proof of their greed. I think this is completely unreasonable. A company has the right and often the need to protect their product. Even if it costs nothing for someone else to download it, the software required a significant amount of money and effort to produce and bring to market. Except in a few extreme circumstances, efforts by companies to curtail piracy are totally reasonable.  Another notion that seems common on reddit is that corporations are evil who only want money and never did anything good for anyone. I think that, while it's obvious corporations want more money, that does not mean they haven't done any good along the way. Tech companies make life easier, agribusiness helps feed an enormous and growing population, and healthcare, while grossly overpriced, provides better treatment options than at any time in history.  To summarize, I think the idea that ""turning a profit"" and companies in general are evil is unreasonable.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;To summarize, I think the idea that &amp;quot;turning a profit&amp;quot; and companies in general are evil is unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think this is what redditors actually believe though. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to start by saying I dislike CMVs in this format. It&amp;#39;s hard, sometimes borderline impossible, to reasonably demonstrate that people in group X believe thing Y. It&amp;#39;s not really a falsifiable position to hold because all evidence for and against is going to be purely anecdotal. It&amp;#39;d be better to argue for or against specific beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since you provided examples of specific beliefs, I can address those, but the underlying attitude problem is a much harder issue to deal with. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The attitude towards piracy is a good example&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Full disclosure, I am a game programmer. None of the games I&amp;#39;ve worked on have DRM of any kind (In fact they&amp;#39;re all free to play, so doing so would be dumb anyway :P)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reason people don&amp;#39;t like anti-piracy efforts is because they are shortsighted, ineffective, and chiefly harm legitimate users. If I go to the store and buy a LEGO set, that LEGO set is &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;. I don&amp;#39;t need to ask permission to use it. I don&amp;#39;t need to give the LEGO company a call when I want to put it together. They don&amp;#39;t (and shouldn&amp;#39;t) have any say over how I use my property. Once I&amp;#39;ve paid for it, it&amp;#39;s mine. That&amp;#39;s the way software should generally work too. Once I buy it, it&amp;#39;s mine and the creator should not interfere with my ability to use it. If they have problems with keeping people from stealing it, that&amp;#39;s their problem, not mine. If their authorization servers go down, suddenly I can&amp;#39;t use the product I paid for that I own, and now I&amp;#39;m the one suffering because of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; problem. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The people who pirate the software actually get the better deal here. They a superior version of the software. It won&amp;#39;t be crippled when it can&amp;#39;t be authorized. Companies can&amp;#39;t send it a message telling it to shut down or cease working. The people stealing the software are the ones &lt;em&gt;not affected&lt;/em&gt; by the antipiracy efforts. The only people antipiracy code affects are the ones who are legitimate paying users. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Trying to stop people form stealing your software via DRM (and other methods) is a natural, knee jerk reaction to the problem, but it&amp;#39;s not one that prioritizes the customers&amp;#39; experience, nor is it even effective.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many companies have even realized that it&amp;#39;s a good idea to give out software licenses for free (or very cheap). Students can get Photoshop super super cheap (or maybe free? I&amp;#39;m not sure) because Adobe realized that a large number of the people pirating it were students, and if they can get those people using their software when they&amp;#39;re younger then they will almost certainly use it professionally when they&amp;#39;re older. Rather than punish people who wanted to use it for cheap, they found a way to make it work for them to their benefit. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another notion that seems common on reddit is that corporations are evil who only want money and never did anything good for anyone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Again, this sort of goes back to my point about beliefs that are hard to falsify. If there are specific instances where you think that people were being unreasonably harsh toward the practices of a given business, that would be a more concrete discussion. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tech companies make life easier&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And sometimes they have shady practices with respect to private data and such that make them hard to trust, but without an example there&amp;#39;s nothing really to argue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;agribusiness helps feed an enormous and growing population&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;...while sometimes abusing the legal system and patents in anticompetitive ways&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;and healthcare, while grossly overpriced, provides better treatment options than at any time in history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;...and in the process bankrupts people ruining what life they have left. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All three of these examples could be a CMV on their own.

CMV: I think that rhetoric should take literature's place as a key subject in school.,"I see that there have been a couple of CMV's on here denying the importance of literature before, but most are effectively countered with arguments like ""you develop important language skills while learning about literature."" That's true, of course, but I think it would make much more sense to simply study the English language directly. Rhetoric as I understand it focuses on how language is used in the present, deals directly with common strategies of persuasion, and doesn't waste as much time on reading long books. An education in literature will also spend time to ensure that you able to understand archaic language, find hidden meaning in fictional stories, and identify important authors and books. I think that these skills are useful only if one pursues literature as a hobby, and so its study should not be more privileged than, say, film studies or music appreciation.  Judging from the way public schools are organized, I seem to be in a small minority on this view, and I don't really understand why. You can CMV if you can point out a useful skill taught by literature classes that would not be better studied in rhetoric or some other type of class. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

At their core, English classes are meant to teach students the English language. It is commonly accepted that the most effective means of learning a language is to become immersed in that language. English literature is, essentially, the deep, dark pool we English teachers use to immerse students in the language, for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is certainly possible to teach students all the individual pieces and parts of the language (and we do try) but this is akin to teaching musical notation without music. Students seem to retain so much more by simply being exposed to literature. It provides them with a static and proven example of the English language on which to build their own written communication skills. The human brain has an innate capacity to comprehend and mimic language and, because of this, giving students a chance to consume literature allows their brains to unconsciously soak up all the things that would have been lost and forgotten if it had been taught as theory.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I know that in my experience (both as a student and a teacher), nearly every obstacle a student might run into while learning the English language can be solved through more reading. Nearly all students who struggle in English are not readers in their free time (and are rarely readers even when their grade depends on it) and the students who do well in English classes are usually habitual readers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You also seem to be deeply underestimating how large a role rhetoric plays in the typical American public school. All the lessons you learned in school about writing and giving presentations were essentially tutorials in rhetoric without naming them as such. It could certainly be argued that rhetoric deserves more focus in schools, but I assure you that rhetoric is present in American education. I would also again argue that rhetoric can learned best through exposure to examples of effective rhetoric-- of which literature is one of the largest mediums to draw from.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether you realize it or not, you learned far more about effective written communication from reading literature than you did anywhere else. It might not have seemed like it at the time, or even in retrospect, but I can guarantee that you are better off for being forced to slog through literature-- even the literature filled with archaic language and hidden meanings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well firstly, I think rhetoric is fairly well covered in schools - at least when I took an advanced rhetoric class in college I was surprised to find that many of the concepts I was learning were not being introduced to me for the first time, just a better understanding of them. So I actually don&amp;#39;t really see anything that has to change here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Secondly, literature and rhetoric are two different things. Why can&amp;#39;t we teach both? The skills learned by studying literature apply to more then just art, you can do a &amp;quot;close reading&amp;quot; of anything. Literature provides cultural edification as well, something rhetoric can&amp;#39;t really tackle as a subject since it&amp;#39;s more focused on the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I guess I don&amp;#39;t understand why we need to replace literature with rhetoric when both are important. I also feel that rhetoric is taught fairly substantially in schools already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: Mark Wahlberg doesn't deserve a pardon.,"I was reading the news and came across an article stating that Mark Wahlberg - a very rich actor, producer and model -  is seeking out a presidential pardon for a series of crimes he committed in the 1980s.  **Crimes**  For those of you not familiar with the case: Wahlberg had been in trouble with police over 20 times in his youth and was addicted to drugs by the age of 13. When he was 15, he harassed, chased and threw rocks at two separate groups of black schoolchildren while yelling racial slurs at them. He basically got off with a warning for those two incidents.  When he was 16, he was involved in two separate, racially-motivated attacks on Vietnamese men. In the first attack, he beat a middle-aged man unconscious with a wooden stick while yelling slurs at him. Later the same day, he punched out another man and landed him in the hospital. Wahlberg was sentenced to 2 years in prison but only served 45 days.  In a separate incident, he attacked a neighbor without provocation and ended up breaking the man's jaw.  **Recent events**  Wahlberg has turned his life around. I don't think anyone can really deny that. He'd done philanthropic work, he's very involved in charity work, he's a devout Catholic and a devoted father. Not to mention he's a famous actor and producer who has worked on many movies.  He has recently requested a pardon for the crimes he committed when he was young. His victims are split on the issue: Some are still (understandably) angry and don't think he deserves a pardon, while others (including the child of one of his Vietnamese victims) believes he deserve one.  **Me**  I don't think he deserves a pardon.  I get it, he's turned his life around and he's probably a great guy now and all that. But hear me out:  1. I consider hate crimes a form of (small-scale) domestic terrorism. It says ""Your kind isn't wanted here"" and the implication is that, if you don't pack up and leave now, you could be next. It makes people scared to live out their daily lives, knowing that some unidentified man is going around attacking people of your race/ethnicity/religion/etc. I know there's a big debate over whether ""hate crime"" should even be its own classification, but personally, the fact that these attacks were racially motivated makes them even more heinous to me.  2. I don't see why Wahlberg deserves a pardon for multiple violent assaults when there are millions of other people who have similarly turned their life around after committing much less serious crimes (sometimes as a teenager, like Wahlberg was) but apparently don't deserve the same forgiveness.  3. He had 20 - 25 run-ins with the law. This was not a ""Whoops, I got caught up in something bad once or twice"". He had a pattern of committing crimes, including the five separate violent assaults. Not to mention he got off *extremely* easy anyway, having only served 45 days of a 2-year sentence.  So yeah. I just don't think he deserves or needs a pardon. I think he should stop talking about it and stop bringing attention to his past crimes. CMV? _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The point of it, though, is that even the villains are humans, who did this for a reason other than &amp;quot;they&amp;#39;re monsters&amp;quot;, and might not have done it (or, more importantly, might stop doing it) if it seemed like anyone cared.

CMV: Expecting an average citizen to be knowledgeable about ANY ONE topic is unreasonable.,"So I just watched this Last Week Tonight segment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEVlyP4_11M  It was entertaining, and while I agreed with a lot of it, what really pissed me off was the whole ""interviewing people on the street"" thing and the whole rabble about how ""the average person doesn't know or care.""  Fact of the matter is, most of us ""average people"" are specialists. We know an awful lot about a small segment of the world. I know about issues like net neutrality and government surveillance and dumb stuff like Sakawa because I hang around in those circles.  But if you asked me about just about anything else, I'd give some vague or hilariously misinformed response. Conflict in the Middle East? ""Yeah, that's been going on forever and'll never get resolved. People fighting over the Gaza Strip or something, idk."" Gay rights? ""Social progress is being made. I'm sure we'll all have equality soon enough. Uganda has some horrific laws.""  I'm exaggerating, but you get the idea.  Or stuff like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4MwTvtyrUQ Of course, to me it seems crazy to not know what a web browser is, but really, expecting the average person on the street to tell you what a web browser is an unreasonable expectation, the same way I dunno anything about my car engine or about plumbing aside from how to use a plunger.  Instead, what we expect is that everyone specializes in some stuff and those specialists take care of that stuff for us. The computer engineer writes the software for the plumber, and the plumber fixes the computer engineer's pipes.  The most obvious counterargument that comes to mind is ""policy is about what government can do to everyone, as citizens. As citizens, we all have an obligation to know about how policy affects us."" But I don't think that's valid because there's just FAR, FAR too much policy for any person to know about. People just have to pick and choose the few issues they care most about. And statistically, the chances of two people who care about the same issues meeting at random are just really small.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Also, in a world where we are constantly on our phones and computers it is reasonable to expect someone to have a general idea about the Middle East conflicts and the stuff going on Indiana.

I believe that the realistic opportunity to mitigate and adapt to human-driven climate change passed us at least 5-10 years ago and that we are now doomed to a long-term worldwide decline and a total collapse of civilization within the next 100-200 years. CMV,"From what I've read (e.g. [here](http://137.205.102.156/Ms%20S%20J%20Pain/20111124/Kevin_Anderson_-_Flash_%28Medium%29_-_20111124_05.26.31PM.html), or [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7ktYbVwr90)), in order to have any chance of worldwide warming of under 2°C, carbon emissions would have to peak in 7 years and fall by at least 10% every year after that (we're currently rising at about 3-4% per year). And warming of 4°C would almost certainly kick off natural positive feedback mechanisms that would cause warming to continue up to 12°C. At that point, most of the planet would be too hot for a human being to survive standing outside ([source](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/21/9552.full)). So I think the opportunity for any kind of stable climate has passed us by, and the climate will continue to warm until civilization cannot be sustained.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if such pesimistic predictions were true, I dont think a slow 10C warming it would lead to total collapse of civilisation. We would have time to adapt through technology and migration. Yes, equatorial countries would become very hot (altrough perhaps not uninhabitable), but Siberia, Greenland or Antarctica would in turn become habitable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, there are some more exotic geoengineering proposals that can help us avert or slow down the warming even if there is no CO2 emissions reduction: &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering#Solar_radiation_management""&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_engineering#Solar_radiation_management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m assuming that you believe that humans are responsible for climate change. I&amp;#39;d like to challenge a few points and raise a few of my own. For one thing, the earth has heated up and cooled down many times in the past. The age in which the dinosaurs lived was much warmer than today&amp;#39;s climate and CO2 levels were naturally higher. The earth eventually cooled down, and CO2 levels naturally decreased. Then we have ice ages. The earth has naturally recovered from such temperature changes all on it&amp;#39;s own. I honestly don&amp;#39;t think humans are causing global warming and cooling based on the fact that it has happened time and time again in the past without any human involvement. Just because a large amount of people think it&amp;#39;s true doesn&amp;#39;t make it true. Also, global warming isn&amp;#39;t a cause of concern for me. Warmer overall temperatures eventually lead to greater diversity of plant and animal life, and just because some species will be unable to adapt doesn&amp;#39;t mean greater diversity will arise in the aftermath.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"I think some countries (like mine) are not yet ready for full Democracy, as they would be better with something else - CMV","I live in Italy. Recently there has been certain events that made me thought that we are seriously heading in the wrong direction. And it's all about the citizens. Since about 9 years, italians can't choose their own representants as parties changed the law so that lists are ""fixed"". Italy is one of the the last countries in western Europe for education quality, corruption level, freedom of word, economic freedom. Debt is huge and has been created by giving out free money to companies and creating temporary jobs. Most italians still don't have access to fast broadband; the biggest telco in Italy owns 99% of it and asks the State to cover expenses for broadband infrastructures over 1mbps, while offers the worst prices for it of all Europe and stops competition from entering the market.  Right-wing spend most of its time defending Silvio Berlusconi from trials and self perceived plots by justice, while he owns most italian medias and indirectly controlled public television for years. Berlusconi is so important that when our Supreme Court announced he would be judged on July 30th, they asked to close the Parliament for some days. He also recently used its power to stop the reassignation of a TV frequency, and Italy spent under a billion euros in fines because of that. In the early 00s he escaped jail by depenalizing his own crime.  Left-wing is perceived as inept, self focused and simply caring only about getting Berlusconi out of parliament. Left-wing managed to win (by 0.5%) elections, yet can't rule the country without Berlusconi because they don't have the majority of the Parliament and the other party won't ally with them - yet it is blaming left-wing and right-wing (""it's a coup d'était by banks and hidden lobbies!"") and asking to rule alone with full powers; this party wants Italy to give out money to every citizen without a job and cut down almost completely wages of public servants.   Taxation is over 50% while tax evasion is so high that probably 1/3 of italians don't pay taxes. Most people under 25 years don't work. Only 1 italian in 4 has a degree; most of them are completely useless or regarded as obstacles to getting underqualified jobs. Young people rarely have a stable job and live alone, as they need help from parents (often economic help).   The biggest industry in the country (FIAT) is not competitive and blames a trade union for its inettitude on the markets. It is also moving production to countries like Poland after decennial sussidies from government.  Recently the right-wing banned organ transplantations from animals, so we can eat them but not save people with them. It's rare that a doctor practice abortion in our country. There is still no protection for LGBT couples. Catholic religion is a subject in schools.       tl;dr (???): my country is incredibly fucked up and I blame people for that. Change my opinion that democracy, in countries like mine, is worst than an illuminated monarchy. I'm not saying we are better with fascism, I'm saying we need someone that won't get influenced by shit. People can't understand or don't want to understand how economy works, what is the State and why we should respect it; there is no collective memory, no sense of dignity and honor in politics, morality is ridicolized. I think we're better with a monarch that would call bullshit on politicians and actively improve our culture, or some sort of oligarchy with skilled people instead of politicians. But I love socialdemocracy and want more power in the hands of people and not lobbies; yet I don't think they'd do a good job with it.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;parties changed the law so that lists are &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; mean the Italian people are not ready for Democracy?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;my country is incredibly fucked up and I blame people for that&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; -- Why? If the election laws are fixed why is that the fault of the people? Why is it the fault of the Left that they can&amp;#39;t win a clear majority when the elections are clearly rigged?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have a democracy, why is even less democracy a solution? Why don&amp;#39;t you try holding free and fair elections for a change before you do something unbelievably stupid like installing a dictator?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to challenge some of OP&amp;#39;s sense of &amp;quot;democracy.&amp;quot; I found in undergrad that most people speak of &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot; as equivalent to elections. But it takes more than voting for citizens to participate as equals in the processes of decision-making (the wikipedia definition of democracy).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here are some other elements that have had some importance in young representative democracies:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a balance of powers&lt;/strong&gt; - After the election, does the winner control every branch of government? If so, then the government will probably have problems with the peaceful transfer of power, or at least the continuous operation of basic governmental services. &lt;strong&gt;An alternative&lt;/strong&gt; is to differentiate the selection and powers of certain institutions of government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;coalition-building&lt;/strong&gt; - After the election, does the side with the plurality get to rule as the majority?  If so, then the minority-majority has a perverse incentive to divide the opposition, rather than govern for the majority. &lt;strong&gt;An alternative&lt;/strong&gt; is to require a majority to govern, or cooperation between multiple institutions within the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;non-elective powers&lt;/strong&gt; - Is the elected government the only force with nation-wide power? If so, then it may have no referees. &lt;strong&gt;Some alternatives&lt;/strong&gt; include a free press, private institutions of power, international referees, civic or religious unity movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a culture of compromise&lt;/strong&gt; - Does your nation have a culture of vendettas, long-term grudges, or vengeance? If so, then you may have explosive fights surrounding your government that escalate far beyond the point of reason. &lt;strong&gt;An alternative&lt;/strong&gt; is a non-elected body of mediators who can set binding terms for a peace between factions, such as private mediators, international courts, or trusted civic or religious authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; Democracy has a broader sense--equal participation in government--that requires more than elections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
[CMV] Penmanship should not be taught/compulsory in school,"In my opinion penmanship should not be taught in school because:  1: Handwriting is becoming more and more irrelevant by the minute  2: Children do not enjoy handwriting in the slightest!  3: Children are better at typing  4: Children LOVE computers in learning  5: Children actually enjoy typing  6: It is possible to get marked incorrectly in a test just because they have bad handwriting  7: Schools tend to have a tight budget, and i feel like teaching something that will be more relevant when the child is older would be more beneficial (like programming)  [This may be biased because i believe that handwriting/penmanship is the devil]  EDIT: Added note that I may be biased. EDIT 2: Spelling","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not really trying to change your view, but here are my two cents, feel free to reply.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handwriting is becoming more irrelevant yes, but all of the children in this and most likely next generation will still need to use it. Handwriting and drawing also help parts of the brain develop. Until we all have tablets/smartphones/laptops, handwriting will stay. There are also studies that show handwriting helps improve the parts of the brain with spelling more so than when typing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not “all” do. I’ve met kids who actually liked writing cursive. If I can find kids at my age at the time who liked cursive, then I’m sure there’s other kids who don’t mind writing things out by hand. Don’t forget lots of college and high school kids still hand write their notes and don’t use laptops to type the notes down. Not all to common, but it’s still quite prevalent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily, but starting them earlier by at least age 7-10 will ensure them to type at least 60-75 WPM when they are adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children love anything special when learning. My favourite thing was the TV on wheels with the VHS tapes and Jeopardy math games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure I agree with you, most will see that after memorizing the keyboard layout, they can type 3-10x faster than hand writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mistakes happen, but handwriting is better for spelling anyways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something that I’d want to see, but probably won’t see until 10-20 years from now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like most things that are good for them, children lack the foresight, knowledge and responsibility to self invest themselves in things. It’s why we all hated school and thought it was stupid. (at least most of us) Eventually we grow up and realize sometimes things are just needed. Handwriting is very vital to our society and probably will be forever to be honest. The cognitive development +&amp;#39;s from just handwriting is good enough reason to teach it to kids still these days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Children do not enjoy handwriting in the slightest!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most children don&amp;#39;t seem to enjoy school in general, so I&amp;#39;m not sure that point counts. I&amp;#39;m also tempted to call out the claim that &amp;quot;children actually enjoy typing,&amp;quot; because there was a severe lack of excited kids in my keyboarding class way back in eight grade.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, penmanship is still important, just maybe not as important to some positions these days. A major reason to keep teaching children how to write legibly is because it helps improve basic motor skills like hand-eye coordination. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Constantly writing actually made me a better speller, too. I&amp;#39;m not sure if this is true for everyone, but if we&amp;#39;re comparing writing to simply reading, it seems like it&amp;#39;d be easier to remember how to spell a word correctly after writing it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Writing (or penmanship, whatever term you want to use) has a lot of benefits when it comes to literacy that may not always be immediately noticeable. And also, I really hate to be &amp;quot;that guy,&amp;quot; but I have to point out that four of your points are essentially saying &amp;quot;kids don&amp;#39;t enjoy this but like that, so let&amp;#39;s just do what they enjoy.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I&amp;#39;m sure programming is going to be beneficial to a lot of those kids when they get older. As beneficial as learning good handwriting skills? I&amp;#39;m not so sure, especially if handwriting does have benefits when it comes literacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I believe that .9 repeating does NOT equal 1 and is representative of a serious flaw in decimal notation.

EDIT2: [jsmooth7](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1xrors/i_believe_that_9_repeating_does_not_equal_1_and/cfe42mb) has provided sufficient detail for the voodoo to make sense. thank you everyone for participating in this madness.   I believe that any infinitely repeating number is essentially a bug in the decimal system.  1/3 != .33...  1/9 != .11...  Using a concept (""infinity"", ""zero"") as if it were an actual quanity lends to this error.    * ze·ro - noun - no quantity or number  * in·fin·i·ty - noun - the state or quality of being infinite  * in·fi·nite - adjective - limitless or endless in space, extent, or size; impossible to measure or calculate.  0 represents a state of no value. Identifying this state as a number makes equations suddenly not work right.  x = 0  11*0 = 0  11x = x  11 = 1  I believe the same situation occurs when using ""infinity"" as if it were an actual quantity instead of a concept. If something is ""impossible to calculate"" then how can it be used to represent an actual value?  In closing, I can see how it ""effectively equals 1"" in such a way that, if you were dealing with money and had $99.99999999999999999, it is close enough that no one would care if you simply said ""$100"" (see: 'Office Space'). That does not however change the fact that it is not ACTUALLY $100.  I like math and numbers because they behave in predictable ways. 1+1 will never be 3. This doesn't sit right with me and my view almost feels like some kind of atheism because I don't just accept it as fact on faith.  Please please CMV.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you taken any calculus? In calculus 2, you learn rules and theorems for working with infinite sums, a field of mathematics that is very well supported and commonly applied to the real world. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the theorems is that any series of the form x/(r&lt;sup&gt;n)&lt;/sup&gt; converges to a real value if r &amp;gt; 1. You can write 0.999... as an infinite sum of this form, and prove that it equals 1: &lt;a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+from+1+to+infinity+of+%289*10%5E%28-n%29%29""&gt;http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+from+1+to+infinity+of+%289*10^%28-n%29%29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Any number of nines you could write in 0.999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 would not represent 1, but a number very close to 1.

A never ending decimal represents an infinite sum. For example: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;0.33333... = 3/10+3/100+3/1000+...&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;3.14159... = 3 + 1/10 + 4/100+ 1/1000+...&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now these infinite sums have exact, fixed values. 0.3333... is not effectively 1/3, it is exactly 1/3. This is something we can actually calculate. (I can go into more detail about the calculation if you would like.) There is nothing wishy-washy about it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately though, decimal numbers are not unique, since the infinite sum 9/10+9/100+9/1000...=1. That means 0.9999... = 1. But this is not a serious flaw, because all we have to do is only use decimals that don&amp;#39;t end in infinite 9s. As long as we do that every decimal will represent a unique real number.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"I don't like living in America, and I want to leave. Please CMV.","I'm a 19 y/o male living in the Pacific Northwest. I am really tired of living in America for several reasons.  * 1) Healthcare is screwed up. I am fairly healthy, and I cannot schedule a Dr. appointment because I have not been to the doctor in a long time. Because of regulations implemented by our healthcare reforms, I would have to go through the process that every new patient goes through, and this would cost $$$ and take weeks. I have bad eyes, and I need new glasses. My University schedule won't allow me to make an appointment at the eye doctor covered by my parents insurance, so I will have to wear old glasses until I can squeeze in a check-up in a visit to home. I can't just find an eye-doctor and get looked at. Fuck.   * 2) Our education system is terrible. I was lucky enough to be homeschooled by my parents, and have easily kept up with, and surpassed my peers through my first two years of college. I was about the top 15 in my school at the end of my sophomore year. Students who spent 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 14 years were dropping out of intro classes because they didn't have the study skills and prior knowledge.   A large portion of the school year here is spent preparing students for specific standardized tests, instead of teaching them real-world skills.  Also, education here is extremely expensive. I was lucky enough to have two of four years paid for, cheap rent, scholarships, and generous parents, and I will still have &gt; $10,000 in debt when I graduate. Then, I have to find a job, which brings us to . . .  * 3) Our economy, which is terrible. I know Europe is suffering to, as well as the rest of the globe, so this isn't going to be solved by leaving America, but we are run by greedy politicians that put us deeper and deeper into debt, while unemployment goes up and up. I work at a grocery store, and a massive amount of people rely on government programs to buy their basic food and toiletries. This is sad.  * 4) I hate the culture, especially among the youth, here in America. I know I would likely find this same culture anywhere else in the world. It's full of people obsessed with sex and the latest celebrity gossip. No one has serious conversations, and most stay glued to their phones.   I might sound pessimistic here, but I really am lucky to be living in a (somewhat) free and safe country, and I've been blessed withe great parents and friends. I would just like some perspective as to why America isn't as bad as it seems to me. Change my view! ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;1) Healthcare is screwed up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no getting around this. America spends more money on private insurance as well as public insurance than any other country of similar economic development. Twice as much for no better care. Some may argue that our elective surgeries are better off but, realistically speaking, having a knee replacement within a week of deciding you want one is less important than going bankrupt from life-saving but routine care. Having an appendectomy can quickly escalate to nearly $100k in cost if you don&amp;#39;t have adequate health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Things will get better in the future because of Maslow&amp;#39;s Heirarchy of Needs. If people don&amp;#39;t have what they see as necessary, we&amp;#39;ll get off of our asses and do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;2) Our education system is terrible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is, but mostly with the primary education system. Standardized tests instead of real world skills are important because it teaches you processes. Learning things hands on at a job is the best way to learn real world skills. The background I have in education is largely useless because it&amp;#39;s extremely vague, i.e. &amp;quot;forest&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;trees&amp;quot;. That&amp;#39;s a good thing, however. You can&amp;#39;t let education become too focused when you ideally want people to keep their labor as liquid as possible. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;3) Our economy, which is terrible&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a staunch socialist so I&amp;#39;ll have things shaded in a certain light here. Anyway, every country has some level of fucked built in and if they&amp;#39;re not at the same level of fucked as America, they&amp;#39;re quickly headed that way. The liberalization of economies is happening all over the world. Even our neighbors to the north are seeing the ramifications of a liberal economic model. The country is almost entirely dependent on oil exports and the rest of the economy is seen as a subsidy or a potential subsidy. Their healthcare system is being gutted and their environment is seen as an obstacle to profit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Is SNAP/WIC bad? Sure, but at the same time it is about Maslow&amp;#39;s heirarchy again. If people don&amp;#39;t have food, they&amp;#39;ll be in the streets rioting. We can either admit that full unemployment is at 5% is bad or we can keep with the welfare state to see that citizens are provided for along with keeping growth potential for companies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hate the culture, especially among the youth, here in America. I know I would likely find this same culture anywhere else in the world. It&amp;#39;s full of people obsessed with sex and the latest celebrity gossip. No one has serious conversations, and most stay glued to their phones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re just seeing it first-hand and seeing culture cherry picked from elsewhere. Everyone&amp;#39;s culture is pretty undeniably shitty, just in their own novel way. Pobody&amp;#39;s nerfect. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All in all, the best reason to leave is to grow yourself as a person. If you went and lived in Istanbul for a decade you may or may not like living in Turkey, but I can pretty much guarantee that the unique experience of living in both countries will make your life more enjoyable no matter what country you&amp;#39;re living in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Heathcare is indeed screwed up. It&amp;#39;s probably going to change a few time in the coming years. However, every country has problems with healthcare. Are their countries with better healthcare systems? Yes. Are their countries with worse ones? Incredibly so.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) I gather you&amp;#39;re talking about K-12 education. It could definitely be better, and probably will do so as we begin to implement new psychology and sociology research into the education system.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As far as college. &lt;a href=""http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2013#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=""&gt;The US has some of the best colleges in the world by far.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) Our economy is terrible? Relatively, our economy is still the best in the world. I suppose you could argue that there are a few other countries with better economies, but in the end, they&amp;#39;re all severely dependent on the US, especially militarily. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4) No you don&amp;#39;t. You hate some aspects of culture. Everyone hates some aspects of their own culture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;America is not obsessed with sex. Pop music culture might be. Cinema culture might be but... for the most part, it&amp;#39;s just a tiny part of life, not an obsession.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for the &amp;quot;latest celebrity gossip.&amp;quot; Again, that&amp;#39;s a tiny part of life. You&amp;#39;re focusing on it, which makes it seem like a bigger problem than it is. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for serious conversations.... what do you consider this to be? The internet is part of your culture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Why don&amp;#39;t you have them in your daily &amp;quot;real-world&amp;quot; life? Because that&amp;#39;s a really bad medium for serious conversations. There&amp;#39;s no anonymity, no sourcing of claims, claims based on faulty memories, and of course the fact that you need to have discussions in real time, rather than being able to think it out like when the discussion is online. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You picked out things about your culture you don&amp;#39;t like, and then said you don&amp;#39;t like the culture. There are millions of things about your culture. Just by being raised in the culture, 2 things pretty much always happen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) You are so used to things, that they are just considered &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) You focus on the things that are changing for the &amp;quot;worse&amp;quot; and complain about them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I know this sounds rude, but it&amp;#39;s just human nature to do these things. We compare our world to a fictional utopia in our heads, and then complain about how our world isn&amp;#39;t perfect. We fail to realize the practical problems that would occur under alternative systems, mainly because these systems are just so complicated that we can&amp;#39;t really see the practical problems until after they&amp;#39;ve already occured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: I believe that college athletes should be held to the same admissions criteria as all other students.,"From an ESPN article titled, ""Exemptions Benefit Athletes"", it is stated that, ""77 of the 92 Football Bowl Subdivision schools that provided information to the AP reported using special admissions waivers to land athletes and other students with particular talents.""   Special admissions waivers are approved by the NCAA in order to allow athletes who would not typically meet the admissions requirements to be accepted to a college (different colleges have different special admissions requirements).   I believe that this is wrong, as college is defined first and foremost as ""a building for an educational purpose"" (Webster). The purpose of attending college is to receive an education. To admit students under different admissions requirements (because without them those athletes wouldn't be able to attend said college) is wrong, as it demonstrates that the college is not seeking to have these students represent them as an academic institution as they should be, rather as an athletic enterprise.   All students whether they are athletes or not should be held to the same admissions criteria as this will make the admissions process more competitive, and athletes who are able to get into schools without special admissions waivers will prove their dedication to education, versus athletics, as it should be.

Do you feel like this worsens your education? Or devalues you accomplishments to employers and others? It kind of just seems like you are salty because you didn&amp;#39;t get special treatment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You say that a students goal is to gain an education out of college, but I would argue that that is a by product of what they really want to gain; which is whatever they feel is best for them. For most students this is getting a degree/skills which will get them a good job. In the case of athletes is doing whatever lands them in a professional league. Engineering programs give students the skills and qualifications to be an Engineer. NCAA Football programs give (some) students the skills and qualifications to become NFL players.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also you say college athletes but what you really mean is football players (and maybe basketball players). But the NCAA has dozens of sports which don&amp;#39;t make any money for their schools. I very much doubt that college&amp;#39;s are giving high school golf prodigies special admissions (but I may be wrong). You are talking about a TINY number of people, Alabama allowed 19 guys in over 3 admission periods, they have ~35k students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone here seems to be talking about the money aspect of things, but I think the educational aspect is a more convincing argument. Education does not mean academic learning. It just means you are learning something. College isn&amp;#39;t inherently about learning academically, it&amp;#39;s mostly about learning a useful skill or set of knowledge that you can build a career on. Many universities have majors for music, acting, arts, and all sorts of non academic things. So when you consider that many popular sports are million and billion dollar industries, it actually makes sense to have sports as a program in college. A successful football player in high school is not likely to rake in millions of dollars of ad revenue straight out of graduation. 90% of the time he will have to hone his skills and attract attention in a college football program. When athletes enter college on a scholarship, they are going there to learn a trade, one which is actually much MORE competitive and requires more exceptional natural talent and training than the vast majority of fields offered at the university level. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you think that athletes are the exception to the rule in terms of admissions putting less emphasis on academic merit, you should interview some people to went to school on a music scholarship. It&amp;#39;s incredibly different than getting a degree in biology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you still question the logic behind it, just try to imagine what the consequences of removing that system would be. All the athletes who failed to meet the academic rigor of students who are actually trying to enter a highly technical field would never be discovered. Sports would have less exceptional players. If a completely non academic alternative to college arose for sports training, you would be discouraging intelligent athletes from learning. Maybe you personally don&amp;#39;t care about those types of consequences, but perhaps you can at least see how many people have a very strong interest in allowing athletes into college based more on their potential to become successful than on their traditional academic merits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I think that Northerners are smarter and more educated than Southerners (in the United States). CMV.,"The reasons why I believe this are that the great majority of creationists and religious fundamentalists are from the South, and many of the horribly stupid politicians that we've seen over the past ten or so years have been propped up by their Southern supporters.  Racism and homophobia also seem to be much more prominent in the South than in the North.  I hate generalizing people like this and would really like for someone to successfully change my view; I just can't help but think of the South like this at the moment.  ~~NOTE: The title may be a bit miss leading because I don't believe that **all** Northerners are smarter than every single Southerner, but I do think that, on average, the North has an advantage.~~  **EDIT:** Strike intelligence out of the title.  I have no foundation of proof for that and shouldn't have included it.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey I can help here.  I&amp;#39;ve lived and worked in the South/Midwest and the Northeast, as an adult, for 3+ years each.  (Texas/Northern Florida + Maryland/DC).  I feel like this puts me in a unique position to give some insight here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is a culture in a lot of the South and the Midwest that leads people to believe in the religious things you&amp;#39;ve mentioned, harbor sometimes extreme right political views and generally not appreciate or respect intelligence and higher education.  These people tend to be less formally educated and put less stress on critical thinking, reason, etc.  So in other words, a lot of what you perceive the South to be is true, but the people aren&amp;#39;t born less intelligent or with less capability, its just a culture thing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One thing people from the South have going for them though that you don&amp;#39;t see in the North as much is a more pragmatic worldview and a better understanding of the connection between human nature/human behavior.  This is a byproduct of the conservative culture they were brought up in, and depending on the definition of intelligence, could make them more so (at least in some ways.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You ever beamed a Nutria with a .22? That in and of itself is pretty hard, but you ever killed one with a .22? Do you then know how to dress and clean a nutria so that it can be food? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Can you service a tractor? do you know whats wrong with a diesel engine simply based on its sound? Do you know how fucking hard dynamite fishing is?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here is the thing, education funding in the south has always been abysmal, They are relying on teaching their children with a PALTRY amount of money and state support. So in one sense you are completely correct. They are more educated, but education and intelligence are two different things. And there is more than one kind of intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The examples I provided seem like offensive stereotypes right? They are there for a reason. The South hosts one of the largest percentage of the population living under the poverty line in the US. Not many people know how hard it is, and how, well, crafty (in the actual sense of the word) you have to be in order to survive. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Making money comes down to either working 3 jobs, selling to your neighbors, or breaking the law. Contrary to popular belief, every meal isn&amp;#39;t KFC south of the Mason-Dixon, no, you look for the best possible deal at Wal-Mart (Costco Cards are expensive). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of those pictures subtitles &amp;quot;Only in Alabama&amp;quot;? The ones with the patched together trucks made out of a Civic and the rear end of a Hylux? If you have a truck in any rural area, you have a marketeable work skill. Transporting mulch for 2 dollars an hour for an 8 hour shift is enough to get a small dinner to your family of 8. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Its easy, in a land of comparative plenty, to look at the south and say, &amp;quot;Well why the hell would you go and do that&amp;quot;, but the mere fact that they could says something for ingenuity in the face of poverty. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Try sticking a northerner (By the way, thats just northwest and northeast, the education problems of the midwest are almost as bad as the South&amp;#39;s) in the south, give them 50 dollars a week for food, rent, utilities, and see how they cope.

CMV: Homeless people are homeless because they don't try not to be.,"Idk.  I just feel like (in my town at least) I see all sorts of ""homeless"" people who stand on the street corner begging for money.  On the strip of road that they beg on there are at least 35 businesses that hire all forms of work.  Sure, they're minimum wage, but with the twelve hours a day you spend standing outside begging for money why don't you get a fucking job and find yourself some housing?  Also, they all drink and smoke.  Not sure if that's the case everywhere, but they literally don't seem to give a fuck.  My view:  Homeless people are homeless by choice - sure, they may have had an incident that forces them out of their home, but then they keep themselves homeless by giving up and falling into despair.  I do not give money to the homeless. I do not believe sheltering them is the right thing to do.  I think giving them proper psychological counselling and a job application is more important.    Am I wrong in thinking this way?  Does anyone here personally know some homeless folks and can attest to their reasons for being homeless?  I don't want just any old schmuck trying to change my view here - you don't know their circumstances any better than I do.  CMV.  Or don't CMV.  Maybe people agree with me?  I guess I'm not sure how I should feel about this.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I grew up in a stagnant railroad town where transient homeless people drifted in and out constantly, and I befriended a number of them over the years helping out at my family&amp;#39;s store by the train station. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With most homeless people, it just isn&amp;#39;t as simple as giving them some counseling and handing them a job application. You have to understand that your average homeless person didn&amp;#39;t just wake up one morning, quit their job, move out of their apartment, and start sleeping in the street. Rather, they typically have faced combination of problems over years and years that led them to where they are. Many of them have serious mental health issues (not the kind of thing that can be fixed by some therapy sessions and a bottle of pills) including severe schizophrenia and PTSD (why you see so many homeless veterans). Many of them have serious issues with substance abuse including everything from alcoholism to meth or heroin addiction. Many of them come from a history of being abused and neglected as children. Most of them probably have some combination of all of the above.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As such, helping a homeless person dig their way out of a hole dug by a lifetime of very serious problems is almost never as simple as telling them to pick themselves up by their bootstraps and get a job. Helping them off the streets and onto a better life is possible for many of them, but it takes a careful and persistent approach. For example, I have a friend who used to be a social worker in Utah, and she explained to me a very successful program for homeless people in which the state essentially just gives them apartments. At first glance, it seems as though it wouldn&amp;#39;t be very effective, but it has actually had huge success in reducing homelessness in the state. The reason for this, according to my friend, is that someone can&amp;#39;t fail out of the program. If you take a homeless person and give them ultimatums like &amp;quot;stay clean from drugs and alcohol&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hold down this job for a month&amp;quot;, they are almost guaranteed to mess up and will be kicked back to the streets after a week. However, if you work with them and give them the opportunity to make mistakes and correct them, over time you can help a lot of them find their way back into society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been homeless three times now -- and I assure you that &lt;em&gt;almost nobody&lt;/em&gt; is homeless by choice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all about resource management.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You see, each homeless person realized one day that he was unable to come up with the money needed for everything.  Each story is different but the thing most of those stories have in common is the realization that you can live in a car but you can&amp;#39;t drive an apartment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the first stage of homelessness is typically couch surfing with friends or family.  But for those who cant, for whatever reason, do that -- well they end up living out of their cars.  And even the couch surfers generally end up at Camp Toyota after a short period of time anyway.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re homeless though they often still have jobs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You might not even realize they&amp;#39;re homeless.  In fact, I dare say you know at least one homeless person and don&amp;#39;t have the slightest clue they&amp;#39;re homeless.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But living out of your car is difficult.  You have to hide the fact that you&amp;#39;re living in your car because it is not generally allowed.  That means that you have to go to sleep very late each night.  It also means you have to spend a significant amount of time finding somewhere to use the bathroom and to shower.  Oh yeah, and you don&amp;#39;t get very restful sleep in your car.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So even if you have a job to begin with, you&amp;#39;re starting to look a bit haggard after a short period of time.  You haven&amp;#39;t slept.  You&amp;#39;re struggling to keep yourself presentable but showers are hard to come by.  You don&amp;#39;t have a bathroom mirror at your disposal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And by now, your employer is becoming less and less happy with you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Oh sure, you&amp;#39;re really trying to hold it together -- but damn, everything is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much harder now.  And sometimes it takes months before you lose that job -- but you&amp;#39;re going to lose it.  After all, you&amp;#39;ve been working as well as spending several hours per day just trying to find somewhere to shit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; costs far more when you&amp;#39;re homeless.  You can&amp;#39;t cook so every meal is at a restaurant.  You might, as I did, move into a hotel.  But that eats up pretty much your whole paycheck (I did this for years).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And at this point, absolutely anything that goes wrong is catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The day you lose your job you&amp;#39;re pretty much hosed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now you don&amp;#39;t have the means to do laundry.  Or shower.  So you have a very short window in which you might pick up another job.  If you miss that window you&amp;#39;re not likely to bounce back without anybody&amp;#39;s help.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But you don&amp;#39;t know that yet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re still hopeful and you keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But eventually you figure out that it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to get enough to get by:  dollar menu items, a pack of cigarettes, maybe a bottle of beer.  Yeah, the cigarettes and beer may seem wasteful to somebody with somewhere to sleep -- but it&amp;#39;s not like you had a choice between having a home and smoking. You had a choice between a value meal and a pack of cigarettes and two McDoubles.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And heaven forbid someone jacks your ID.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you find yourself without an ID, the world just got very narrow for you.  You can&amp;#39;t even do day labor -- which btw, is how many homeless people get by. They&amp;#39;re working, but not every day because it&amp;#39;s pointless to work every day on three hours of uneasy sleep at Camp Toyota.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And somewhere around this time your car insurance lapses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So now your home (your car) is in constant jeopardy.  The first time you get pulled over, your home is history.  Oh sure, they&amp;#39;ll let you go to the impound yard to collect your belongings -- but you&amp;#39;re leaving on foot.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With everything you own on your back.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How open are potential employers to hiring you?  Precisely equal to the average person&amp;#39;s willingness to help you out with cash:  at nearly zero.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#39;ve reached the point that people can tell you&amp;#39;re homeless, ain&amp;#39;t nobody giving you a job.  Well, maybe.  But it&amp;#39;s not likely. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When you see someone who has been reduced to the point of begging you&amp;#39;re not looking at someone who doesn&amp;#39;t want to work, have a home, clothes, fresh food, and someone to love.  You&amp;#39;re seeing someone who has so many roadblocks standing before him that for right now if he can get a sandwich and a bottle of beer or coca cola, he can relax for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I have money and a homeless person begs for some of it, I reach in my pocket and grab one bill and immediately hand it over without looking at it.  Sometimes it has been a $100 bill and it has stung a little bit to hand it over.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whenever they say something like &amp;quot;I promise I&amp;#39;m going to spend this on food&amp;quot;, I always tell them that it&amp;#39;s none of my business what they spend &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; money on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t give them a home, but I can give them a fleeting moment of dignity (the first thing they lost when they started circling the drain).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: A lot of economists are just glorified fortune tellers,"I think that a lot of economists are like glorified fortune tellers. They know a lot of complex formulas and terminology, but how good are these formulas and terminology at predicting future prices/events? Are these complex formulas really useful, or is it that they are confusing enough for average people not to question them, and to view them as ""scientific.""  Are they actually making accurate predictions, or is it just comforting for companies/governments/investors to think that they can predict the future of the economy. Some economists (like fortune tellers) make accurate predictions, but when you have so many people trying to predict what will happen in the future, your bound to have at least one of them predict it correctly.

Why do you think they wouldn&amp;#39;t be? What economists are trying to do is describe how a group of people allocate scarce resources. Already a tremendously difficult problem. Now add in elements of imperfect competition, imperfect information, irrationality, consumers and firms that &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt;, how they act when predicting the actions of others, and so on. How could you possibly model all this and compare the model to the real world &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; linear algebra and differential equations and incredibly complex statistical methods? If you think you have a better way, by all means, share it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I think that economics as of late may be veering a bit to far towards pointless maths, this is certainly no conspiracy by economists to keep the general public from understanding anything. Trust me, if I could do away with all the misconceptions of economics held by the public, I would do it in a heartbeat. Why would I feel any differently? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Secondly, economists, the real ones at least, do not claim to be able to predict the future perfectly accurately any more than the weatherman does. In the business world, most economic analysts I know (and I know quiet a few) try to be very honest about the predictive capabilities of their models. I know I do. More often than not though (at least in my experience, which is limited), the other party just doesn&amp;#39;t listen. Doesn&amp;#39;t care. They want the recommendation and nothing else. It isn&amp;#39;t my fault if other people don&amp;#39;t want to hear about uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With regard to the media though, yes. Economic predictions are presented as being far more accurate than they actually are, especially when you consider the media most often reports on predictions (such as predictions of GDP growth) which are notoriously inaccurate. I don&amp;#39;t know whether this is the fault of the economists though, or of the media. What do you think? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, I think you ignore applications of economic theory that generally work. For example, central banks are very good at using their influence over interest rates and inflation. When they decide to take on a policy, they usually accomplish it. Whether that policy is good for the economy is another matter entirely (it usually is), but there are several other examples of economic predictions that generally work as expected. Can you think of any economic predictions besides those for difficult-to-predict macroeconomic variables like unemployment or GDP growth that are often wildly inaccurate or imprecise? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You seem to be working from a very wrong starting point, that economic models are inaccurate, they aren&amp;#39;t. They are in fact quite accurate. The problems with economics arise when politicians decide they can get creative with the numbers, the media reinterpret the numbers to rile up an economically illiterate public or good old fear and panic grips the population. None of which are in the scope of any science to predict. The truth is that economics is very complex and to get a good picture of anything you need to have advanced knowledge of the science. Knowing what a GDP is, alone, tells you nothing. But if you can combine it with a deep knowledge of elasticity of demand, income distribution and the role of government and supply, then yeah, you can then make some pretty awesome predictions. You see the problem I assume, all of that is far too complex for the untrained to understand in any kind of mass media we use today. Which means it gets dumbed down. Which gives the public a very wrong idea of what economics can and can&amp;#39;t be used to predict. For example, your little bit bout predicting price/events. That&amp;#39;s deeply flawed. For one you seem to be pointing at specific price points... That&amp;#39;s not what models do. Model&amp;#39;s tell you what kind of price is associated with what kind of economic outlook. Frankly, I suspect you don&amp;#39;t really know what economists really do and are mixing them up with financial analysts... Economic models are not predictive in the sense that you think they are, rather they are used by the companies/governments as a way to find better policy or practices. Not to predict prices. What you are trying to have economics do is simply not what its intended to do. Basically, economics in government and companies is often used to troubleshoot bugs that you couldn&amp;#39;t find otherwise. Like a price-point that isn&amp;#39;t optimal in respect to your customer base, supply chain and all that rot...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Economics, without a formal education in it, is complex enough that if you mess up how you understand a few key concepts, you can have a flawed understanding of the entire field. That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s a hard science for the public to understand. That&amp;#39;s why there&amp;#39;s an insidious idea in the public that if it worked right it would be like a crystal ball into the future. That&amp;#39;s why there&amp;#39;s often a flawed understanding of what exactly it is used for and that&amp;#39;s why solving any of those problems is a nightmare. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: I think that much of social construct theory is baseless, as social constructs must ultimately originate from genetic predispositions.","To be clear I'm not disputing the existence of social constructs. What I am disputing is the phenomenon of dismissing a common belief or behavior as ""just a social construct"", as if social constructs are totally arbitrary and have no deeper significance. My position is that these constructs must necessarily have arisen out of natural factors, and that those natural factors are still around today.  My reasoning for this is that social influence could not always have been in play; hundreds of thousands of years ago there was no such thing as language and thus ""social constructs"" could not exist. My idea is that once language developed, the first and most enduring social constructs grew out of instinctual behavior.   Further (though my knowledge of genetics is admittedly limited) I believe the scientific consensus is that genetics (nature) tend to have more bearing on individual behavior than social context or upbringing (nurture). If this is true, a given ""social construct"" could only attain widespread prevalence if it appealed to something inherent in the physical makeup of a large group of humans.  And for the record - by no means am I implying that just because a behavior is ""natural"" it is acceptable. What I am stating is that many so-called social constructs are too deeply rooted in the human psyche to be easily altered or removed.  Change my view. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The notion of a social construct addresses ideas, whereas I&amp;#39;m pretty sure in comparing it to biology you are thinking of it in terms of behaviors? They&amp;#39;re not really the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example when people talk about &amp;quot;The South&amp;quot; they tend to forget about how there are like, a lot of african americans. The South is thought about as an &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUFL2GT1-2g""&gt;exclusively white place&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama#Race_and_ancestry""&gt;which doesn&amp;#39;t reflect the reality of the situation&lt;/a&gt;. But it affects the way people behave toward it and think about it, and that&amp;#39;s called a social construct. So even if biology conditions behavior to some extent we can still recognize the way ideas are created and question our assumptions and change the way we behave toward those ideas. You&amp;#39;re pretty much granting that at least that much free will is possible by posting in change my view so I&amp;#39;m taking it as a given.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s not really any one &amp;quot;Social construct theory&amp;quot; so let&amp;#39;s talk about something more specific, like &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_(book""&gt;Edward Said&amp;#39;s Orientalism&lt;/a&gt;). The gist of it is that other cultures are often oversimplified when represented in the west, and especially as static through time and unsophisticated, with the implicit point that western culture is dynamic and vital. This sort of representation happens even in art, where oriental themes are presented as aesthetically superior but fail to fully engage with the complexity and history of the culture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So like, as for contemporary examples maybe think of western otaku--or I guess I got the sense they all died out in 2008 but you know what I mean--who think of Japan in terms of the oversimplified picture they get from manga and anime. Or to address the common stereotype that Japan is a country tolerant of bizarre sexual fetishes; remember the panty vending machine thing? &lt;a href=""http://www.snopes.com/risque/kinky/panties.asp""&gt;As it turns out that was a workaround to a law that &lt;em&gt;banned&lt;/em&gt; pornographic vending machines, which itself wasn&amp;#39;t so odd given the popularity of vending machines in Japan&lt;/a&gt;. And yeah, the panty vending machines were banned too. As it turns out the Japanese aren&amp;#39;t like, homogeneously creepy. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t to say cultural differences aren&amp;#39;t real; that would be silly. Only that the way culture is represented--even well meaningly!--is reductive in a way that often smothers critical thought and inflates the egos of the people that made the representation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, all of that is just to say that the idea of a social construct isn&amp;#39;t bullshit when you know what people mean by the phrase. As for its applicability, let&amp;#39;s look at what I&amp;#39;m pretty sure you really mean, or one thing I&amp;#39;m pretty sure you really mean: biologically essential sex differences. Now whether or not those exist at all and to what extent is too big a topic to get into here. But there are enough bad ideas from history that are obviously silly and follow the patterns of a social construct as detailed above that the idea of social constructs explaining many perceived sex differences holds together pretty well. And that should encourage us to be pretty suspicious of our own ideas about gender and sex. After all, everyone else who came before us thought they had gotten it right too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyhow, here&amp;#39;s a short-ish list of some of the most relevant ones: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*&lt;a href=""http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Division_of_labor.aspx""&gt;Sexual division of labor is intrinsic, and women belong in the home when it has been pointed out time and again that this is mostly a product of the industrial revolution.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*&lt;a href=""http://witcombe.sbc.edu/davincicode/witches.html""&gt;That women are more likely to make pacts with Satan because they have a voracious sexual appetite.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*&lt;a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/06/turns-out-women-have-really-really-strong-sex-drives-can-men-handle-it/276598/""&gt;That women want sex less than men (but wait didn&amp;#39;t they just say the opposite? And wait, don&amp;#39;t we still believe that?)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*&lt;a href=""http://people.uncw.edu/smithrw/200/WomenQuotes.htm""&gt;That women have big asses because god made them for sitting.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*&lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle&amp;#x27;s_views_on_women""&gt;Basically everything this asshole had to say about it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You get the point. Now a lot of people would probably object that these are verifiably false and we know better now--but really we&amp;#39;re agreeing here. These conclusions came from reasoning that was &lt;em&gt;considered&lt;/em&gt; just as valid as science, and so we can&amp;#39;t take our assumptions at face value. Which is doubly true when you consider how the scientific method has been blind to prejudice, cf &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology""&gt;phrenology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politicization_of_science""&gt;this overview here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Again, none of that is to say there are &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; sex differences; that&amp;#39;s an unsettled question. But biases arise in ways you wouldn&amp;#39;t expect, and common claims should be examined critically.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And as for the nature vs. nurture debate, if you think it&amp;#39;s any closer to being settled than it was in the 18th century I think you should read up on the emerging field of &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetic""&gt;Epigenetics&lt;/a&gt;--as it turns out Lamarck wasn&amp;#39;t 100% wrong!--and the &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect""&gt;Flynn Effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hope that helped!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;My reasoning for this is that social influence could not always have been in play; hundreds of thousands of years ago there was no such thing as language and thus &amp;quot;social constructs&amp;quot; could not exist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not all communication is verbal. Animals that do not possess language have social constructs that are &lt;a href=""http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0020106""&gt;subject to change&lt;/a&gt;. While these social constructs certainly have natural factors, I do not believe you can assume language creates social constructs. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe the scientific consensus is that genetics (nature) tend to have more bearing on individual behavior than social context or upbringing (nurture). If this is true, a given &amp;quot;social construct&amp;quot; could only attain widespread prevalence if it appealed to something inherent in the physical makeup of a large group of humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the sake of argument, I will accept the first statement as factual, and attempt to demonstrate how it does not prove the second the statement. If cultural constructs were largely pre-determined by genetics, it does not explain both the diversity of cultures, or how cultures mix and influence each other. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Looking at isolated cultures, we see some radically different social norms: e.g. what is beautiful or obscene, polyandry and polygamy rather than monogamous relationships, matriarchies or egalitarian societies, concepts of ownership and value, and religious beliefs. As these cultures often change upon extended exposure to other cultures, we cannot assume that these people are &lt;em&gt;genetically&lt;/em&gt; predisposed to different social constructs, rather that their social constructs were created parallel to we believe to be the norm. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Europe has many countries that have very distinct cultures despite a great deal of cultural interactions, similar genetics, and similar resources and climates. If culture were largely genetically predetermined, these cultures would be far more homogenous. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Additionally, looking at first generation immigrants versus their parents demonstrates a large difference in how similar genetics can operate very differently in different social constructs. If behavior and values are largely genetically predetermined, then we would see the children of those raised in a different culture holding onto the same social constructs as their parents, while they are far more likely to assimilate and reflect the values of the culture they were raised in.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As social creatures, part of the human psyche is to express belonging through different social constructs, whether that behavior is oppositional or participatory. While this is a natural urge, it produces cultural constructs that are meant to differentiate rather perfectly reflect natural factors. The origin of social constructs can be said to lie in biology, but their expression requires diversity rather than perfect alignment with hard-wired genetics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: deaf people should not be allowed to drive,"This issue arose in [my previous deafness CMV](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2hhrfe/cmv_deaf_culture_is_stupid_and_dangerous/cksv3vt?context=3), which failed to change my views.  It should be a simple train of logical thought. People are not allowed to wear earplugs or headphones while driving. The justification for this is that hearing is a fundamental sense necessary to drive. Deaf people, by definition, cannot hear. Deaf people, lacking a fundamental sense necessary to drive, should not be allowed to drive.  Some more specific risks that deaf drivers pose ([source](http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/driving_and_the_deaf.htm)):  * Talking with their hands, when they should be on the wheel. * Trying to lip read a passenger while driving. * Not being able to hear emergency vehicles coming. * Not being able to call for help if their car breaks down. * Not being able to talk to an officer if they are pulled over. * Not being able to hear warnings their car is giving them.  The sole argument I have seen presented against this is that deaf people are accustomed to not hearing and are better at vision. But people who become deaf later in life *are* used to hearing, so at the very least they should not be allowed to drive. And this same logic could be applied to say that blind people should be allowed to drive, or that ""I always wear headphones while driving"" should be a valid excuse.  Edit: at the advice of a commenter, a [study](https://apps.dmv.ca.gov/about/profile/rd/r_d_report/Section%206-Summaries.pdf) by the California DMV found that deaf male drivers have twice the accident rate of hearing male drivers. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The question is, is the risk big enough to justify banning people from driving? Is the cost of banning them outweighed by the benefit? It is obvious the cost of banning them.

"I believe that authoritarianism is preferable to democracy, CMV","There are a few key points that my opinion is based on:   * I don't trust other people enough to vote for the future; as far as I'm concerned the vast majority are somewhat-educated Luddites who really don't care what happens as long as their head is on their neck and their pockets have some loose change (I know I'm the same). An authoritarian ruler is not concerned with such troubles, only in the running of their country/life's pleasures.  * A King/Queen is far more efficient than voting once in a while. You don't need to wait four years to get another shitty party in power, but just hold a few demonstrations/public campaigns to raise awareness of issues for your monarch to act on as they see fit, at any time, from the next day to perhaps years later.  * The illusion of actually having any power will be gone, for really, it *is* an illusion. Your government doesn't actually care about individuals, their opinions, or their troubles. All they care about is votes. Once they have them, they will do whatever they wish, namely, keeping themselves in power. If you have an authoritarian ruler who has no competition, the will seek only to improve their own legacy and country. I'm talking about a monarch here, not dictator; someone who has been raised by leaders, to lead.  Edit: Sorry guys but I think that's it for the night. I've got tonnes to do and sleep to catch up on.

Semantic drift has become a propaganda tool for social engineering shills with a regressive agenda CMV,"This topic of descriptive linguistics seems to only pop up in specific circumstances to make a point like ""if enough people misapply a word, they're actually correct,"" in more fragrant, sophisticated, academic wording, even if the last thing to have come out of the speaker was ""OP is a faggot lol.""  However, the linguistic expertise is nowhere to be found when someone calls out that any insult is not automatically an ad hominem, is silent in the face of the ubiquitous ""you're*"" correction, and holds back against dissonant prescriptions of literalism for the word atheism. The selectivity for which fights to pick is quite convenient.  I understand semantic drift is a real thing, but something about the popular evocation of the topic strikes me as something like lying by omission. It seems that novel meanings keep some kind of connection to the word's etymology. An example would be the difference of meaning of ""authority"" as dictator or expert is how the root (auctōritās: warrant) is interpreted. The word ""nice"" shows something more like a gradient, like a game of ""telephone"" over time. ""Mouse"" to mean a particular computer interface device is arrived by metaphor, the wire and arched shape are analogs to a tail and hunched back of a stereotypical rodent. These circumstances do not imply that a new meaning for a word can be born from mass incompetence, regardless it be a result from disseminated misinformation, popular myth, etc.  There is no relevant ambiguity, neighboring nuance, or analog for ""scorn"" anywhere in the etymology for the word ""gay."" The metaphor is made from a projected subjective version of the word as contained in the mind of petulant bigots. But this is the thing so important that supposed linguists suddenly crawl out of a hole and rally to validate, as if shift by metaphor obsoletes the vehicle word's meaning from the time the metaphor was made (like if ""mouse"" were exclusively used for the electronic device) and/or destroys the presence of a metaphor (like saying since mice is an accepted label for electronics, it has somehow shed the metaphor that earned it that label.)  I've had acquaintances in life say in full seriousness, in response to a resentment of social engineering for systemic (and perhaps subconscious) prejudice written into parlance, that I'm thin skinned since *intentions* while communicating matter more than the *selection* of word and the circumstances surrounding that *symbol used in a system of communication*. Basically a pleasant way to excuse oneself from second guessing their ""education"" and extending any empathy. I guess I can't blame them, since egotist philosophy, faulty heuristics and articulate sophistry are the new meaning of ""logic.""  I don't believe sweeping ignorance and bigotry under a rug should be a function of language. Explain to me why it should.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no relevant ambiguity, neighboring nuance, or analog for &amp;quot;scorn&amp;quot; anywhere in the etymology for the word &amp;quot;gay.&amp;quot; The metaphor is made from a projected subjective version of the word as contained in the mind of petulant bigots. But this is the thing so important that supposed linguists suddenly crawl out of a hole and rally to validate, as if shift by metaphor obsoletes the vehicle word&amp;#39;s meaning from the time the metaphor was made (like if &amp;quot;mouse&amp;quot; were exclusively used for the electronic device) and/or destroys the presence of a metaphor (like saying since mice is an accepted label for electronics, it has somehow shed the metaphor that earned it that label.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve used this example before:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Digital once referred to piano.  Digital meant &amp;quot;relating to fingers.&amp;quot;  Digits, as in numbers, came about because we had 10 fingers, 10 digits, 0-9.  Digital as in electronic became common usage because digits, 0s and 1s, made up all digital information.  Ergo, my digital clock shows numbers using an electronic system.  My clock and my grand piano have nothing in common, nor in fact do my digital clock and my left digits have anything in common.  Yet, there is a distinct and when analyzed, obvious, chain of connections that shows how one word&amp;#39;s meaning transferred through time to be used in a totally new way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While yes, &amp;#39;gay&amp;#39; as in &amp;#39;dumb&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;aggravating&amp;#39;, or a scornful way of showing dislike or protest was born of homophobic origins, today, gay as in scornful has little in common with gay as in homosexual.  Certainly, some people will feel offended by the use of the word gay in a derogatory context toward anything, and that&amp;#39;s understandable, as it has been used as a form of prejudicial speech.  However, it is not always meant to hurt gay people, as a group, and that should be realized.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had acquaintances in life say in full seriousness, in response to a resentment of social engineering for systemic (and perhaps subconscious) prejudice written into parlance, that I&amp;#39;m thin skinned since intentions while communicating matter more than the selection of word and the circumstances surrounding that symbol used in a system of communication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Go to rural china and shout faggot.  Do it over and over and over and over again.  Yell it, scream it, hurl it insultingly so that all can hear.  What will result?  Most likely, nothing.  People in china don&amp;#39;t ascribe the same prejudices to the word &amp;#39;faggot&amp;#39; that you do.  Despite your obvious intent to cause pain and emotionally hurt, you fail because of awful word choice.  Now sure, part of that is your fault, but now lets change the analogy a bit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Imagine you and a friend are talking, intending to offend as many people as you can.  Screaming and yelling &amp;#39;faggot&amp;#39; so all can hear.  You two can understand each other just fine, you get it, you want to offend people.  Then all of a sudden, all of the people who were around you, who you were successfully offending, they disappear and are replaced, in an instant, with rural chinese.  These people cannot understand a word you say.  They may laugh and stare at your antics, but they don&amp;#39;t understand a word you say.  That&amp;#39;s neither your fault nor theirs, is it?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now once more, same situation, except that these rural chinese folk look exactly like everyone else, act exactly like everyone else, and you can&amp;#39;t tell the difference between a rural chinese person and some other random stranger without specifically asking them.  That makes it really, really goddamn hard to effectively offend people, right.  For all you know everyone around you is a rural chinese person totally unaffected by your antics.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And now we bring the analogy back to reality, by flipping it on its head:  you and your friend are talking, &lt;del&gt;intending to offend&lt;/del&gt; not intending to offend anyone, and by and large, most people will &lt;del&gt;be offended&lt;/del&gt; not be offended by your actions.  However, its also possible that a &lt;del&gt;rural Chinese person&lt;/del&gt; gay person (or SJW, or generally any other person offended by the use of gay as a pejorative towards random objects or situations) who looks and acts just like everyone else will appear and totally misunderstand what you are doing  and therefore &lt;del&gt;not&lt;/del&gt; be offended.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Are they to blame for that?  Hell no.  Are you?  Not really, its just that you are using words that each of you have different subjective meanings ascribed to.  That&amp;#39;s fine, it provides breadth and life to language.  What it also does, though, is mean that people will be offended as long as we don&amp;#39;t have an orwellian, newspeak style language in common usage, and I for one think that&amp;#39;s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem I see with your argument is that you assume any scenario of reassigning meaning to a word inherently references its original meaning or intent.  But under that logic, you leave no room for social evolution and the gradual rejection of outdated ideas- which is the very opposite of what you titled a &amp;quot;regressive agenda.&amp;quot;  Delegitimizing and even making ridiculous terms that were traditionally used to hurt people is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing, and ought to be encouraged.  I&amp;#39;ve addressed this elsewhere, here&amp;#39;s part of another comment I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stupid&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;idiot&amp;quot; were once offensive, but they&amp;#39;re not anymore since they&amp;#39;ve become all but detached from their original meanings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It seems to me the reason those words fell away from their original meanings is precisely because they were &amp;#39;allowed&amp;#39; to be used in everyday ways when speaking to other people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If there had been successful campaigns to end the usage of those words, instead of becoming inert, they would have retained the power to offend and hurt people. But instead, as society became more conscience of the negative effect those terms had on the people they had originally applied to, new clinical terms were adopted, and the offensive ones became unoffensive. For instance, there is no widely used insult that specifically references someone who is incapable of speech. And it is self-evident that no one means &amp;#39;one who cannot talk&amp;#39; when they call someone dumb.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From what I have seen, that seems to be the inevitable cycle of offensive terms or concepts. Here are the rough steps of what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There exists in society an ill-informed, insensitive, or discriminatory practice or attitude toward a specific group. (Racism, sexism, homophobia, treatment of mentally handicapped, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are derogatory terms assigned to the group of people in question. (Nigger, bitch, queer, dumb/idiot)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, society evolves to recognize the error (to put it lightly) of the practices or attitudes towards a group. The practices and attitudes gradually fade out as social awareness increases, but the terms remain as a reminder, and actually take on more offensive connotations, since the history they reference is now known to be repugnant and immoral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually the terms themselves become unoffensive, as their continued use becomes increasingly less relevant to their original meanings. This process usually starts within the group the terms originally referred to. They take ownership of the terms and alter the meaning for their own ends. For instance, the term &amp;#39;queer&amp;#39; has lost almost all negative connotation, and is often used within the homosexual society as a reference to fellow members. This process is also happening with some subcultures of women and the term &amp;#39;bitch,&amp;#39; and in black culture with the term nigger/nigga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is what I see happening with &amp;#39;retarded.&amp;#39; I would argue that most people don&amp;#39;t envision or reference a mentally handicapped person when they jokingly call someone retarded. South Park has a great episode that makes the same point about the word &amp;#39;faggot.&amp;#39; Unless you&amp;#39;re in the deep south (apologies for the generalization) chances are if someone calls you a faggot, they&amp;#39;re not making fun of you for being homosexual.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Does this mean that I shouldn&amp;#39;t have a filter and say potentially offensive words like these with wild abandon? Of course not. But I absolutely think I ought to be able to use those terms in the right context, around people that know my intent behind them. In fact, I believe that using those terms in a way not relevant to their original meaning is a positive thing, since it helps encourage the process I outlined above.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited for formatting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
I think the risk of being raped by random strangers is ridiculously low to the point that I don't understand why anyone would be paranoid about it if they bothered to use any common sense. CMV,"Anyway, I've never been afraid that I might get raped.  Why should I be scared to walk alone at night, as if reality is modeled after teen horror flicks or the 5-o-clock news?    Frankly, it seems like getting mugged is orders of magnitude more likely to happen.  And the risk of that seems ridiculously low compared to getting in a traffic accident.  To the point that it probably a lot safer safer to walk alone at night than to be driving around when there are a high percentage of drunk drivers on the street.  If you go to a bar in a bad part of town where there are tons of drunk men looking for one-night stands, and then you decide to wander drunk in the alleyways of those neighborhoods, or go home with some random guy and expect him to not want to sleep with you, well it's just hard for me to feel like you're a total victim of circumstance or agree with the notion that guys everywhere are out to rape you.    I'm not one of those who blames the victim, but if you wander around neighborhoods full of liquor stores, adult stores, and pay-by-the-hour motels drunk and/or dressed up like a hooker, well it's no wonder why you're paranoid about getting raped because you're putting yourself in high-risk situations.  Anyway, I don't want to be an ass and act like rape doesn't happen, I'm just having a really hard time believing this statistic that 20% of women are raped, when I have yet to have met a single woman who has been raped by a random stranger.  I'd frankly be surprised if even 0.1% of rapes are from random strangers.  I think this is the same kind of paranoia parents have of their kids walking home from school, as if there's a pedophile in a van lurking around every corner just waiting to abduct their children.  I just don't see good justification for why a woman can't walk around alone at night without necessitating paranoia.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a story that contradicts your premise.  It is anecdotal but true as it happened to me. I was 19 and working in a bar that served 3.2% alcohol to 18-21 year olds in Kansas (many years ago). After arriving home from work around 1:00 am and getting ready to enter my apartment I was grabbed from behind, dragged to a car, driven away and raped. While being over powered the man was not excessively violent and I asked him why he picked me assuming he followed me home from the bar. He said he saw me on the freeway, liked what he saw and decided to follow me. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So here it is random stranger rape. The only dangerous things I did was to drive in my car late at night and walk from my parking place to my front door in a nice suburban area.  While this was over 20 years ago I am still always hypersensitive to people and cars around me when I am alone, especially at night. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. the percentage of rape outdoors is ~3.6% (&lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics#United_States""&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_statistics#United_States&lt;/a&gt; taken from &lt;a href=""http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Similarities_And_Differences_In_Women_s_Sexual_Assault_Experiences_Based_On_Tactics.pdf""&gt;http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Similarities_And_Differences_In_Women_s_Sexual_Assault_Experiences_Based_On_Tactics.pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But, the Bureau of Justice reports that 29% of rapes occurred while traveling to or from work, school, other place/shopping or errands/leisure activity away from home.  That seems rather significant (&lt;a href=""http://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvsv9410.pdf""&gt;http://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvsv9410.pdf&lt;/a&gt; at 4).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d frankly be surprised if even 0.1% of rapes are from random strangers...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just having a really hard time believing this statistic that 20% of women are raped, when I have yet to have met a single woman who has been raped by a random stranger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the extreme trauma and stigmatization that rape survivors face, is it really that surprising that a woman might not ever bring this up?  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 38% of victims were raped by a friend or acquaintance, 28% by &amp;quot;an intimate&amp;quot; and 7% by another relative, and 26% were committed by a stranger to the victim (&lt;em&gt;Id&lt;/em&gt;. at 4-5).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit: Added BOJ info.

"CMV: Popular US/English pronunciations of foreign words, names, and phrases betray ignorance of the speaker as to the origin and meaning of those words.","Some cases in point:  - The US/English pronunciation of the name Rothschild as ""Roth's child"" suggests that the speaker believes the meaning of the name is something like ""child of Roth"". The speaker is showing ignorance of that the ""sh"" sound is spelled ""sch"" in Germanic languages, and that the structure of the name is ""Roth-schild"", meaning ""red shield"". Its proper pronunciation is along the lines of ""roth-shild"".  - US/English pronunciations of Latin phrases show the speaker's complete ignorance of how sounds are formed in romance languages. I can excuse the inability to pronounce the alveolar trill (rolled R), because it's not easily learned. But this doesn't excuse pronouncing ""a fortiori"" as ""ey for-tay-OR-ey"", when an authentic pronunciation would be ""ah for-tih-OR-ee"". It doesn't excuse pronouncing ""ex ante"" as ""ex AN-tee"" instead of ""ex AN-teh"", ""corpus delicti"" as ""KOR-pus dee-LIK-tay"" instead of ""KOR-pus deh-LIK-tee"", and so on.  Hearing US/English speakers pronounce things like that conveys the impression that they want to appear learned, but have done little learning; that their knowledge is superficial, rather than deep. It makes me suspicious of how much they *really* know, and inclined to interpret what they're saying with skepticism. Why would you believe someone who can't get ""red shield"" right? It sounds cringe-worthy.  CMV.  -----  **Edit 1:** I think conversations are larger than their participants, so I don't consider myself particularly important, but since this subreddit does care about changed views, I ought to note:  - I received insight from [vl99's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2a9dnv/cmv_popular_usenglish_pronunciations_of_foreign/cisrycq), and responded with a delta with respect to how growing up in a culture will make a person perceive a bastardized pronunciation as normal, so therefore it does not necessarily reflect on the person's knowledge;  - I continue to find that the way schools in English speaking countries fail to teach Latin pronunciation, and encourage students to pronounce Latin words with English rules, results in a derivative that's neither English nor Latin, is incompatible with Latin learned by people in other cultures, and can be considered acceptable only if one believes that English-speaking culture is the self-evident center of, and measure of the world.  I must now depart to take care of things, and I hope everyone continues to have a meaningful discussion.  -----  **Edit 2:** A delta on the Latin pronunciation portion of my view goes to [learhpa](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2a9dnv/cmv_popular_usenglish_pronunciations_of_foreign/cit209o).","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a native English speaker is pronouncing foreign words in the presence of other native English speakers, in the context of a sentence that is primarily made up of other English words (ex, &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;ll rendezvous at the steakhouse in a few hours&amp;quot;) it comes of as hoity-toity and somewhat affected to attempt an authentic pronunciation of the word. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You expect the person listening to you will find your accent more ridiculous when attempting an authentic pronunciation (as they&amp;#39;ve most likely heard it the bastardized way their entire lives too) than if you pronounced it the way it&amp;#39;s commonly known. They&amp;#39;re probably well aware that there&amp;#39;s a more correct way to pronounce it, but would expect to hear it from someone that actually speaks the language the word is derived from. Otherwise it comes off to them as their conversation partner trying to flex their worldliness and education around them which is poor form.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This probably comes off completely differently to non native English speakers but it&amp;#39;s hard to help that unless they know where all their conversation partners are from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes a word &amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot; and not English?

"CMV: I believe anyone who uses ""x privilege"" in a discussion is a horrible person and a parasite on society.","Be it white privilege, male privilege, or he new one someone posted to facebook earlier: female privilege. Fuck everyone who thinks they're making a point with it. There is no logic in it - it's used to demean the subject, insult intelligence, and attempt to guilt the 'offending' party. It's myopic, callous, and condescending.  No one should feel guilty for being themselves. Ever. If who you are comes with the 'privilege' of being part of the majority, well that's life. I shouldn't have to explain that the majority of people are in a majority, that seems redundant - but these 'arguments' are always phrased as if that isn't the case. If who you are comes with the 'privilege' of being a minority, that's also life.   The arguments assume that the subject is incapable of empathy, and is actively attempting to hold to these 'privileges' and keep them away from everyone else. That's simply not the case. Yes, white men can walk safely down the streets in the suburbs, black men don't need to lock their doors when they roll through the ghetto, women aren't seen as creepy when they ask someone out - *good*, why is this a bad thing? In an ideal world, everyone would feel safe walking or driving in any part of town at any time, and no one would be treated as a creeper for expressing interest in another, and so forth. This isn't an ideal world - that may suck when situations where we don't have such 'privilege' are encountered, but that's life.   Worse, these arguments require, by necessity, the outlook of a societal parasite. Rather than working to change things or make their own situation better, these people want to shame others for what they themselves don't have. As if screeching shrilly at someone that they should feel bad for being who they are, is somehow a morally superior stance.  **edit:** View changed. I still believe there is a large group of people who misuse the term, and those people are horrible, but I understand now where it can be used in a legitimate setting and not to 'take down a peg' as one person put it.   **edit 2:** There were a lot of really good arguments.

And when I go in to work and look around at my female coworker, my gay coworker, and my black coworker, its important that I acknowledge that many basic aspects of my life that I take for granted are not shared by them often (but not always)  in ways that make things harder for them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re not supposed to feel guilty, you&amp;#39;re just supposed to acknowledge and understand how it affects you and others around you.

I&amp;#39;m found &amp;quot;privilege&amp;quot; in a social justice context to mean the same thing as &amp;quot;ignorance&amp;quot;. A big part of intersectionality is accepting the fact that there are walks of life we can&amp;#39;t understand; as a white man, I cannot understand some of the struggles a black person might face.

When I am told to check my privilege, I understand that means I&amp;#39;m ignorant to an aspect of the minority experience, and I should make an effort to avoid this in the future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are aspects of being part of a group that&amp;#39;s in power beyond just &amp;quot;being in a majority&amp;quot;. Women, I believe, are actually a narrow majority in America right now, and they still have an appalling lack of institutional power, to say nothing of the numerous double standards and shaming tactics we use on them every day. By acknowledging that as a man I am in a privileged position, and perhaps acting to rectify that, I am doing my small part to challenge an existing status quo. By ignoring or denying my privilege, I allow this monopoly to continue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the basis of privilege. It has nothing to do with shame; more often its used to counter shaming tactics. It just requires the listener be able to subtract ego from the situation and look at it objectively. As a white straight male, I was born with many arbitrary advantages. By acknowledging my privilege, I&amp;#39;m acknowledging that that&amp;#39;s fucked up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I think SRS is filled with closed-minded people who do not really want to engage in a dialogue with anyone but themselves. CMV.,"I joined SRS because I saw that there was a good deal of racist and sexist comments on reddit and thought that was a forum to discuss said comments in an intelligent and rational manner. Also, as a man, I wanted to educate myself more about feminism by engaging with active and vehement feminists. My very first comment got me banned.  The thread was ""Overly attached Reddit: ""Honestly, if she was overly attached to me I would not mind. Dat body."" [+250].""  I replied to the thread with, ""I don't know if this one is necessarily sexist because a woman could say this about a man. Granted it is in bad taste and reveals how shallow and immature the person commenting is, but is not on par with the other horrible racist/sexist things we constantly see on reddit. Shallow people of any gender can have a judgmental/obsessive attitude about the virtues and desirability of physical beauty.""  I thought that maybe someone on the subreddit would explain to me why this comment was sexist or offensive to women, but instead I was banned. It seems like SRS is intolerant of any viewpoints that deviate even slightly from their own and simply want to shut out or demonize all voices that do not agree with/understand their worldview. This makes SRS just as irrational and devoid of empathy as the groups they constantly rail against. If you can't place yourself in the shoes of someone who doesn't automatically accept your worldview, then you lack empathy. If you then don't even care to engage in a dialogue with this person to show them the error of their ways, you lack rationality and compassion.  As a progressive, I would really like to have my mind changed on this as this has been a rude awakening for me when it comes to feminists.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You were banned because you broke the rules of the subreddit.

CMV: Minority Groups Are Justified in Believing That African Americans Should Just Work Harder,"So I feel pretty bad for posting this, because I know I'll be called out as a bigot. That's why I'm hoping some of you can CMV.  However, every time I look at an argument for why African Americans don't do as well as their white counterparts, it comes down to disadvantage. They tend to live in poorer areas and go to poorer schools, and may also face workplace discrimination.  If that's the case, then why is it that Asian and Indian Americans, many of whom are first or second generation immigrants who come in with nothing more than the clothes off their backs (arguably even MORE at a disadvantage than their African American counterparts, who at least are already established in the USA), can grow up to be just as successful as their white counterparts? It's practically a stereotype that Asian and Indian children are going to grow up too be doctors or engineers! So how exactly is it that *they*, who face many of the same challenges as blacks, can grow up to be comfortably successful and well-respected in just one or two generations? The only answer I can think of is their hard work ethic...which, let's be honest, is just another way of saying ""blacks are lazy"".  I'll sum up how I feel with a quote from a user on another thread. Please don't go witch-hunting, he is in no way related to this post.  &gt;Let me give you a little background. I'm in my early 30s, I'm a second generation immigrant. I'm not white. I went to majority black schools. My grandfather was an illiterate farmer, my father worked manual labor, I'm a physician. This general pattern is &gt;true for my entire extended family, and perhaps 90% of the people of my diaspora I know.  &gt;I know there is tremendous racism and inequality, I've felt it too. I live with it as well, from both blacks and whites. Let me tell you something, I'd rather deal with white racism than black racism. White racism means I get a few funny looks walking my dog. Black racism stabs my kid for his sneakers (that's a true story, I watched that happen in high school). Black racism means that when I was in university the black woman at the desk denied me access to the ""minority study center"" and angrily told me that I was the wrong type of minority. I'd rather deal with the funny looks.  &gt;I grew up around black people, I know most of them are perfectly normal hardworking decent people. I've got a few black friends from medical school who are some of the most brilliant absolutely lovely people I've ever met. There is a problem though, the black middle class blurs very quickly with the black lower class. The black lower classes are the most fucked up unpredictable dangerous people I've ever had the misfortune of being around. I've lived around this, I know the score. I've personally seen people beaten and stabbed. My literal next door neighbor was running a dog fighting / gun-market operation. It was a comical level of stereotypical criminality. It was also fucking terrifying.  &gt;I packed my shit up. I live in a state with less than 5% black population. I live in an incredibly white area, I see perhaps one black family a year.  &gt;All your points are completely accurate, but you're missing the reason. Anyone who can avoid living around black people does it, including other black people. I don't want to be a victim of crime and I don't want my property value to go down the toilet.  &gt;My group started with a far lower standard of living and has faced the same racism. Through work and education over a couple of generations we're at the point where we have been able to elevate ourselves beyond those circumstances. I might get funny looks in my neighborhood, but I don't bring down the property values. Indians, Chinese, Russians, Polish, Vietnamese, Nigerians, Taiwanese, any other immigrant group can improve their lot within a few generations, while living in those same horrible neighborhoods. Why can't blacks? Why do we have to do it for them? Nobody did it for us. They need to fix their own situation and get to a point where people don't mind living around them.  Please CMV, I feel uncomfortable holding such a view (and in case it wasn't obvious enough already, yes I am an Asian-American).   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Both were slaves here at one point, and both were heavily discriminated against throughout US history.&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alright I&amp;#39;ll give this a shot. I&amp;#39;m an Asian American, family coming here over 30 years ago as poor refugees after a civil war. I&amp;#39;ve interned and worked at various Asian American organizations in America and studied Asian American Studies in college.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, you are right in that you&amp;#39;re making a broad generalization. Not all APIAs are in the situation you speak of. Same with Black Americans. In fact, the broad generalization of Asians being rich and smart is called the &amp;quot;Asian American Model Minority Myth&amp;quot;. The stereotype paints a picture of smart, educated, assimilated, and rich Asians in America that have &amp;quot;made it&amp;quot; and suggests the Asian race doesn&amp;#39;t need a hand out or help. It also suggests the question &amp;quot;if Asians can do it, why can&amp;#39;t Latinos/Blacks/Natives/West Virginians/Purple people do it too?&amp;quot; This is a problem in that it&amp;#39;s suggesting a few things. 1: Asians are inherently smart and that it&amp;#39;s tied to race. 2: Overlooks the Asian Americans that struggle, especially groups that are refugees (Vietnamese, Cambodians, Lao, Hmong, Karen, etc.) 3: Suggests that other races aren&amp;#39;t up to par as this &amp;quot;model minority&amp;quot; group.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Secondly, understand that the APIA racial category in America is vastly diverse. This is an important factor. You have very rich, highly education APIAs, and also very poor ones that are on welfare. You have Indians, Chinese, Koreans, Tibetans, Polynesians, Samoans, Thais, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Third, because of that diversity, you have different socio-economic levels within the racial category. And the reasons behind this, which you are asking, is vast. Some reasons are:  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socio-economic mobility in America is tied to the family or individual&amp;#39;s socio-economic status in the old country. For example, many military officials, government officials, politicians, etc. from the former S. Vietnam fled here from their country to escape persecution. These are families that were exposed to many things that would help any family in upward mobility, namely, some English skills, standardized education (some even had P.hDs from France or the US), and money. Compare that to a super poor, illiterate farm family fleeing the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and you have two vastly different families that will develop differently in the States.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;US immigration policy has always been hard for Asians. The Chinese exclusion act of 188X (on my phone, forgot) was the first (and maybe only?) US law excluding a specific race from immigrating to the US. So for the longest time, until about the 1960s, Asian immigration was capped. This is somewhat important in that this is why the APIA population is small (3.4% of the population).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Asian Americans have been here for a very, very long time and have been able to acquire more and more in each generation. The Japanese are an example of this. They mainly came over 100 years ago. As generations are born in the states, they assimilate and take on more opportunities. During WWII, Japanese American men comprised of several military units that fought valiantly in Europe. They then came back, went to school, and became successful. Daniel Inouye is a good example of this. There are dozens of Japanese American politicians who are 3-4th generation. They&amp;#39;re success lies in the fact that their families have been established in America for generations. Vice versa may apply. If your family is poor, there a chance your kids will be poor, and being poor may continue for generations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As another posted suggested, rich Asians come here and succeed in numbers that rival Asian Americans. My University had a huge ass Korean and Chinese international student population. They made up 50% or so of the &amp;quot;Asian&amp;quot; student population. These guys were filthy fuckin rich. I saw one drive around in a Mercedes SUV that had diplomatic plates. Often, Americans can&amp;#39;t tell them from Asian Americans and assume we&amp;#39;re all the same. There&amp;#39;s other stuff. I&amp;#39;m on my phone and I&amp;#39;m tired of typing. I don&amp;#39;t think I specifically answered your questions, since I&amp;#39;m not knowledgable on African American Studies, but I tried giving my insight.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s another &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2uawz4/til_that_in_the_united_states_asians_earn_the/co6xcp3""&gt;comment that discusses this myth.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something that I didn&amp;#39;t see mentioned in the top comments:  Many Asian immigrants in the past couple decades have either done so on educations scholarships or because they are business owners (or have the know how to do so) / are well-off.  In these cases it may seem like they are coming here with nothing, but, compared to the average population they are much more likely to succeed given their skill set.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the Asian American Model Minority Myth is real.  I once thought like this -  but a girl that I had a relationship with previously had parents that definitely disproved this, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: Before being able to vote, everyone should have to take a test to prove basic reasoning.","I imagine the test would look something like this:  A: What's your opinion on [insert subject]? B: Why?  And then some independent, edjucated people (teachers, lawyers, judges?) will review the answer to question B and see if the arguments are legit and if the person is able to do at least basic reasoning. Of course there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" answer, it's just how the answer is motivated.  Here's an example.  **Person 1, passed**: *I'm pro immigration of refugees because I think we have the duty to help every person we can as a society, no matter of his or her background, and that you should always help the one who's weaker. If you've fled for your life across half the world you must be able to get help, protection and a decent life, not just sent back to your death or an overpopulated camp where there's no life to live.*  **Person 2, failed**: *I'm pro refugee immigration because the refugees need help.*  **Person 3, passed**: *I'm against refugee immigration because I believe that you would help more refugees better if we put the money on aid rather than bringing in a few to the country. I also believe people from two very different cultures and societies won't mix very well in one, because that would cause segregation.*  **Person 4, failed**: *I'm against refugee immigration because the immigrants are bad for society.*  You see my point. When you've passed, you are allowed to vote and that counts for the rest of you life. You never have to re-do the test. If you fail, you can try again how many times you like until you pass.  I think we should have this because I get the feeling that there are so many people who don't know a thing about the society or the world they live in and still, they are granted the huge responsibility of deciding who is going to rule it. I also know a lot of people who are just abusing their right to vote without a thought, like voting for party A rather than B just because A has a prettier candidate and so on. I think this is very bad for democracy and that politics would work better if we just eliminated the narrow-minded, misbegotten nonsense in a fair way. Maybe we could also get rid of the age limit this way, letting ability decide instead.  And hey, we don't just let people drive as soon as they turn 18 (or whatever it is in your country). They need to prove that they can handle a car and follow the rules first. Why would voting be any different?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My initial objection to your view is that I do not know what your test if for. Is it for knowledge or reason? Because none of the examples, including the failing ones, demonstrate a breakdown of reason. &amp;quot;I want to help refugees because they need help&amp;quot; is perfectly logical. So is &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want to help refugees because I hate immigrants&amp;quot;. There is no logical contradiction in those statements.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the objective is to prove knowledge then neither passing example has done a good job of doing so. In both cases the speaker has simply stated a view basically identical to the the &amp;quot;failing&amp;quot; one, but done so with a few more words.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;ve fled for your life across half the world you must be able to get help, protection and a decent life, not just sent back to your death or an overpopulated camp where there&amp;#39;s no life to live.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This statement is not materially different from &amp;quot;refugees are people who need help therefore I want to help them&amp;quot;. They&amp;#39;ve stated their opinion but backed it up with nothing. How is that a demonstration of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between passing and failing in your examples is &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; sentence. Neither of the passages that &amp;quot;passed&amp;quot; demonstrated critical thinking. They both just had opinions that were one sentence longer. No factual statements, no data, nothing. Just claims that were longer. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem is, if you put me in charge of evaluating who should be able to vote, based on your examples, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; wouldn&amp;#39;t pass. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So are you comfortable with setting up a situation in which it&amp;#39;s possible for you to be denied voting, or is it just for &amp;quot;other people&amp;quot;? The problem with subjective standards is that those who uphold those standards may have in mind a bar set so high that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to clear it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: It is hypocritical to criticize the use of burqas in the Muslim religion while ignoring the inability for women to expose their breasts publicly within most countries.,"I often see criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women. I have read countless online discussions and seen many television debates/newscasts critiquing the role of burqas within the Muslim religion. However, nobody seems to acknowledge that the west does the exact same thing with breasts.  In most places, women must cover up their breast in public, websites consider it nudity and will censor these videos/images, and even if it is legal, it is often frowned down on by the public. We have sexualized breasts and therefore have forbidden them from being exposed publicly, how is this different from preventing women from exposing their faces or legs?  I invite you all to CMV.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wearing something that covers your entire face, including your eyes, deprives you from normal human communication. We rely heavily on non verbal communication, and things like smiles and eye contact are subconsciously very important. You also cannot be recognised whilst wearing a burqa, and in a sense it robs you from your identity. Neighbours, shopkeepers, bus drivers,and other people you might come in contact with in everyday life are incapable of communicating with you in a normal manner. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Being &amp;quot;forced&amp;quot; to cover up your breasts doesn&amp;#39;t do any of this. A pair of tits adds very little to normal communication, I can&amp;#39;t look at someones nipples to see if they&amp;#39;re happy or sad.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small point, but the argument that we have sexualized breasts is misleading. Misleading because it&amp;#39;s fairly widely hypothesized that breast tissue was sexually selected for millennia ago. Humans are the only species with defined breasts outside of actually having an active need to produce milk. Many evolutionary scientists argue that sexual selection in the early stages of human development caused defined breast tissue to become more present in the gene pool. In that sense then, it&amp;#39;s misleading to say &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; sexualized breasts. Who is we? I don&amp;#39;t group myself with early humans, and if by we you mean the west, evolutionary theory disagrees with you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That aside, I think the most important argument is that burkas suppress women in a much more potent way. Nothing about what defines you as a person and as a human being is dependent on being able to publicly expose your breasts. Having your face, eyes, and hair hidden at all times makes you less human. It&amp;#39;s psychologically been proven that part of the reason why we fear bank robbers and the like is because we subconsciously view people as less human if we can&amp;#39;t see their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition, hiding all of your facial expressions and features both hinders your ability to communicate, as well as make you a faceless mass. Making all women wear the same clothing takes away your ability to be an individual like a prison uniform. The only difference is that you can&amp;#39;t even be an individual in expression or even simply by having a different face than someone else.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not even saying I agree that burkas are wrong, but I can easily see why they are different than bare breasts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"CMV: Escalators are meant to be walked up, not ridden.","Standing on a escalator - even if it's to one side so as to let people pass - completely undermines the point of the device.  The point of escalators is to increase the flow of human traffic in congested areas.  I can't tell you how many time's I've gotten off the subway during rush hour and had to wait an extra 2-5 minutes by the escalators because there's such a huge backlog of people waiting to get up them that *can't* because they are:  1. waiting for a spot to free up so they can slip in and stand on the escalator, riding it to the top.  2. trying to slip into a spot to walk up like a sensible person but can't because either the entire escalator is blocked by standers, or is so congested that walkers can only get on one at a time.

I don't believe IQ is important to society's advancement CMV,"I believe emotional stability is the most important aspect of humanity's advancement, something a high IQ has been shown to be in conflict with.   http://psychcentral.com/lib/2010/intelligence-linked-to-bipolar-disorder/  http://www.livescience.com/36259-anxiety-linked-high-iq.html  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_giftedness  It's hard for me to believe that an increase in mental capacity doesn't lead to an increase in the potential for ""crossed wires"" so to speak.   Aside from that, the g factor related to IQ testing seems incomplete, as the general interpretation is limited to to the person's ability to solve abstract visual problems, not construct novel theories from seemingly unrelated information. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see human society as a macro level cohesive entity moving along some kind of flux or wave of time and change. Each part of the organism has different functions, many of the humans are valuable for maintaining cohesive structures and getting the stuff done. There are other proportionally smaller groups of humans that contribute other functions, one such group is the group of people with high IQ&amp;#39;s, whatever that&amp;#39;s supposed to mean. You could also call the visionaries, geniuses, artists, sages, wise men, holy men, what have you. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I must state that all functions of the collective human organism are equally valuable because without one, the whole would simply not be the same collective human organism.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If I had to guess at what the purpose of the high IQ individuals were, they&amp;#39;d sort of be agents of the liminal spaces. My metaphor for this is the cell wall of single celled organisms. The cell wall includes lots of specialized structures that allow certain molecules to pass through to the rest of the cell body and disallow others. This cell wall is necessary for the cell to continue it&amp;#39;s life cycle and regulate the metabolic function so the cell. Certainly a very useful thing. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, if you compare the mass of the cell wall to mass of the rest of the cell, you&amp;#39;d find that there is a whole lot less of the ell wall than any other cell parts. This is as the way it should be, living organisms appear to be very self contained sort of things and it simply is not possible to have most of the living organism in contact with the world. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think with their flexibility of thought and ability to adapt to new situations on the fly, people with high IQ&amp;#39;s are almost certainly on that liminal border between collective humanity and the rest of the universe and this is our biological adaptation to the fact that the universe is constantly changing. The people with high IQ&amp;#39;s can adapt to respond to this change while maintaining homeostasis for the rest. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I suppose if you don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s important then you probably haven&amp;#39;t been out to the limits yet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intelligence is like any other trait, including emotional stability, that not only comes in natural variety and intensity, but that evolves and takes on different characteristics over time. Having a high IQ is not like having high testosterone, but more like having specific &amp;quot;gadgets&amp;quot; in your body (not just the brain, although that&amp;#39;s certainly ground zero for most of them) that perform specific functions. What we call intelligence is therefore the collective effect of those gadgets over time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So if you have the fusiform gyrus gadget, for example, you can distinguish between faces faster, to the point where it becomes second nature. Someone without this gadget (or with it disabled, a condition we call &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia""&gt;prosopagnosia&lt;/a&gt;) can still tell the difference between Marilyn Monroe and Marilyn Manson, but it would take them much longer and therefore score lower on a time-factored IQ test. The same gadget may also make the recognition of words and categories faster, even though the same tasks could be done without it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We see this with computers as well, which is why megahertz and gigahertz have gradually fallen out of favor as the ultimate measures of speed. The clock rate could stay the same, but the computer can get faster if you add things like floating point processors and SIMD pipelines. And, like this analogy implies, the benefits are only seen if the task given to the computer happens to take advantage of them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We know how computers work, so we know why and how to separate gigahertz from MMX. We don&amp;#39;t have the same degree of knowledge about how the brain works, yet, so we&amp;#39;re still dealing with aggregate measurements like the IQ score. In the future, IQ scores may fall out of favor just like clock-speed ratings have with computers. Our clocks run &lt;a href=""http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000314""&gt;between 1-125 Hz&lt;/a&gt;. Not Kilohertz. Not Megahertz. Not Gigahertz. Just Hertz. And the clock speed is more closely correlated with sleep/awake cycles than IQ. But those Asians, man, they must have kick-ass math coprocessors, eh?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You pointed to the link between high IQ and bipolar and anxiety disorders, tragedies of child prodigies and easily many more. Evolutionary theory would step in here and say that nature is trying out new stuff, and it would point out that our senses of morals, self restraint, and our social and community spirit comes from nature playing &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; with the olfactory bulb, slowly trading-off our sense of smell to develop a new gadget called the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) that gives us Theory of Mind and other intuitive skills. We know this because of &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage""&gt;Phineas Gage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible that in the distant past our ancestors exhibited many behavioral disorders while nature experimented to perfect the PFC. It&amp;#39;s difficult to infer the primate equivalent of bipolar disorder from the fossil record, though, but scientists have been studying behavioral disorders in apes and other non-human primates. That research might tell us more about ourselves and how to deal with our problems.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Having a high-IQ can correlate to mental disorders but does not cause, or is caused by mental disorders. The relationship is more like the &amp;quot;moving parts&amp;quot; rule that an engineer understands (&lt;em&gt;Edit:&lt;/em&gt; plus chemistry, there&amp;#39;s a reason SSRIs work, but their natural analogues still come from microgadgets within each cell).

Eventually. What we presently record as a &amp;quot;high IQ&amp;quot; today might, after a thousand generations, end in a stable gadget that acts like a fusiform gyrus applied to complex outcomes. Our distant descendants may have greater emotional stability and vastly more peaceful societies because seeing the difference in outcomes between holding up a liquor store and going back to college may be as intuitive and second-nature as distinguishing between Marilyn Monroe and Marilyn Manson.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"I believe that the NoFap movement is harmful to men's health, as well as their relationships with women. CMV.","The health benefits of masturbation are myriad, [from reducing cancer risks to improving mental health].  The external benefits, including better sexual performance and a healthier attitude towards sex, are also myriad.     I believe that the NoFap movement is destructive in the same way that any abstinence movement is: it enshrines the thing it's banning in such a way as to empower it beyond what's realistic.  I believe that NoFap is no different than waiting for marriage, which is a whole different CMV, in the way it denies human beings their desire to find physical communication with others, explore their own sexualities, and understand the other sex.   I believe that self-denial is dangerous, unhealthy, and unrealistic.  I believe that NoFap is destructive to the way men see women as they are placing desires that would otherwise be explored through pornography in other human beings, thus elevating them to standards that they will never meet, damaging the way men interact with women.   Yes, I understand that the same argument can be flipped by saying that pornography reduces women to dangerous archetypes, too, but I don't buy that argument: Vin Diesel is always a bad ass every time I see him on a screen, but I don't really think he could fuck anyone up, because I can differentiate between performance and reality.      And finally, I believe that NoFap is an excuse for insecure men to blame their own sexual desires and personal inadequacies for the fact that they can't speak to women.  I believe that it's creating a fake solution for a real problem, and creates much worse problems as a result.   **TL;DR: The NoFap movement is destructive and counterproductive to a man trying to be confident and trying to have healthy relationships with women.  CMV.**   **","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I may be able to change your view through actions. What is the longest period that you have abstained from porn and masturbation together?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently sitting at ~12 days, and my sex drive is up. I used to be mainly attracted to women in porn, but now I feel like I want to have sex with (almost) any woman.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the way, you have a misconception regarding what NoFap is about. NoFap is about abstaining from porn, not fapping. It&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;porn&lt;/em&gt; that messes you up, not masturbation. You were built for (occasional) physical stimulation, but you were &lt;em&gt;most certainly not&lt;/em&gt; built for porn. In one porn session, you are &amp;quot;having sex&amp;quot; with more women than your ancestors even saw fully clothed in their entire lifetimes. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We abstain from fapping as well because fapping often leads to porn because our brains have connected fapping with porn. Once the porn addiction has been eliminated, you can begin fapping again if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Porn is an addiction, and an extreme one at that. So I ask you again, what is your current record for abstience from porn and masturbation together?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;edit: grammar and wording&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am sorry but I thought that NoFAp was for a short period of time and the purpose is clearly defeined as &amp;quot;to casually participate in a NoFap week or monthly challenge as a test of self control, or if fapping (or pornography!) has become an addictive problem in your life&amp;quot;. I highly doubt that anybody would not be able to understand the difference between real sex and a porn video. NoFap is just a game of self-control as far as I see it, there really should no affect of NoFap on how you see women or sex. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV:/r/politics name should be changed to /r/democratic party,"I used to think /r/politics was what it said: ""the subreddit for current and explicitly political U.S. news and information only.""   But it's not, as information is generally spun, and generally there is no discourse when information is presented.    /r/politics is nothing but a subreddit to defend the Democratic Party and trash the Republican Party, libertarians, or any other political ideas that don't conform to the party. The posts tolerated and the people who regularly visit the subreddit are clearly Democratic or lean Democratic.   One example of this is when I try to post anything about the President's drone attacks, the posts immediately get down voted. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/26ag9h/obama_killed_this_16yearold_american_without/) was shared on /r/politics and was -6 before I took it down. As you could see, on /r/libertarian it lately is at 990.   It is misleading to those unfamiliar with the politics subreddit because they feel they are actually visiting a subreddit that is open to all ideas, not just a narrow scope.

"I believe all victimless crimes, including prostitution and drug use should be legalized. CMV","First let me lay down some examples of victimless crimes  * individual purchase and consumption of recreational drugs (provided one does not hurt anyone else due to the effects)  * prostitution and/or soliciting for prostitution public nudity or fornication (providing there are no witnesses that have not consented)  * the consumption of pornography (not involving coercion)  * depiction of cartoon child porn (not involving harm to actual children)  * sexting between minors (voluntary action)  * the absence of a seatbelt in a car   I'm not saying the Government should condone the use of drugs, prostitution, or not wearing a seatbelt. What I *am* saying is I don't believe the government should have any say in what people do to themselves assuming it doesn't harm anyone, it isn't their job to make things they don't like illegal. If Someone wants to do meth, I don't think its the governments job to detain them. If someone decides they are willing to be a prostitute to make money, or a minor wants to sext their partner I really don't think the government has any reason to step in and punish them. The war on drugs (in the US at least) has been a huge failure, not only has it failed to dramatically lower instance of drug abuse but it has also put hundreds of thousands of Americans in the prison system. Minors have unregulated access to pretty much any illegal drug, more so than alcohol and tabacco which are regulated.   I believe the government should regulate drugs, and prostitution. But aside from that people should have unregulated freedoms assuming they aren't hurting anyone.   **So CMV! I think this is an interesting discussion and a lot of good points can be made on both sides :)**  **Edit: This sub is great :) Every comment I've seen has made thought provoking points! You guys rock !!**","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The major issue I always have with these arguments are that you may think &amp;quot;victimless crimes&amp;quot; are always self-inflicted but they generally harm everyone else indirectly (and sometimes directly). They are to protect yourself (and others) from yourself. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Example 1:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I am a meth addict. I decide I want to do meth all day and I am not harming anyone but myself. I overdose and my buddy calls an ambulance to come pump my stomach. As my ambulance is taking me back, there is someone who had a heart attack in the room next to me and is in need of an ambulance. I have just tied up resources because I have decided to do harm to myself and possibly caused harm to the person next door.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Example 2:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I am a driver in a vehicle. I chose not to wear a seatbelt. I got into a medium speed collision with another vehicle, nobody was at fault. Instead of being restrained to my seat, I flew partially through the windshield and have broken my neck. If I had buckled up, I would have maybe had a few bruises and that is it. I now have to sit in a hospital for several months taking up hospital space, doctors time, nurse time, physiotherapists&amp;#39; time and time from other individuals because I did not wish to buckle up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Example 3:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I am on some sort of hallucinogenic drug. I have taken far too much, but I have decided it is my body, I can do with it as I please. I am having a lot of fun running around my house. I decide I can fly. I look out the window and jump. I splatter on the ground and traumatize a child nearby who saw my body explode into many little pieces.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Obviously, these are extreme examples (and may be far over-dramatic) but I think it gets to the point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not wearing your seatbelt does not just impact you. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re the driver I can immediately think of a couple ways in which you not wearing your seatbelt impacts a lot of other people:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you lose control of your car, through no fault of your own or otherwise, you&amp;#39;re going to have a much better chance of mitigating the risk to those around you and of regaining control of the situation if you aren&amp;#39;t flying around your car or trying to remain upright through the g-forces of an uncontrolled skid or spin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get in an accident and are killed the resulting costs and traffic delays are higher. When a fatality happens the police take different measures than they would in a simple injury crash. If a reconstructionist needs to come in and it&amp;#39;s the middle of the night in a rural area the resulting delays can get really really long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even being a passenger can have impacts on others if you&amp;#39;re not wearing your seatbelt. If we were in a crash together I would appreciate it if you didn&amp;#39;t suddenly become a big meat bag flying around and/or crushing me up against the side of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I believe 9/11 was an inside job. CMV,"Around my senior year of high school (2009-ish) I became quite interested in public events and foreign relations and wanted to become more knowledgeable about how the United States compared to the other nations without the star-spangled bias you get from public school and fox news. Not too long after that I was exposed to 9/11: In Plane Site as well as others, and the copious amounts of conspiracy videos of YouTube. As someone of above average intelligence and a skeptic by nature I have never taken conspiracy theories too seriously, as many rely on sparse circumstantial evidence but for whatever reason this feels different.  My main reasons for suspecting foul play in order of importance:  1. BUILDING 7!?!? 2. The buildings all collapsed uniformly at near free fall speed implying a coordinated severance of support beams along with pictures showing 45 degree angled cuts on support beams not consistent with melting the columns. 3. Multiple Eye-witness accounts of explosion coming from the basement and bottom floor, along with the janitor that was in basements burns. 4. Traces of nano-thermite in the dust collected from the scene.  Im honestly not sure what to make of all this evidence, but something just strikes me as unsettling, and I see a lot of skeptics to whom I look up to (Micheal Shermer, Bill Maher to a lesser degree, etc.) dismissing the notion and Im not sure what Im overlooking that they arent. Im swearing into the Navy on Wednesday and this is the my biggest cause of apprehension about joining the war machine so hopefully one or more of you fine people can CMV!          disclaimer: First Post so I apologize in advance if I am in violation of any rules or protocol  EDIT: That didn't take long. Thanks to those who responded, now I'll rejoin the ranks of the lurkers.  EDIT #2: So a SHIT TON of new comments over night, and sorry to say I cant address them individually, not that yall are craving my opinion, but I read them all and its good to note that other seemingly intelligent people shared my concerns and skepticism and I really enjoyed the healthy discourse below. Both sides have produced compelling arguments but after reassessing probability figures and relinquishing my right to observe evidence and draw my own conclusions due to my egregious lack of knowledge on the subject, the reality is that it would be insurmountably difficult to orchestrate something of this magnitude. I still think its a little fishy, but my common sense tells me thats probably due to authorities lack of a clear picture, not direct involvement and subsequent cover up. Thanks again for playing, hope to see you all again.   EDIT #3: here is a [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1korgs/the_official_megalist_of_911_suspicious/) to a post in /r/conspiracy detailing the arguments that cast doubt on the official story in much better detail than I had previously. Another redditor brought that to my attention and thought you guys may have a go at it.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There really isn&amp;#39;t anything fishy about building 7, there were many people all over the place, and you&amp;#39;re going to be able to get multiple eye witnesses who will claim to have seen just about anything. There are even people who claim that they clearly saw a missile, not a plane hit the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The nano-thermite is just complete bullshit, through and through. Not only would it simply not work, the &amp;quot;study&amp;quot; that claimed to find traces was a pile of garbage.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This site does a good job of explaining why it&amp;#39;s nonsense: &lt;a href=""http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_9_11_truth_movement_the_top_conspiracy_theory_a_decade_later/""&gt;http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_9_11_truth_movement_the_top_conspiracy_theory_a_decade_later/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both sides have produced compelling arguments...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The thing is, that the truthers really &lt;em&gt;haven&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; produced compelling arguments. They&amp;#39;ve produced arguments that might sound compelling to laymen, but there really aren&amp;#39;t any credible experts who see &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; suspect about WTC 7&amp;#39;s collapse.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The thing that really puts the nail in the coffin for 9/11 conspiracy theories is: what the fuck was the point of the whole thing? Was it necessary in order to go to war with Iraq? Fuck no, we already went to war with Iraq once, and we sure as hell didn&amp;#39;t need a giant false flag attack to pull that off. Fabricating the attacks would have required &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of people working on the inside, being complicit in the most enormous criminal act in the history of the government... you&amp;#39;d have to be completely insane to risk attempting to pull something like that off.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a more plausible story: With events like the bombing of the USS Cole bombing in 2000 in mind, the Bush administration felt that further Al Qaeda attacks might help to build support for the idea of military action in the middle east, and avoided acting on intelligence that could have helped them bring down Bin Laden or learn more about potential attacks. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, what they pictured was perhaps further attacks on US bases in the mid east, or at worst, a repeat of the 1993 WTC bombing (which left 6 people dead). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What happened, though, was that the terrorists came up with a plan that&amp;#39;s brilliance was how amateur it was. Truthers act like &lt;em&gt;there&amp;#39;s no way&lt;/em&gt; these guys could have pulled something like that off, which strikes me as ludicrous, they believe that the government is capable of faking the whole thing in a giant, extremely convoluted plan, but the idea of breaking into an airplane cockpit with box cutters and taking control of a plane is implausible? Sometimes there&amp;#39;s also a faint air of racism in this incredulity... &amp;quot;Of course a group of intelligent white men could orchestrate a giant terror hoax, but there&amp;#39;s no way a bunch of brown guys could put together a plan to take down the WTC&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Airplanes have been hijacked hundreds of times, so that&amp;#39;s hardly new, and the idea of using a plane as a weapon is pretty old too, dating back at least to kamikaze pilots, and probably earlier. Frankly, it&amp;#39;s more surprising that nobody thought to do something like this earlier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi filthytom333. I don&amp;#39;t have the time to go into all of the details, so let me attempt to change your mind in a different way. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First off, I want to say that I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re crazy or stupid for believing something like this. Let&amp;#39;s be honest, our government has done some horrible things, and some the incidents that caused us to go to war have been of a questionable nature: &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident""&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With that said, there is a tendency amongst people to take very complicated and confusing information for which no easy answers exist, and fit them into a framework that helps them make sense of the world. When it comes to issues of politics, war, and the economy, some of the more extreme folk will craft incredibly far-fetched answers that often involve shady, wealthy, back-room puppeteers who seem to pull the strings and have a hand in nearly every major catastrophe in the world. I&amp;#39;m sure you know where I&amp;#39;m going with this, but these are the people who are often called &lt;em&gt;conspiracy theorists&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m not instinctively opposed to whatever they say--if there is evidence, then let it be examined no matter how crazy of a conclusion it points to--but the problem with conspiracy theorists is that they operate like religious fundamentalists. They get themselves into a sort of logical loop by where any attempt to argue against them further reinforces their convictions. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let me explain. If I was to approach a religious fundamentalist (someone who mainstream religious folk would call crazy, or &amp;quot;out there&amp;quot;) and try to convince them that perhaps God doesn&amp;#39;t exist or that he does exist, but they&amp;#39;re interpreting the Bible the wrong way, they would likely pull back further into their delusional, extreme thinking. After all, &lt;em&gt;of course I would try to convince them of otherwise, this is just their faith being tested&lt;/em&gt;. The very fact that I&amp;#39;m trying to convince them of something else is seen as evidence that their beliefs are correct--for they knew that they would be challenged. My life has brought me in contact with some of these people, and I assure you that this is exactly what they do. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Conspiracy theorists operate in a similar manner. I also have a few friends who believe that stuff, and I just don&amp;#39;t ever talk about it around them. If I argue with them, then I&amp;#39;ve &amp;quot;drank the Kool-Aid&amp;quot;, or I need to &amp;quot;open my eyes and start &lt;em&gt;thinking for myself&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been brainwashed by my culture and all of the giant corporations that want me to be their slave&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On a certain level, I sympathize with these people. I understand the anger and feeling of helplessness. I used to work in Washington DC, I&amp;#39;ve been to some high-level, closed-door political strategy meetings, and I left politics with a bad taste in my mouth. There&amp;#39;s some really fucked up shit happening, and good, average, every-day people are getting screwed over royally. I get it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But once you go down the conspiracy theorist hole, it&amp;#39;s a never-ending cycle of seeing some evil, all-powerful, boogyman around every corner. Just go to Infowars.com and see what I mean. Literally (and I mean literally) &lt;em&gt;every major incident&lt;/em&gt; that happens is &lt;em&gt;blamed on a conspiracy&lt;/em&gt; or given a &lt;em&gt;far-fetched, alternate explanation&lt;/em&gt;. I once saw Alex Jones claim that the tornadoes which destroyed a town here in the United States may have been caused by a government weather machine. It just doesn&amp;#39;t end, and sadly Infowars doesn&amp;#39;t even begin to scratch the surface of the paranoid talk that a conspiracy theorist can find convincing. Talk to some folks in the survivalist community if you want to see what I mean. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But back to your question, I have to place the 9/11 &amp;quot;inside job&amp;quot; hypothesis in the same category as other conspiracy theories. I&amp;#39;m not one of the guys who outright dismissed such claims--I&amp;#39;ll give anything consideration as long as the evidence is there--but right now there is just too much speculation. Yes, there is some stuff that gives a person reason to pause and think &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot;. Yes, there are some questions that do not have answers. But that&amp;#39;s to be expected in such an unexpected event, and there are very, very few credible and serious individuals who put any stock in such claims. Besides, I find it laughable that the government could keep something like that a secret for over ten years. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now with that said, if documents come out in five or six years that implicate the government, or evidence starts mounting that points to something other than terrorists, then I&amp;#39;d be willing to give it a second chance. But right now, the only people who seem to be convinced by claims of an inside job are those who tend to engage in conspiratorial thinking. The major proponents of this idea are on &lt;em&gt;YouTube videos&lt;/em&gt; with ominous music and narrators that are trying way too hard to scare the shit out of viewers. Like I said, I understand the motivations and concerns of people who are susceptible to this type of thinking, but sometimes you just have to accept that the world is far more complicated than evil corporations who try to subdue the people, Bohemian Grove meetings about how to turn John Q Public into a slave, and shadow governments comprised of billionaire elites who fund the politicians to pacify the people with republican vs democrat. While we&amp;#39;re used to the day-to-day order and structure of living under a government, international relations largely takes place in anarchy. The relationships between nation-states are not governed by any larger body; it&amp;#39;s a very, very complicated subject and it&amp;#39;s not easily reduced down to the framework that&amp;#39;s been accepted by your average Infowars viewer. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Do you see any reason that this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a conspiracy theory?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Best of luck to you in the Navy, by the way!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I do not think that gaming qualifies as a form of artistic expression. CVM,"Time and again I see my ""gamer"" friends whittling away their lives in front of the latest Call of Duty or whatever. When I ask them about it, I get some kind of one-off explanation about how it's all art. Sure, actually making games qualifies as some kind of art, but I wouldn't sit in front of the mona lisa for 6 hours a day and consider myself a painter.   Edit to clarify a little: Video games are art, but I have seen people play video games excessively to the extent where it becomes a major aspect of their lives and validate their ""gaming"" by stating that it is an art form. All consumption and no production negates this excuse in my opinion.   **Final Edit: I didn't know what to expect from this, but holy cow am I humbled. I was in the mindset that art and art appreciation must manifest itself in the same way (i.e. If you collect paintings, you must be a painter for that to be meaningful.) I now see that any kind of art appreciation (including gaming) is bound to find another outlet. While I still do not think gaming is the pinnacle of artistic expression, I do recognize it as one now. I definitely see it as legitimate art appreciation. That was totally unexpected, reddit.

CMV: The use of hyperbole in politics ultimately undermines your own side and radicalizes groups you oppose,"Baseless accusations of extreme positions have the effect of making those positions seem more palatable.  For example, when Rush Limbaugh and his ilk call everyone they don't like a socialist, it desensitizes people to the ideology. Liberals keep getting called socialists, and it makes socialism seem a lot more palatable to the average person, emboldening actual socialists and legitimizing them in the eyes of society. People are going to look at that and think ""OK, if supporting affordable health care makes me a socialist, then I guess I'm a socialist.""  Similarly when SRS types accuse anyone vaguely critical of far-left orthodoxies of being a racist or sexist, it turns these positions from the fringe to the mainstream. Moderate conservatives and libertarians are constantly being baselessly attacked as being racist or sexist, what are they going to think? ""OK, so wanting tax reform makes me a racist, then I guess I'm a racist."" ""OK, so believing in due process rights makes me a sexist, then I guess I'm a sexist."" This again breaks down sensitivities, and makes non-imaginary instances of racism and sexism seem less abhorrent.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The left has become so afraid of hyperbole that they&amp;#39;ve slowly shifted to the right over the decades.  In the recent Congressional elections they were terrified to be associated with Obamacare and &amp;quot;socialism.&amp;quot;  That&amp;#39;s because, unfortunately, heuristic thinking is effective on a wide-scale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;EDIT:  In fact, I think Bernie Sanders is the only Senator to actually claim the title of &amp;quot;socialist.&amp;quot;  I think your theory is disproved by the simple fact that liberals get called socialists all the time, but the only one to call themselves a socialist is an independent!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moderate conservatives and libertarians are constantly being baselessly attacked as being racist or sexist, what are they going to think? &amp;quot;OK, so wanting tax reform makes me a racist, then I guess I&amp;#39;m a racist.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;OK, so believing in due process rights makes me a sexist, then I guess I&amp;#39;m a sexist.&amp;quot; This again breaks down sensitivities, and makes non-imaginary instances of racism and sexism seem less abhorrent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not so sure about that.  There&amp;#39;s always an extremist on every side, and I find that generally if you accuse a moderate of being extreme, the first thing they do is point to the extreme saying &amp;quot;this is dumb, I&amp;#39;m clearly not like them.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; being a member of that extreme is why they end up holding the same position.  They&amp;#39;re able to completely disregard the opinion of the person making the accusations because the accusation seems to extreme itself.  It&amp;#39;s a way of insulating yourself from the criticism rather than associating yourself with the criticism&amp;#39;s comparison. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyperbole is a very effective tool to seize control of a debate or issue when you don&amp;#39;t have more substantive evidence to stand on.  Calling someone a &amp;quot;socialist&amp;quot; or comparing them to &amp;quot;nazis&amp;quot; is called a &amp;quot;Strawman argument&amp;quot; - it&amp;#39;s used to &lt;em&gt;attack the messenger, ignore the message&lt;/em&gt; and dismiss his argument without due consideration.   The right very effectively use this technique to push through various issue-positions that do not have the real-world references to back them up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, many people who hold positions on certain issues, do so not because they&amp;#39;ve rationally arrived at a thoughtful conclusion based on available evidence.  It&amp;#39;s an emotional position.  And hyperbole is targeted at peoples&amp;#39; emotions.   Likewise, when trying to &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot; with a person who holds an unreasonable position, logic and thoughtful argument doesn&amp;#39;t often work.  Mockery and shame is a time-tested tactic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t approve of it,  not at all.  But there is no doubt that using these techniques is very effective in manipulating people, especially those who are averse to doing their own homework and coming up with their own conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hyperbole is used very effectively in a number of scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religion - most religions use &lt;em&gt;shame&lt;/em&gt; as a tactic to impose order, obedience and conformity.  It&amp;#39;s the basis of the Judeo-Christian sects for sure.  Mankind is &amp;quot;cursed&amp;quot; and must &amp;quot;atone&amp;quot;.  That&amp;#39;s an emotional appeal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk radio and right wingers use strawman arguments, false dichotomies (suggesting issues are one-extreme or the other, i.e. &amp;quot;If you don&amp;#39;t support invading xxxx then you hate America.&amp;quot;), false equivalences (both sides of an issue are equally at fault, etc.) -- all of these techniques are methods of misdirecting debate in favor of personal attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberals use these techniques as well, recently evidenced by the current &amp;quot;anti-vaxxer&amp;quot; arguments online - anyone who expresses concern over vaccinations is often personally attacked and publicly humiliated.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Do these things tend to polarize and exclude people from thoughtful debate and compromise?   I think yes, in some cases, but I think in other cases there is also evidence that trying to reason with an unreasonable person is an exercise in futility -- and in those cases, more hyperbolic engagement does make a difference.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think if you cite extreme examples on each side of this issue, they play into the scenario you have adopted and I wouldn&amp;#39;t disagree with you, but this is also a false dichotomy.   There are many in-between shades of gray, where sometimes it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be effective to mix rational debate with a bit of hyperbole and emotional appeal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think the biggest misconception in all, is the notion that anybody&amp;#39;s point of view will be immediately, dramatically changed as a result of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; argument.  This just isn&amp;#39;t the way these things work.  Usually &amp;quot;seeds of dissenting ideas&amp;quot; are planted by opposing forces, and those seeds take time to germinate and grow within the other person.  Those seeds can be planted by both rational, respectful discourse, or through hyperbole and emotional appeals.   Usually, the more difficult ideas to undermine require a lot of time, and a lot of emotional appeals.   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"CMV:Learning how to do your taxes, budgeting and finance, emergency medical training, and leadership skills should be required to be taught in high schools.","I probably can solve algebraic equations, recite parts of the periodic table, and write a decent essay, but what I don’t have are the skills to be successful after I graduate from college (If I am lucky enough to do so). I enjoy that high school taught me how to write well, and that skill will guide me all throughout my life. However, I think it is important for high schools to balance their curriculum with more practical skills than theoretical. I know some basic information on taxes through my government class, however, I have not a clue how to balance a checkbook or fill out an i-9 form. You may think I am ignorant: and I know I shouldn’t spend more money than I have, but other than that I am seemingly unequipped to tackle the duties and hardships of financial life after University. My school also never taught me protocol if someone chokes, or if someone is having a heart attack. Obviously I won’t be in situations where someone is having a heart attack everyday, but I really think knowing how to save a human life is more important than solving a geometric proof.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV: I have a serious hate for the majority of people.,"I spend so much time on the internet and it seems like everywhere I go people are being complete fucking idiots.  I'm always hearing stories about how people threaten to rape and kill people on twitter and telling people to kill themselves purely based on them having a different opinion than them, I see it all the time on forums and stuff too and it's often up voted by people.  It's also the little things that get to me, like in an online game I play it's usually considered polite to say ""good luck have fun"" at the beggining of the game and ""good game"" at the end, which I always do since I try to be a nice person but it seems like 70% of the time people don't do this and often tell me to kill myself and other things instead.  Plus if you look at the most subscribed youtube channels pretty much all of them are filled with some of the most stupid immature rubbish but it still gets millions of views.  I don't see people acting like this that often in real life but that's the thing, people can act however they want to online since they're anonymous, lots of people act like how I've been talking about while I try to be a nice person, because why wouldn't I? I really hate making other people feel especially for no reason.   I try very hard to be a nice person which I guess is both my biggest strength and weakness. I've often tried to be generous with buying things for people, like steam games or just letting them keep any money they owe me etc, but it seems like people often take advantage of that. One time I decided to give someone a game on steam since they got a new pc (just as a friendly gesture) but they never gave me anything back (that wasn't the reason I gave them something, I just feel like I would of done if I was them) they just kept asking me If I had anymore games for them and then unfriended me when I didn't give them any  Also when I was at school there was a very sweet boy with adhd, people used to be really mean to him and do things like hide his clothes and spray deodorant in his face, I just don't get it. how can people act like that?  A few months ago a popular youtube games critic made a vlog saying that he had got cancer, the point of the video was saying that he made a stupid mistake, didn't get himself checked when he was having problems and didn't want other people to make the same mistake. I found tons of posts and comments (often upvoted ones) pretty much laughing at him and saying that ""it was karma"" because one got angry when someone was harassing him and his family online. He know people would act like this and he was most likely very embarrassed by it but he wanted to do something selfless, he was worse of for making that video and the people laughing at him were enjoying laughing at him.  The worst part to me is that it seems like the people who try to be nice often get screwed over and the opposite happens to the idiots.  I try to convince myself it's just the vocal minority but judging by how often I see people acting like this then I struggle to believe it, especially with my point about the popular youtube channels.  It may not sound like much and I probably sound pretty arrogant when I say it but I have to be honest and things build up a lot I guess.  basically it seems like it's the majority, or atleast very close that seem to act like this now and not just the vocal minority. sorry about the poor wording in some of this, I'm not used to writing anything longer than a comment.  Edit: it's not also just in the first world, you look at way ISIS and several other places treats people, it's unbelievable. same applies to how some people can treat animals without caring at all, the amount of animal cruelty that goes on, especially in places like china makes be angry beyond belief, and how most people don't seem to care about it. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If none of it is relevant to you, please disregard it. :)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My first thought: get off the internet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My second thought: use your new free time to go volunteer somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While people are capable of some pretty nasty things by themselves, the internet is a mess. I don&amp;#39;t know why. Maybe it amplifies the negative, maybe it&amp;#39;s the anonymity, maybe it&amp;#39;s all the emotional context that gets lost in text, who knows. But in my experience it&amp;#39;s a lot easier to be cynical about people when you don&amp;#39;t interact with real people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for volunteering, it may seem kind of random but I can think of several ways in which it could help. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will spend time with people who spend their free time doing helpful, constructive things. These people are usually pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You yourself will be a person who does helpful things in your free time. I&amp;#39;ve always found it easy to be optimistic about other people when I feel good about what I&amp;#39;m doing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on where you volunteer you will serve people, and I think it&amp;#39;s never easier to love people than when you&amp;#39;re trying to serve them, even if they&amp;#39;re kind of jerks. I got punched in the face outside a soup kitchen once and I still feel positively about all my time there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also when I say volunteer I don&amp;#39;t necessarily mean humanitarian service. Help do tech for a community play, help out at a bicycle collective. Just getting involved regularly with other people in a constructive way &lt;em&gt;in real life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It may not change the nature of humanity, but it may help change your view of which side tends to dominate in real people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to talk to you, OP.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I want to talk to you as a human being. I want to tell you a story about something that happened to me at work. I work a software support job; I help people troubleshoot technical and usage issues with my company&amp;#39;s software. It&amp;#39;s, at its core, a customer service job, and there are certainly downsides. But this isn&amp;#39;t one of those stories. It is easy to just say &amp;quot;Customers are assholes&amp;quot; and be cynical and closed off and bitter about everything, so I try not to do that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There was an issue that came in not too long ago that was urgent and very difficult; it involved a part of our software that I specialize in, so I grabbed the case and called the client. The client, we&amp;#39;ll call her Megan, was very panicked and kind of angry. So, I got to work troubleshooting. We made some progress and fixed the most urgent thing, but then there was a more difficult issue that took me 2-3 hours and a dozen database queries to pin down. During this time, Megan had calmed down considerably and was engaging me in pleasant conversation while I worked, and we chatted amicably about our lives. I learned that she lives in Canada and has a teenage daughter. I also learned that we share a sense of humor, as we were both making each other laugh throughout this entire ordeal, making stupid puns and generally just being goofy with each other. At the end of a late day (a Friday, no less), we&amp;#39;d finally nailed everything down, and we were still chatting for another 20 minutes after we could&amp;#39;ve just gone about our Friday nights.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She and I still keep in touch, and are friendly. Now, here&amp;#39;s the twist ending: This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; unusual for me doing my job. I have plenty of clients who know me by name, who ask me how my day is going even when I&amp;#39;m not working with them, and who, as far as I can tell, to some degree enjoy my company, and I enjoy theirs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m not some super-social creature who goes around mingling; I&amp;#39;m extremely shy outside of work and the internet. The key, I think, is that I associate the voice on the other end of the phone with another human being, who probably laughs at corny jokes, has their own set of life experience, who has likely loved and lost, who has their own set of priorities and needs and stressors that all affect their interactions with the world. The difference is, and I think this is important: I hear their voice, and they hear mine. We can communicate through intonation and I can hear the inflections in their voice and understand the messages that aren&amp;#39;t spoken in words. This amplifies in person, when you can see body language.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, this is, I think, the answer to using &amp;quot;the internet&amp;quot; as a source; when you are separated from the other &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt; by a witty user avatar, a wall of emotionless text, and careful editing, there isn&amp;#39;t as much &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; to respond to. Words on a page aren&amp;#39;t a person talking, they&amp;#39;re &lt;em&gt;information&lt;/em&gt;, nothing more. You can&amp;#39;t hear the tone of my voice, or see my face, so why should you care about me as a person? That is what the internet does for us; it is way, way easier to be a dick on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for the other part: yes, the real world isn&amp;#39;t immune to assholes. Some people are just selfish, and that&amp;#39;s a sad fact. But the world is also full of good things, and good people; the problem with getting your information about the world at large is that the news is far from unbiased; they decide what stories to run, and the way they decide that is based on how many butts they&amp;#39;ll put in seats/how many issues they&amp;#39;ll sell. The fact is that they don&amp;#39;t report on people being decent human beings because that isn&amp;#39;t interesting. Moreover, they don&amp;#39;t report on people being decent human beings because that isn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt;. Now, you might think that that&amp;#39;s a bad thing, but I think that it is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; that being kind isn&amp;#39;t so rare as to be newsworthy! &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you need more convincing, take a look here: &lt;a href=""http://www.cracked.com/forums/topic/23218/the-pwot-happiness-generator""&gt;http://www.cracked.com/forums/topic/23218/the-pwot-happiness-generator&lt;/a&gt; it&amp;#39;s essentially a repository for fuzzy feel-good things, many of them news stories, and those are just the most exceptional examples that managed modest coverage on some obscure or local sources.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As cheesy as it is, I firmly believe that the internet will show you what you want to see. If you go looking for the good in humanity, you will find it. But if you go looking for the bad, you will find it as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Democracies should not prosecute ex-leaders for crimes in office.,"**Edit:** View [partly changed](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/35007e/cmv_democracies_should_not_prosecute_exleaders/cqzpsh4) by /u/Tricerabear in respect to mature democracies since most/all would have their militaries defy orders from an illegitimate President.  So I am thinking about this a bit in the US context, such as Ford's pardon of Nixon, and Obama's decision not to prosecute Bush or Cheney for torture.  But I am certainly open to non-American examples as well.  The threat of prosecution undermines peaceful transition of power.  Peaceful transition of power between political adversaries is the defining feature of a democracy governed by the rule of law.  If you do not peacefully transition power, you're not a democracy.  The threat of prosecution is deeply corrosive to the willingness of leaders to give up power.  If the opposition makes clear they intend to imprison you upon their victory, you are not likely to hand over the reins of power to them.  Even for a leader engaged in open criminality like Nixon, we should be willing to offer a plea of no prosecution in exchange for surrendering the power of office.  It is more important that the office transfer peacefully and within the confines of the law than it is that a particular person be put in prison.  Egypt's recent history is indicative of this to me.  The prosecutions of Mubarak, then Morsi, then undoing Mubarak have made it wildly implausible that any leader who takes power in Egypt again would hand over office willingly, since your opposition will drag you off to prison for some charge, legitimate or no.  **TL;DR: Peaceful transition of power is more important than achieving retribution for crimes.**   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The willingness of a president to give up power doesn&amp;#39;t matter at all. It&amp;#39;s not up to him or her. He/She has to give up power because he/she was voted out of office or had their term expire.

TheRedPill theory is just an out for men who have had shitty relationships all their lives. CMV,"Disclosures: I'm 24, male, formerly of the Soviet Union/Ukraine/Russia, now living in America since 1995; I mention the heritage because my time spent on the other side of the iron curtain is frequent enough to factor into my opinions on feminism/mens rights.  This isn't a topic for the rape question regarding TRP and the other lasso-the-wimminz subreddits. This is in regards specifically to TRP theory, whether it is truly at the core of TRP followers or not.  I'll be honest; I find it to be an extremely interesting viewpoint to have and the theory itself is interesting if there's a debate to be had. Regardless, I find it to be an incredibly silly place for men who have given up on women, people who are ""formerly beta"" yet don't have the minerals to keep searching for someone who will take care of them and instead try to control the situation by being alpha.  In other words, someone who swallows the Red Pill is basically a person who has had one shitty relationship after another or (worse) one extremely long shitty relationship where the girl was looking out only for herself and they were finally able to find solace by viewing it as fact that this is simply the way the world works: women are manipulative (if only unconsciously) and look out only for themselves so there are no good, *completely* fulfilling relationships with women to be had. But the solace comes in the form that at least they are going to be men about it by taking a long, pessimistic tug on their cigarette, say ""life is shit"", accept it, and make the best of it by making sure the woman never leaves them through a kind of pseudo-reverse-psychology.  Again, please stick to the theory and not how it actually gets implemented by the users unless you really truly feel that it's pertinent and fundamental to also how the theory works. CMV!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i dont entirely agree with TRP theory. but i can see how it came about. there are 2 situations that occur when you&amp;#39;re a &amp;quot;nice guy&amp;quot;. you get lucky and find a woman who isn&amp;#39;t manipulative and takes advantage of you, or you&amp;#39;re not lucky and you meet 1 or many women who manipulate you, on purpose or not. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;let&amp;#39;s talk about the second situation, as the first is pretty much solved, they get lucky they have a great lasting relationship, awesome. let&amp;#39;s say a guy gets used by a girl in the most extreme of friendzone situations. she strings him along, flirts with him often, but never wants anything more. worse yet when it seems like he has a chance with other women she&amp;#39;ll purposely sabotage it. maybe she&amp;#39;ll give him bad advice, maybe she&amp;#39;ll be more obvious like hanging on to him in front of the girl, or bad mouthing him to that girl. so the guy finally figures this out and stops being friends with the girl. at that point he&amp;#39;s going to have to stop and figure out why this happened. you can say well that girl was just a bad person. but that&amp;#39;s not the only factor in it happening. if the guy wasn&amp;#39;t so eager to please her so quickly and not so bound by the idea that he has to be nice to a fault, she never could have taken advantage of him. that&amp;#39;s the key there, that for you to be taken advantage of by an unscrupulous woman, you have to let yourself be taken advantage of, at least on some level. it&amp;#39;s like someone who gets bullied for a long time then finally stands up for himself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;now i disagree with your assertion that the whole red pill theory is just a pessimistic, life is shit, and you have to accept it sentiment. it&amp;#39;s more about protecting yourself from being taken advantage of again in the future. there is absolutely no reason why changing your life from being a doormat to not, means you wont ever find meaningful relationships. look the fact is not all women are mature enough to realize the value of nice guys, so they take them for granted or abuse them. so a way to weed those kinds of women out of your life is to simply not allow them to take advantage of you. that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you suddenly see life as this horrible place that sucks, and there&amp;#39;s no fulfillment. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;look the fact of the matter is when you&amp;#39;re seeking someone to spend the rest of your life with you need a lot of things to mesh well, personality wise, hobby wise, etc. bending over backwards for every girl you meet is just a bad way to go about it. you waste too much time chasing girls whom you THINK are the perfect fit, 1 at a time. a much more successful method is simply to find many girls, broaden your perspective, so you can better figure out what qualities really mesh well with you. on top of that since you&amp;#39;re not the one constantly bending over backwards for someone being the only person trying to make a relationship work you&amp;#39;ll have a much easier time finding girls who actually really want to be with you. it&amp;#39;ll become clear cause these are the girls who try to make it work with you. if you like that girl then boom, THAT is the time to finally bring your nice guy side back out. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;think of it like having a girl earn the privilege of meeting the nice guy, the guy who will move mountains for her. instead of going through life constantly trying to move mountains for every girl you meet that you have a crush on, and then getting used to move mountains when the girl isn&amp;#39;t really interested in you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;that&amp;#39;s how i see TRP theory. by the way you mention your heritage, but you don&amp;#39;t mention how or why it factors into your opinion. could you elaborate?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll bite.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I got into Pickup and then Redpill theory without having ever had a bad relationship with women. In fact I was pretty young so I never had any relationships.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never felt bitter about it or anything.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But in any case the theorys that have been presented seem to fit in so well with what I see in day to day life. Time and time again practicing what I&amp;#39;ve learned seems to prove itself true. This could be confirmation bias except when I then go and try methods that everyone else recommends it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I find that Briffaults Law tends to apply itself to pretty much every relationship between women and men. That women do not stay in a relationship unless there is some sort of benefit for them (be it emotional or material). That being said I also think pretty much everyone is inherently selfish in a way. Even the do-gooders do it because it makes them feel good.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For me personally the core tenants of the redpill are what I apply to my interactions with girls every single time now and it works out well for me. I mean some call me an asshole, but those are the same girls that sooner or later come crawling back.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not bitter about it, or women. I love women and accept them for how they are and personally I prefer how things actually work to the supposed &amp;#39;disney&amp;#39; fantasy of what has been told. If a woman leaves my harem, why would I mind? She can always be replaced. I can look back on the good times without feeling bitter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: I really dislike the criticism ""overrated."" I think it's lazy and discouraging.","Hey, guys.  So, first of all, I wouldn't go as far as to say that I think the term ""overrated"" is meaningless. I think I understand exactly what people mean when they say it. I just don't personally find myself using it or thinking of something as being overrated, because of the way that I think about art and media, and I wish more people could see things the way I do.   But I'm looking for someone to shed some light on what they think overrated means, because maybe I'm taking it to an extreme that others are not.   What I mean is, generally when people say something is ""overrated,"" they mean, ""this is critically acclaimed or appreciated by a huge number of people, but I don't like it. Therefore, I don't understand why so many people like it, or I do not think it deserves the praise it gets.""  I personally do not believe in superlatives or assigning ""greatness"" to something that is purely subjective. I am a huge movie buff as some of you might know, but I don't have a personal list of ""greatest movies"" because I don't think you can rank movies based on which is ""best,"" since everyone has different criteria. However, if you asked me what the greatest movie ever is, I might say VERTIGO or CITIZEN KANE, because there is a consensus among critics that it is either one of those two movies. Therefore, when I say ""VERTIGO is the greatest,"" I am NOT stating an opinion, I am referring to the consensus of the canon of film criticism.   I think greatest in these sense refers to ""most influential"" or ""most written about"" or ""most often said to be the best by people who are in the business of saying such things,"" in which case ""greatest film"" could be an objective label, because I think influence and popularity are objective qualities, as opposed to the subjective act of enjoying something. I don't think there is necessarily one film that is MOST influential, but it is inarguable that some films are just more influential than others.  Let's move on to the Beatles: we all know that time and time again on CMV, it'll come up that someone thinks the Beatles are overrated. I think, based on my criteria for ""greatness,"" the Beatles are certainly great. It is hard to ignore the impact they had on pop culture and pop music, and they are undeniably legendary and well-cited in literature and criticism, and not without reason. When you say ""the Beatles are overrated,"" you're saying either, ""I don't like the greatest band of all time, so how can they be the greatest?"" or ""because I don't like them, they shouldn't have been the greatest band."" The former statement is going against my own interpretation of what people mean by greatest, as I said before. You are allowed to dislike the Beatles but still understand that they had this great impact. The second statement, whether they deserved to have had that impact, is prententiously insisting that your sole opinion is the only correct one. Rather than try to do research and understand the impact the Beatles had and figure out why they are called great, you just kind of gave up and decided that you HAD to like them, or they are automatically ""overrated.""  I think the problem is that people see things or listen to things called the greatest and assume it means that it is going to be the thing they enjoy the most. They hear that CITIZEN KANE is the greatest film of all time and think, well, that means that if I watch it I will have the most enjoyable experience I have ever had watching a movie. But CITIZEN KANE is considered great for reasons that are not readily apparent to the average, modern viewer. It's basically the 1941 equivalent of a Chris Nolan film: groundbreaking practical special effects (yes, they're so good that I bet most of you are scratching your heads wondering what effects I'm even referring to), temporally complex narrative, technical innovation, incredible camerawork, makeup, and a young and spirited director at the helm. It's great in its historical context, but its also great because critics ""decided"" it was great, and it became a sort of cultural meme that everyone just assumes is true. If you wanted to say, ""CITIZEN KANE is overrated because I have done extensive research and study and have written a peer-reviewed critical analysis demonstrating how it did not really have the great influence and impact that it had"" (something people have done) then you would be going somewhere. But if you said, ""CITIZEN KANE is overrated because I didn't like it,"" you are misunderstanding what is meant by ""great"" and you are too lazy to do the research to see why it earns that label.  Ultimately, you're just missing out on a chance to enrich your cultural understanding and find out why things are beloved in their context, even if you don't personally care for it. Personally, I have never found a single thing to be overrated, because even things I dislike, I understand WHY they are liked and why they are influential, because I am interested and invested in understanding popular culture. I know that not everyone is as into it as I am, but if you're not, why even make the criticism to begin with? And if you're posting to CMV saying something is overrated because you want to understand it, why not say ""I don't understand why people like this,"" rather than make the presumptuous statement that implies other people are wrong for liking it?

Let me give you an example of a case where it&amp;#39;s easy to determine whether something is underrated or overrated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the beginning of each sporting event season, various publications rank each team from first to last based on how well they think they&amp;#39;ll do.  At the end of the year, you can look at the final standings and see which teams were overrated and which were underrated.  A team that was predicted to come in 3rd but actually came in 10th was overrated. In other words, overrating is only relevant based on future performance.  You argue that whatever ranking is given now is incorrect based on what results will say in the future. Do you agree with this definition, at least for sports team rankings?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, things get muddier when you don&amp;#39;t have a clear ranking system.  There&amp;#39;s no final results for which movies or bands are best, instead what we have is a bunch of rating systems that change over time.  So in these cases, I would take overrated to mean, &amp;quot;this band is ranked highly in x system now, but in 20 years, it will be ranked much lower.&amp;quot;  X can mean popular opinion polls, or rolling stones top lists or whatever you choose.  Saying the Beatles are overrated means that while they consistently appear at the top of &amp;quot;best bands&amp;quot; lists in various media, in the future they will drop in popularity relative to other bands.  You are making a prediction about the future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;m sure people do use overrated to mean, &amp;quot;Everyone thinks this is good but I don&amp;#39;t&amp;quot; that&amp;#39;s not a good use for this word.  The word has &amp;quot;rate&amp;quot; in it which means that it only makes sense in the context of a rating scheme.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying something is &amp;quot;overrated&amp;quot; without explanation is generally bad, but so is most criticism without backing and explanation.  I can think of a few scenarios off my head where I think the term &amp;quot;overrated&amp;quot; can be used well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) Sports: many sports have official or unofficial rankings of teams and players.  Saying that that a team is &amp;quot;overrated&amp;quot; is a fair criticism if you can explain why another team should be rated ahead of them or why the team should be ranked lower.  This is one of the easiest usages of the term, because it&amp;#39;s explicitly clear where teams are rated, and their future play can help determine if that ranking was correct.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) You reference movies and music in your post.  Simply saying that &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt; or The Beatles are overrated is lazy, but if you can argue as to why a specific other movie or band should rated higher than them, that&amp;#39;s fair.  I can&amp;#39;t really speak for either of those personally, but if you say &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt; is overrated because people think it was really revolutionary because it invented [x], when actually [x] was done earlier and better by some other movie that I know,&amp;quot; I think that&amp;#39;s fair.  Saying &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt; is overrated because I like &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; more&amp;quot; is a bad criticism though, you&amp;#39;re right on that point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0

It cheapens the lot for legal immigrants and citizens alike if you get the same benefits regardless if you are legally present or not.

CMV: The Social Security Trust Fund is an Accounting Fiction.,"The Social Security Trust Fund is a set of special US Treasury bonds issued to the Social Security Administration.    The bonds provide a convenient accounting mechanism to keep track of the dedicated tax for Social Security, but they do not provide any extra security to the system, and are not in any way ""savings"" that the government could call on to pay Social Security benefits, or for any other purpose  The fundamental reason is that the bonds are owned by the same entity who issued them.  The Social Security Administration and the US Treasury are both subsidiaries of the US Government.  The US Government just owes money to itself.  Each year, the money to pay for Social Security benefits comes from payroll taxes, and to the extent that the SSA cashes in the bonds, the various other taxes the US government charges (income tax, tariffs, etc).  Kevin Drum [wrote a piece](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/12/social-security-trust-fund-is-real) on this a couple years ago that lays out the case on the other side.  &gt;Social Security surplus was invested in treasury bonds. What does that mean? It means that workers gave money to the federal government, which turned around and spent it. In return, the Social Security trust fund received bonds that represented promises to repay the money later out of the federal government's income tax receipts. In effect, it gave workers a claim on the income tax receipts of the government at a later date in time. When that time came, the federal government would have to pay up, which would make it less profitable. If the government was already running a deficit, it would make the deficit even worse.  The workers do *not* have a claim on the future tax receipts of the Federal government though.  Under US law, [there is no property interest in future Social Security payments.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5373695872604515216)  If the US Treasury defaulted on those bonds, the only entity who could sue would be the SSA, in a case titled United States v. United States.  Indeed, Congress has plenary discretion to alter or eliminate Social Security payments, and/or forgive the debts owed to the SSA by the US Treasury.  This makes it very much unlike other debt promises.  Congress would not be able to repudiate a public bond under the 14th Amendment (or 5th Amendment).  But they can revoke Social Security any time they want.  So there is no property interest.  It's a useful accounting fiction that lets the program keep track of the dedicated tax, but it does not represent meaningful savings or anything that Americans should consider a safeguard of their retirements, because it's just one hand owing money to the other.  Edit 1:  Would be curious for any replies related to what happens when the trust fund ""runs out.""  This is the area I'm most conflicted re: the realness of the fund. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ok, you&amp;#39;ve taken some half truths and you&amp;#39;ve jumped to some conclusions. Let&amp;#39;s start with the premise:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under US law, there is no property interest in future Social Security payments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s true. If you&amp;#39;re talking about &amp;quot;property&amp;quot; in the sense that payments into an &amp;quot;account&amp;quot; can be withdrawn later. But that&amp;#39;s not the only meaning of &amp;quot;property.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Any&lt;/em&gt; statutory entitlement is &amp;quot;property&amp;quot; for the purposes of the Due Process Clause after deprivation of that property. So the moment the Social Security Administration misses a payment, as calculated by the statutory formulas, the federal government (regular Treasury) must pay all plaintiffs who sue it. In that sense, &lt;a href=""http://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-14/37-due-process.html""&gt;it is &amp;quot;property&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Concurrently with the virtual demise of the &amp;quot;right-privilege&amp;quot; distinction, there arose the &amp;quot;entitlement&amp;quot; doctrine, under which the Court erected a barrier of procedural—but not substantive—protections against erroneous governmental deprivation of something it had within its discretion bestowed. Previously, the Court had limited due process protections to constitutional rights, traditional rights, common law rights and &amp;quot;natural rights.&amp;quot; Now, under a new &amp;quot;positivist&amp;quot; approach, a protected property or liberty interest might be found based on any positive governmental statute or governmental practice that gave rise to a legitimate expectation. Indeed, for a time it appeared that this positivist conception of protected rights was going to displace the traditional sources.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As noted previously, the advent of this new doctrine can be seen in Goldberg v. Kelly. In Goldberg, the Court held that, inasmuch as termination of welfare assistance may deprive an eligible recipient of the means of livelihood, the government must provide a pre-termination evidentiary hearing in which an initial determination of the validity of the dispensing agency&amp;#39;s grounds for termination could be made. In order to reach this conclusion, the Court found that such benefits &amp;quot;are a matter of statutory entitlement for persons qualified to receive them.&amp;quot; Thus, where the loss or reduction of a benefit or privilege was conditioned upon specified grounds, it was found that the recipient had a property interest entitling him to proper procedure before termination or revocation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ok, so people who reach the statutory qualifications for receiving Social Security benefits would be able to sue. (In fact, people already do that today when wrongly denied Social Security benefits, especially under the disability or survivor programs). That doesn&amp;#39;t mean that Congress can&amp;#39;t change the program, either, but it also doensn&amp;#39;t mean that Congress can&amp;#39;t just pay Social Security&amp;#39;s obligations out of the general Treasury accounts. It does it with Medicare, and that cost has been growing faster than revenue and faster than inflation for decades now.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would be curious for any replies related to what happens when the trust fund &amp;quot;runs out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Social Security trust fund was created in the 1980&amp;#39;s and designed to &amp;quot;run out&amp;quot; around the time the Boomers all die off. That generation is the only one expected to have a disproportionate number of retirees (aka Social Security beneficiaries) compared to the number of workers. Once they die off, a stable ratio of 65+ to 18-65 should be restored (although slightly higher than historical because of lower birth rate and higher life expectancy), and the program should stabilize for at about 6.1% of GDP. That&amp;#39;s hardly a recipe for disaster (and in fact, so much else can go wrong instead before 2088). &lt;a href=""http://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/""&gt;There&amp;#39;s more information here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Basically, the big problem is Medicare, not Social Security. Social Security has some issues, too, but it will never account for more than a tiny portion of our GDP. Some of that can be fixed with just tweaks around the edges (like increasing the limit on wages subject to SS tax, paying for disability insurance out of the general revenue instead of SS funds, etc.).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trust fund is an accounting fiction in the same way that &lt;em&gt;all money&lt;/em&gt; is an accounting fiction. Technically, the U.S. could revalue and declare meaningless all currency in an instant. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Money itself, as a concept, is basically fictional. Treasury bonds themselves are exactly as fictional.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The question is, in what way is the trust fund &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; fictional than the money or bonds it represents? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The government could, at any time, decide not to pay SS benefits, even if the SS trust fund was held in solid gold in Fort Knox. This has absolutely nothing to do with whether the trust fund is fictional. That&amp;#39;s basically a complete red herring. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reason it&amp;#39;s not fictional in practice is that the government won&amp;#39;t actually do this, and people trust that this is the case. Just like they trust that the money the government issues will continue to have value. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: I believe that cookie and popcorn sales have fundamentally altered the mission and quality of the Scouting programs in America.,"I was a cub scout and boy scout. My parents were both *very* involved with both organizations. My mother volunteered with Girl Scouts to help my sister have the same experience as us boys. Unfortunately, the Girl Scouts seemed to always be gearing up for, in the middle of, or just coming off of cookie sales season. When sales wasn't the focus the corporate side of the organization seemed disinterested in support for camping/hiking trips (adult leaders needed *many* certifications before you could do these activities), or anything that didn't involve pushing for higher numbers during the next sales drive. This wasn't as much the case in Boy Scouts, but it was certainly becoming more a focus than in years past.   It seems to me that what once was a strictly volunteer organization with few full time organizers, has become a very big corporate entity as of the 1980's which has lost focus on child development and put more of it on profiteering off of the very children they are meant to inspire. I want to stress that since 1901 a large corporate structure was essentially unnecessary and then a shift happened as of the 80's which began a massive change in both organizations from the top.   I understand the need for a ""national"" organization to make sure that standards are met, materials such as books and badges are produced, and camps are managed. I just think that was once managed by relatively small numbers of individuals who's salaries were likely below 100K a year have been replaced with a large corporation with salaries that are hidden, but most certainly well above 100K annually, and who enjoy an extra cozy and sheltered status with the government.  I could be wrong. I also believe strongly that there *ARE* good people in the organization (though mostly still at the volunteer level) who most definitely want a good, well rounded, program for the children involved. Maybe a lot has changed since I was in the BSA. I dunno Change my view!  Edit: I see that while sales *do* generate revenues for the overall organization, it can also be used for an education benefit as well as a financial benefit for the troops themselves. I should no more dismiss the experience of selling cookies/popcorn than any other that may be gained through GS or BS. Every troop has their own focus. While mine was centered primarily on outdoor/high adventure skills, there are others who focus on charity/social skills. I still believe that both organizations suffer from a top heavy corporate structure that has questionable necessity and very well paid executives, but that fundraisers *can* be valuable to those who participate as well.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I have never seen any other scout, of either gender or level, sell anything.  And I&amp;#39;ve never heard of a popcorn sale - by anyone - short of going to my local supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I am 53 years old, have lived in 5 states and traveled to 43 states.  I don&amp;#39;t know where you live but I&amp;#39;m betting this is a very local phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I do agree with a lot of points in your post, but there is a huge disconnect between the title of your post, which seems to rant about cookie sales, and the content of your post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a current Girl Scout (yes I know high school is way too old to still be in) I have a couple of things to say-&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cookie selling is staggered across the country which is why is always seems like someone is selling. It may have seemed like your sister always was, but I can tell you she wasn&amp;#39;t because there&amp;#39;s a very limited time frame individual troops are allowed to sell. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However even if there wasn&amp;#39;t cookie selling taught me a lot that emphasize the GS Law and aren&amp;#39;t simply helping money grubbing adults. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will do my best to be&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;honest and fair,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is an ethical way to be a business person and selling taught me that. It taught me that hard work pays off and I would be rewarded fairly for my work. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;friendly and helpful,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In order to be a good salesperson you have to be exactly those two things.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;considerate and caring,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A large component of the selling involved charity work in some way. We had people donate to soldiers or food banks or we  put the money to charitable endeavors. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;courageous and strong,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It may seem silly but at eight years old going up to a complete stranger and asking them to buy cookies is a terrifying thing. But selling taught me I could do it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;and responsible for what I say and do,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you promise to sell a certain amount door to door or give up you saturday to sell at the grocery store, and you don&amp;#39;t, you can directly see the way the troop is let down and it teaches responsibly. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;and to respect myself and others, respect authority,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Self respect can be taught a lot of ways and learning you&amp;#39;re a great sales-girl is certainly one&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;use resources wisely,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When I was in the fifth grade my troop decided we wanted to go to New York. The deal we made with our parents was that we had to cover half the money ourselves through cookie sales. Seeing how our money, that we made was being used taught us how to spend it and and how to budget. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;make the world a better place,&lt;/em&gt; Like I said, a huge portion of the money goes to funding charity work that we do. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;and be a sister to every Girl Scout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An individual troop only keeps 75 cents per box. The rest goes towards production or into a communal fund. It does not go to the CEO like you seem to think. Selling teaches us to share the wealth with all our others troops even of we&amp;#39;re doing the work. Also now that I&amp;#39;m older I help the younger troops sell and learn the same skills that  I did. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV:Clickbait isn't that bad. (Reason Number 2 Will Blow You Away!),"You know what I'm talking about: those articles that pop up on your Facebook, usually shared by your less-evolved friends, listing Life Tips, movie trivia, or other interesting titles. They're called ""clickbait"" because they, while delivering in content, are used to advertise something or bring in site revenue. I've never once had a clickbait article fail to entertain me, so if I'm getting pitched some nobody's memoir in the process, why is it such a bad thing?

"CMV: No is obligated to be attracted to anyone, and people should not be chastised for their preferences.","You see a of this attitude on Tumblr, Facebook, and other social media. Slowly it went from almost exclusively online, to now being more prominent and accepted in the real world.   With this new brand of activism and ""acceptance"" it seems as though if you're not attracted to every single variance of the opposite/same sex, you're labeled an asshole, shallow, transphobic, racist, or any other less than favorable terms. I feel it is wrong to berate, reprimand, or otherwise harass people who take preference in their sexual/romantic partners.   An example of this is the ""fat acceptance"" movement. I'm attracted to petite women. I don't know why, I just am. I have thus far, never been attracted to an obese woman, as I don't find that body type attractive. My attraction/preference isn't anyone else's business other than my own, and no one should be entitled to me.  The same goes for attraction based on any other variable. CMV.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll address parts of your CMV because some parts are correct and some aren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You are correct that it is fine to be not attracted to a certain gender or weight class of people because those characteristics change every single physical feature of that person. The reason why you&amp;#39;ll see many people claim that everyone should be/is bisexual is because they are bisexual and desperately want to be normal. I say this as a bisexual who went through this phase.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But one common theme that we see is people saying that they are not attracted to anyone who is transgender or anyone of a certain race. This is wrong and indicative of a prejudice and I will explain why.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First let&amp;#39;s go over transgender people. If you are not attracted to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; transgender people that is perfectly acceptable. No one is saying that you should be attracted to Bruce Jenner just because he says that he is a woman. He still looks like a man and therefore it is very reasonable for you to not feel any sexual attraction towards him.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But there are plenty of transgender people who are completely passable as their new gender. For example &lt;a href=""http://cavemancircus.com/2010/02/11/test-your-power-of-deduction-man-or-woman/""&gt;there is this fun quiz where you are meant to guess which of the two was once a man&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If someone is to make the blanket statement that they are not attracted to any transgender people then they are likely transphobic. One common argument against this is people saying they want children, but this argument falls apart when you question whether or not they would date a women who can&amp;#39;t have children due to a medical issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s inherently wrong to have &amp;quot;preferences&amp;quot; but I think it&amp;#39;s worth examining whether some of those preference are in fact stemmed in prejudice. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like I&amp;#39;d imagine that announcing that you&amp;#39;d never date e.g. a black person is quite highly correlated with anti-black prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Firstly, there&amp;#39;s the fact you&amp;#39;re announcing it (rather than just quietly adhering to it) which raises a red flag to people on the internet (who would never have had a chance to criticise that aspect of you otherwise). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It raises another red flag to be so categorical about it (you&amp;#39;re not just saying you have a mild preference, like you usually prefer blondes to brunettes, it&amp;#39;s literally a deal-breaker for the person to be black?)    &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And finally, even if it seems to you to just be a matter of taste in looks, it&amp;#39;s quite possible you&amp;#39;re harboring some subconscious prejudice that is influencing your preferences. Like maybe you associate black women with being loud and aggressive, and you don&amp;#39;t like loud and aggressive women, so when looking at a black woman you might subsconciously lower her rating a bit based on this stereotype.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not quite the same for weight, especially as it can have genuine health issues, but I&amp;#39;d still want to scrutinise someone who claimed they could never be attracted to an overweight woman. There are a lot of good reasons but I&amp;#39;d still imagine there&amp;#39;s a pretty decent correlation between &lt;em&gt;expressing&lt;/em&gt; that opinion and subscribing to &lt;a href=""/r/fatpeoplehate""&gt;/r/fatpeoplehate&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I believe the criticism of Twilight is just thinly veiled misogynysm CMV,The level of derision heaped on Twilight has little to do with the actual quality of the films or books and a lot to do with men not being able to cope with the fact that there is a successful franchise aimed at women. Worse still at young women. And don't get us started on Twilight moms. Lets slag them off in the queue for Man of Steel or Iron Man 3.  Worse still is the patronising argument that Twilight is a bad influence on young women. This no doubt made by the same people who would have a spasm if you suggested that Video games have a deleterious affect on young men. Young women are quite capable of recognising the distinction between fact and fiction.  I can offer no evidence as this is my opinion but what set me thinking was [this](http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/24/twilight-breaking-dawn-teenage-girls) piece in The Guardian.  Edit: View changed,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that were true, we would expect similar levels of vitriol aimed at other media aimed at girls and women wouldn&amp;#39;t we? And yet we don&amp;#39;t see that level of criticism aimed at things like My Little Pony, which has a very vocal &amp;#39;brony&amp;#39; community that watches it. And Legend of Korra, which stars a teenage girl and is set in a world that builds upon the one created in TLA, which was also filled with well written and developed female characters. Same with Orange is the New Black, which is almost entirely about women. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If it was chiefly misogyny that was causing the hate for twilight, we would naturally assume that the misogyny fueling criticism of twilight would result in criticism of those other fictions. And it&amp;#39;s because the examples I listed are all well written. Twilight is hated because it&amp;#39;s poorly written and has had far too much success given how poorly written it is. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The article you linked mentions movies that, in her opinion, are similarly bad with the target genders reversed like Cowboys and Aliens, but I don&amp;#39;t think those are comparable. CnA for example, didn&amp;#39;t do that well in theaters and was not the huge phenomenon that Twilight was, and while the premise was silly, the execution of the premise wasn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bad. Meanwhile, Twilight started with a premise that could have worked, but it had terrible writing. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not misogyny, it&amp;#39;s that the more successful something is, the more intense the criticism of it will be if it&amp;#39;s generally perceived to be stupid. Look at Cars and Car 2 by Pixar. Most people agree that they&amp;#39;re some of Pixar&amp;#39;s worst movies. (They&amp;#39;re not terrible - they&amp;#39;re just not as good) They get a disproportional amount of criticism though, because despite being some viewed as the worse in Pixar&amp;#39;s selection, they are some of the most profitable, and people hate that. So they gets more criticism than they might deserve. Misogyny doesn&amp;#39;t even factor in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a woman, and I&amp;#39;m very critical of Twilight because the writing is horrible.  In addition to the bad writing, it&amp;#39;s a thinly-veiled pro-life parable that encourages young women to be weak and submissive. In comparison, The Hunger Games is well written and features a strong female character. You don&amp;#39;t see nearly as much vitriol directed at this series, in spite of the fact that they are aimed at similar audiences.  I attribute this to the fact that the writing is much better and the lead is powerful, talented, and smart all on her own. She isn&amp;#39;t reliant upon a man to provide her with self worth. She&amp;#39;s not chasing the men around, begging for their affection, and trying to kill herself because she is rebuffed. She&amp;#39;s a self-assured badass.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When you say that young women are able to tell fact from fiction, I agree. This is not the problem with Twilight. The problem is that it acts as an agent of socialization. Young women internalize the idea that loving someone means being submissive, devoted to the point of self-destruction. It&amp;#39;s a dangerous concept for young women to internalize, just as it&amp;#39;s dangerous for young men to think it&amp;#39;s okay to treat women as sex objects without feelings. As a society, we discourage our young people from viewing certain behaviors in a positive light through negative sanctions, and I think that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening here.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I also hated The Da Vinci code because the writing was atrocious. Same with 50 shades of gray. There is a lot of bad prose out there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: I believe we/media should not censor ourselves when discussing issues dealing with racial slurs.,"In the aftermath of the SAE video, I've noticed a lot media outlets use the phrase ""n-word"". Most everything I read on the topic was self-censored, and very few used the word in it's entirety.  I get it, it's an ugly, hate-filled word, and as a white person, there's nothing I can really experience that would be similar.   I have no love for the actual word. Racial slurs sicken me. However, I think we do ourselves a disservice by tiptoeing around the word. In the context of discourse, is it not intellectually insulting?  Reddit, CMV, please.    Edit: thanks for the feedback. I'm not sure my mind has been changed, but I definitely don't know which statement I agree with now. You guys rock.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you be specific about the disservice being done when the word is censored?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And intellectually insulting to whom? It isn&amp;#39;t like anyone is confused as to what word we&amp;#39;re talking about. I mean, shucks it&amp;#39;s kind of telling that you yourself failed to use the word once in your entire post - and here I am not using it and yet we both know what we&amp;#39;re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Using the slur adds nothing to the discussion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmmm... the media also bleeps out uses of other common swear words. I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s anything intellectually dishonest about it, it&amp;#39;s just that they believe (and I think rightly) that significant numbers of their viewers are offended by hearing that word, and don&amp;#39;t see any particular reason to subject them to it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fuck&amp;quot; is treated basically exactly the same.

I believe that pizza is a kind of sandwich. CMV.,"I think of sandwich as having many vestigial definitions that don't matter very much but nonetheless apply. The following things are in the blanket category of ""sandwich."" Sandwiches are handheld foods featuring some kind of bread and filling. If an open-faced sandwich is still a sandwich, then how is a pizza dough covered in sauce and cheese not also a sandwich?   * taco * pizza * gyro * wrap * some burritos (unless they can no longer be picked up prior to being served) * hot dog on buns.  My girlfriend is disgusted by this opinion but that's just how I see the world.   EDIT: I can now admit I was wrong. Pizzas, tacos, and burritos are not sandwiches. The view-changing effect was the cumulative work of many commenters here. I still belive that a hot dog on a bun is a sandwich and I also still think a ""wrap"" is often a sandwich because they usually contain the same ingredients as ""sandwiches"" and they're often sold at the same restaurants. I've given deltas to several commenters. Thank you very much. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#39;d only call stuff-between-two-pieces-of-bread a sandwich without any qualifiers.  I&amp;#39;d agree that a gyro or hot dog is a type of sandwich, but if someone asked me what I was eating and I was having a gyro, I wouldn&amp;#39;t answer &amp;quot;sandwich&amp;quot;.  The other issue I have with that list is hard-shell tacos.  I really don&amp;#39;t think a hard shell counts as &amp;quot;bread&amp;quot;.  I mean, it&amp;#39;s not bread-y at all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But a pizza is wildly different.  The main difference is that you put the stuff on, then bake the bread.  The bread part of the pizza never exists independently of the pizza itself.  You&amp;#39;re not taking bread and putting stuff on it like a sandwich.  You have a pizza (just uncooked) before the bread has even been made.  That&amp;#39;s the key point--you say it &amp;quot;features some kind of bread and filling&amp;quot;.  But pizza dough covered in sauce and cheese isn&amp;#39;t bread, it&amp;#39;s dough.  The sandwiching happens before the bread is made, which makes it a totally separate thing.  Sandwiches are when you put some stuff on bread, not when you put some stuff on dough which is then made into bread.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Additionally, you called the stuff that goes on the sandwich &amp;quot;filling&amp;quot;.  I agree.  Usually, in a sandwich, the bread holds or contains the rest of the sandwich, either by bracketing it (a roll), surrounding it (a wrap), or supporting it (an open-faced sandwich).  While pizza is close to the third, I don&amp;#39;t think that it&amp;#39;s really accurate to say that the bread supports the cheese and sauce--they&amp;#39;re all baked together into one unit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;tl;dr sandwiches are where you put stuff on bread.  but in a pizza, the stuff is put on dough and baked with it, which is unlike how a sandwich is made.  also, the cheese and sauce isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;filling&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has actually been tried in court in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.stuartkaplow.com/library3.cfm?article_id=131""&gt;In his ruling, Worcester Superior Court Judge Jeffrey A.

"I believe in equal-opportunity meritocracy, but I also think winners use their power to cheat and lock in advantages. The solution is to reset opportunity by seizing and redistributing wealth every 50 years so the winners have to keep proving themselves. CMV","Cheating methods include: test prep, prep schools, legacy admissions, gifts to schools, inheritance, nepotism, racism. Let's put a stop to all this so we live up to the ideal of equal opportunity.   I know how disruptive a 50 year reset would be, but I think if the winners really deserve their status they can handle it. They will naturally rise to the top after each reset and so much room will be made for disruptive innovation that any society that does this will soar ahead of those that don’t.   Note that I don't want to dismantle firms, just redistribute ownership.  I can imagine how hard this would be to implement, especially if it could not be done globally, but I think it’s a worthwhile goal because everyone needs to feel they live in a true meritocracy instead of a corrupt system. Maybe a constitutional convention would make it happen?  Forms of wealth to redistribute continuously over time: education, food, health care, &amp; traditional public goods like water, roads, justice, etc. Forms of wealth to seize and redistribute every 50 years: money, land, valuable contracts, stocks, bonds, futures, derivatives, and other financial instruments.   Forms of wealth that can’t be redistributed: innate intelligence, sociability, creativity, drive. These are the things winners should be judged on.   It takes a little communism to keep capitalism working... unless I'm wrong.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t work because of game theory. There&amp;#39;s a famous game called the Prisoner&amp;#39;s Dilemma (which reflects lots of real-world situations), in which you have two people. Each person benefits from being cooperated with, the benefit from not cooperating with the other person, and both people benefit more from both cooperating than from both not cooperating.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In order for people to cooperate when they can&amp;#39;t make binding agreements, they have to have the reason of trying to get their partner to cooperate in a future iteration of the game. There&amp;#39;s a proof of this; the best way to play the Prisoner&amp;#39;s Dilemma is to start by cooperating, and then do whatever your partner did last time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, this breaks down if you know exactly how long the game is going to run. In the final iteration, neither person has any incentive to cooperate (since there are no more future iterations to influence), so they will both not cooperate. Since this outcome can&amp;#39;t be changed, there&amp;#39;s no reason to cooperate in the next-to-last round, therefore there&amp;#39;s no reason to cooperate in the third-to-last, and so on all the way back to the first round.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To avoid that problem, you need to make the resets based on something random, and make them happen suddenly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could work only if you could keep the reset a secret. If it &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; a secret you&amp;#39;ve massively, catastrophically, distorted economic incentives. Lets list a few examples:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, a few years or less before the reset all the most productive members of society &lt;em&gt;stop working&lt;/em&gt;. Why? Because they&amp;#39;ve saved enough to live off of the next few years and there is zero reason for them to work for money they&amp;#39;ll just have to give up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time the demands for a certain class of goods go through the roof: any thing that is consumed in the short term but has long term dividends. &lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt; wants to go to school, get training, or go on vacation. &lt;em&gt;No one&lt;/em&gt; wants to teach classes, do training or serve people on vacation. This is basically a mega great-depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have an idea for a new technology that could change the world? Is it something you could reasonably expect to profit from for more than the next decade and that no one is likely to beat you to? Then keep it a secret until just after the reset. No major technological innovations for the years leading up to the reset will nicely contribute to the biggest recession the world has even seen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmer? In normal times you&amp;#39;ve been rotating crops to keep from over farming. Logger? Are you planting new trees to replace what you&amp;#39;re growing down? Have you been keeping that stream clear for your grandchildren to enjoy? Screw it: the land is about to be someone else&amp;#39;s: time to make a quick buck by using it as a chemical waste dump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want a loan or capital of any kind to start a business? I can&amp;#39;t imagine why since you&amp;#39;ll lose everything you make. But even if you did: you won&amp;#39;t be able to get it. No one is going to loan you money they won&amp;#39;t get back. No one is going to stay invested in your company when they can spend the dough on caviar and hookers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, add one more thing: this proposal is &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; politically feasible than making all hiring and admissions blind. I don&amp;#39;t think getting rid of inheritance is a good idea (similar screwing with incentives): but it is certainly easier than your plan. And doing things like that doesn&amp;#39;t create these perverse incentives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
I believe the average young american has a very very dim future ahead of them CMV,"There is essentially no issue currently facing America that is not being dealt with in nearly the worst possible way. Our education is declining in quality and increasing in cost, infrastructure is crumbling, poverty is creeping upwards, the middle class is evaporating into corporate serfdom,  our policies are in many cases directly written by lobbyists working for a super-national multibillionare clique. Disgustingly highly levels of hereditary economy inequality are being presented as virtuous and sacred aspects of our culture, while the idea of government ""by the people, for the people, and of the people""  or ""all human beings are created equal"" would likely be shot down as treasonous leftism if they were spoken aloud. Our concept of freedom is gradually being substituted for an animalistic thrill of the destruction of cultural outsiders, and as a result, dogmatic religious followers are attempting to re-write our social contract to conform to their anti-tolerance prejudices and ideals of systematic discrimination.   What little resources we do have at the government level are being spent on medical care for a hypocritical population of senior citizens who refuse to see similar privileges extended to the young as evidenced by our sloppy abortion of an attempt at universal healthcare (the only sort of abortion the militant fundamentalists and misogynists will allow), and an ever expanding bloated national security apparatus which has no credible external enemies (Despite all attempts to manufacture them), and as evidenced by the saga of Snowden and Manning, is now being turned against its own population with callous and sociopathic disregard for their rights and well being.   The situation is not likely to improve. The citizens united decision has essentially legalized the bribery of congressional members, and shameless gerrymandering and policies of local disenfranchisement, combined with duvergers law and out two party system have created a catch-22 by which electoral reform has to exist in order for electoral reform to be enacted, thanks to the ability of the elite to rig the system in their favor, so real reform would require massive civil demonstrations or violent revolution, the later of which would probably just make things worse anyways, and both of which will likely not happen until irreversibly damage has been done to our society thanks to the materialistic complacency of our citizens. And, finally, I'm too proud to just run away to a country in northwestern Europe, because I can't stand to spend the rest of my life being looked down upon as the Refugee outsider born of a failed culture and state. So, my options here, are, best case unlikely scenario, I weasel my way into the apparatus of the elite (Which will be the only middle class left here soon), if not the elite itself (no chance of that happening), and live my life in physical comfort but emotionally paranoid and unfulfilled. Worst case, I'm just crushed, slowly or rapidly, under their heel, either murdered or exploited for a few decades before I finally keel over and am discarded.  I don't like feeling this way. A lot of people on reddit seem to, but not me. I was told, and not just by my parents who have no choice, that I had potential, and have worked to live up to it. I don't want to talk at length about it to avoid sounding like a boastful jackass but when I was young and naive it seemed like I had every empirical reason to expect things to turn out great. So, wont you please CMV?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have several thoughts&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) I think the biggest problem in America is we think we are inherently amazing, but the truth is, we were the only large industrialized nation that didn&amp;#39;t get all our factories blow up in ww2.  We&amp;#39;re still the world super power but won&amp;#39;t be forever.  There is no reason to think we should have the best [insert anything here] in the world, except for arrogance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) Just because we don&amp;#39;t and won&amp;#39;t have the best education in the world doesn&amp;#39;t mean the future is dim.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) I hear the phrase &amp;quot;infrastructure is crumbling&amp;quot; pretty often, but when is the last time you went on a road trip and hit a pot hole that destroyed your car?  When is the last time you got sick from drinking tap water? when was the last time it took 8 hours for the police to show up at your house?  Hell when was the last time you had to call the police.  Unless you live in Detroit, you&amp;#39;re probably doing okay.  And if you do live in Detroit, that&amp;#39;s one industry that got hammered and took a single city down.  I travel all over the country for my job and am never concerned about the roads, water, electricity, phone lines, or other infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4) The media makes things sound worse then they are because that attracts viewers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;5) The domination that corporations have over our lives today is nothing compared to big business in the early 1900s and late 1800s.  Adjusted for inflation John D. Rockefeller is the wealthiest american who ever lived.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;6) military spending as a percent of GDP is not high.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;7) What&amp;#39;s good in our world? technology.  Cell phones, access to information, health care, improving manufacturing and distribution efficiency (i.e. lower cost for good). even if we make organizational mistakes.  No matter what mistakes we make regarding government or policies technology will continue to raise the quality of life around the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;#39;s dim if you compare it to an idealized world where everyone is happy and healthy and nothing bad ever happens. But if you look at it relativist stand point, the average American is in a great position.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still opportunity for people, no matter how difficult to attain. Compared to what people experience in an actual failed state, American troubles are nothing. We have clean water running in our taps. We have roads. We have electricity on a regular basis. We have access to the internet. All of these things are enormous luxuries for the vast majority of people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, even the poorest person in America is better off than the average person in India. In India, 40% of the population (440 million people) live on less than $1.25/day. 70% (770 million people) live on less than $2/day. &lt;a href=""http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/traveler-magazine/photo-contest/2012/entries/131533/view/""&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; photo sticks out to me, not because it is unique, but because it looks so typical. Everywhere in India, even the nicest suburbs of New Delhi, looks like that. There is garbage everywhere. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, poverty in America-real poverty that the 46 million people at the bottom of the socioeconomic pyramid experience-is tough too. But the sheer numbers don&amp;#39;t compare to what people in India experience on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I challenge you to spend 1 month in a developing country, even a relatively wealthy one like Mexico, and see if you still feel the same way about the so called failures of the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: Explaining causation is not ""blaming"" the victim, and it's a worthwhile endeavor.","I've been thinking about this issue for a while. The sentence in the title is an over-simplification of the view, but I'll elaborate more here. Technically it's a two-part view: 1) Explaining causation is not ""blaming"" the victim. 2) Explaining causation is a worthwhile endeavor.  I'd be happy to have either view changed - though if view 1 is changed, I'd probably change my mind on view 2. (It'll be easier to change my mind, in other words, about view 2 than view 1 – I’m not certain that it’s a worthwhile endeavor.)  Let me start off by saying that I understand the issues with victim blaming. There's an unfortunate tendency that I’ve noticed – particularly on the Internet, but occasionally in person as well – to blame the victims of terrible situations. We’re seeing it with responses to the police murders of black citizens (people trying to find a reason why the person was shot), and we see it with victims of rape (people say: you shouldn’t have been so drunk, or you shouldn’t have been in that area of town). There are all sorts of possible explanations as to why victim blaming occurs; one of the most convincing to me is that these occurrences cause a sort of cognitive dissonance in our minds where bad things happen to people who don’t deserve it. We like to think of our world as “just” in some way, so we come up with reasons why these people “Deserved” what they got. People rarely go so far as to say a woman “deserved” to be raped, but there’s a certain amount of “otherization” and lack of empathy that goes on – a sense that “well, that wouldn’t have happened to me, because I would’ve been more careful”. Additionally, it blames the victim for something that you should be blaming the perpetrator for. And that’s all bad.  On the other hand, it remains the case that the world is not a just place. Yes, we can work towards justice; we can work towards eliminating racism – overt or structural – and we can work towards a society in which women feel safer. And we absolutely should. In the meantime, however, it is important to understand lines of causation. I’m not going with a very complicated definition of causation here: basically a model in which two events or situations occur – A and B – and one event (B) would not have occurred the other (A) had not occurred. A caused B. (I’m aware there are logical or philosophical arguments against this model, but that’s not the view I’m trying to have changed; if you can make a compelling argument about the relevant views using those points, go ahead.)  The case I often think of concerns myself and friends of mine. I live in a large city. It is safe, for the most part, but there are certain areas that you shouldn’t walk in at night, because you might get mugged. Both myself and a friend of mine have been mugged while walking through these areas. The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged. So we don’t walk through those areas at night anymore. It’s still possible that we’ll get mugged elsewhere, but in my mind, we’ve decreased our chances, which is a good thing. We didn’t deserve to get mugged before, but changing our behavior prevented us from getting mugged again.  Thus, explaining causation is not justification. It’s simply understanding the chain of events that led to another event.  Finally, my second view is that it’s a worthwhile endeavor. As I said, we avoid those dangerous areas at night now, and I feel we’ve decreased our chances of getting mugged. We understood the causation behind a negative situation, and we changed our behavior accordingly. Ideally, all areas would be safe to walk in, but they’re not, so we don’t walk in the unsafe areas anymore. Yes, this has mildly restricted our behavior – but it’s worth it to us, so that we don’t get mugged.   I understood these are hairy issues, and maybe there’s a fine line between causation and justification. CMV.  EDIT: Fixed a sentence.   EDIT 2: Thank you - these have been really interesting and illuminating discussions, and forced me to reconsider the nuances of my view. I plan to give out more Deltas, because the latter part of my view has been changed somewhat. I don't think it's always a ""worthwhile endeavor"" - especially in cases of sexual assault, there's an unfortunate tendency of victims to blame themselves, and ""explaining causation"" to them doesn't really serve any purpose other than to increase unnecessary and unjustified guilt on their part. Many of these situations demand care and compassion.   As far as ""part 1"" of my view goes, I still stand by my original statement. Granted, people have pointed out inconsistencies in the term ""causation"" - but as I said, I'm not really trying to have a discussion about causation as a concept. I understand that it's very complex, and of course many factors go into a certain outcome. I am well aware of probabilistic models of events/outcomes; my point was never to say that ""avoid certain areas means you won't get mugged"", or something like that. It concerned a marginal decrease of risk - a change in probability. Furthermore, the point itself was actually that ""explaining causation is not victim blaming"", and this view has not been addressed sufficiently. I've changed my view to the point that I don't think ""explaining causation"" is always the appropriate response (particularly in traumatic cases like sexual assault). I do still think it's often important to explain causation before the fact, as some users have suggested as an alternative, simply to give people a good idea of what precautions they might want to take. Most specifically, no one has really addressed this notion of causation vs. justification. One person has said they're the same thing, but not really offered an explanation for that.   At any rate, I've enjoyed reading the responses so far; I'm aware this is a sensitive issue, and I'm glad discussions have remained pretty civil.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Mary gets mugged. You response is: &amp;quot;Well why was she walking through that street at night? That&amp;#39;s stupid, she should have known she would get mugged.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The correct response is: &amp;quot;Well, that&amp;#39;s unfortunate. That&amp;#39;s a really unsafe area. The news/the police/the community should do more to ensure peoples awareness and safety in that area.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Do you see the difference? One is victim blaming. The other is having a mature discussion regarding the crime. It begins a helpful discussion on the realities of the situation and ways to improve the situation. It acknowledges your point - that there are dangers in the world that people can work to avoid - without dismissing the actual crime down to the victim&amp;#39;s decisions. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first just says it&amp;#39;s all Mary&amp;#39;s fault. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a massive difference. The first one should never be discussed outside of the victim, the police, and family. What if Mary was from out of town and didn&amp;#39;t know the area was unsafe? What if Mary got lost? What if Mary got in a fight with her boyfriend and was kicked out of the car there? Are all of these not perfectly understandable reasons why Mary would be at that specific location at that time of night? How are you in any specific way able to judge the situation and draw those particular conclusions?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Does the second response not completely cover both your requirements? Explaining the causation of the crime and helping people through doing so (worthwhile)? Does it not do both of those &lt;em&gt;in a better way&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;assumed&lt;/em&gt; that the first response does accomplishes these goals, but in fact it doesn&amp;#39;t. It&amp;#39;s a psychological knee-jerk response. You hit the nail on the head here, you just miss the connection between the two. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The world is not a just place, but people want it to be and subconsciously try to make it feel that way. By saying things like &amp;quot;she shouldn&amp;#39;t have been there&amp;quot; we are exactly saying &amp;quot;This would never happen to me because I would never do that&amp;quot; and therefore make yourself feel better by justifying the issue and therefore the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When we do that, we dismiss the actual problem. We don&amp;#39;t talk about the safety of the street and how to improve it, we don&amp;#39;t talk about mental illness improvements and education and lowering poverty so we make the world a better place. We talk about Mary. And how stupid she was.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Things got confusing here I think, so I want to clarify a couple things.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;1. The point of all these examples was this: &amp;quot;Causation&amp;quot; can be discussed with or without victim blaming, and doing it with victim blaming does no one any good. These discussions typically do include victim blaming because it&amp;#39;s human nature to victim blame, and discussing the topic without victim blaming is actually challenging.&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;2. How does this relate to OP&amp;#39;s topic: Discussing causation is completely unrelated to victims at all. If you are discussing a specific victim, you&amp;#39;re probably victim blaming, and this is what tends to happen the most. If you&amp;#39;re discussing the situation that happened, you&amp;#39;re discussing causation.&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;3. I am not suggesting people not take personal responsibility for their safety.  It all falls down to the reasonableness of actions that we require from others. It&amp;#39;s perfectly reasonable to require someone to lock their door. It&amp;#39;s not reasonable to expect them to completely board up their house.&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;4. I wasn&amp;#39;t trying to ignite a discussion on when we should or should not victim blame or where lines of personality responsibility are drawn and I don&amp;#39;t feel like that thread is relevant to the topic. I was discussing only the conversation that occurs after there has been a crime.&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would say that the difficulty here is in assigning &amp;quot;causal factors&amp;quot; accurately. Let&amp;#39;s take your example: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The causation is: if we hadn’t been walking through those areas, we wouldn’t have gotten mugged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Actually, it would have also prevented your being mugged had you left 10 minutes later. It further likely would have prevented your mugging had one of you been armed. If the mugger&amp;#39;s spouse had a fight with them before they left the house to mug you, and this delayed them so you passed before they did, it would have prevented your mugging. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your being mugged is a &lt;em&gt;statistical&lt;/em&gt; outcome, not attributable to any one behavior on your part. In this case, the root cause is exactly and only the mugger choosing to mug you. There&amp;#39;s no other causal factor that would have actually &lt;em&gt;prevented&lt;/em&gt; the situation, only changed the probabilities, and you can&amp;#39;t really trust probabilities to guide specific behavior in specific situations. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Absolute &amp;quot;causation&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t a helpful concept in cases like this. The causal factors of one individual trial of a statistical experiment aren&amp;#39;t very important. The response to a statistical problem is not to change behavior on individual trials of the experiment, it&amp;#39;s to address the root cause of the statistical problem. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#39;t, nor should we, do everything in our power to reduce all possibility of danger. Surely you can see the reductio ad absurdum here. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We have to weigh the effectiveness of our strategies against the costs and benefits. If avoiding one part of town reduces your risk by (let&amp;#39;s convert everything to dollars here for ease of calculation) $0.10, but it costs you $0.50 in inconvenience, exercise of your rights, enjoyment of life, and every other factor (most of which are very hard to calculate) then you &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; not avoid that part of town, even if it led to your being mugged.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not necessarily &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; to point out these statistical factors in order to help people make return-on-investment calculations, if that&amp;#39;s your real goal. It&amp;#39;s not too helpful, because people don&amp;#39;t really have enough information, nor training in statistical theory, to apply that information. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s really very hard to come up with true valuations of these factors. Don&amp;#39;t make the mistake of thinking that because it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;obvious to you&amp;quot; that a part of town is dangerous that it is worthwhile to tell someone they should avoid that part of town. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you want to tell people in general that traveling in that part of town has a 0.01% chance of resulting in their being mugged and robbed of their pocket change (let&amp;#39;s say the average is $100, with another $900 in lost peace of mind), by all means let them know that the expected cost of that behavior is $0.10, so that they can decide if it&amp;#39;s worth that cost to them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s about accurate for the most dangerous parts of any town, and for actual losses typically incurred. If you exaggerate the danger, you&amp;#39;re not doing anyone any favors, and are actually doing them harm, statistically.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When you talk to an actual &lt;em&gt;victim&lt;/em&gt; about these things, realize that they &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; probably have a vastly inflated opinion about the risks of their behavior, because they have suffered an unlikely outcome in that regard. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Almost in every case, if you&amp;#39;re speaking to a &lt;em&gt;victim&lt;/em&gt;, it would be more accurate to &lt;em&gt;downplay&lt;/em&gt; the risks that they took, if your goal is to actually statistically help them. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If someone is in a plane crash and is injured, your telling them that riding planes is dangerous is true as far as it goes... it&amp;#39;s just a lot less dangerous than driving, which is what they&amp;#39;re likely to do instead. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Societally speaking, we have to be very careful what we warn people about, because everyone&amp;#39;s mileage varies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I believe that motive shouldn't be taken into account in murder trials. CMV,"I've been watching the news lately, and there have been a lot of murder trials where the amount of leeway given to judges in terms of sentencing. For example, in [a local case in Minneapolis](http://www.startribune.com/local/east/233333381.html), he was found guilty of ""second degree unintentional murder.""  Minnesota law defines second-degree unintentional murder as an act causing the death of “a human being, without intent to effect the death of any person, while committing or attempting to commit a felony offense other than criminal sexual conduct in the first or second degree with force or violence or a drive-by shooting …”  I think this is rediculous. If someone kills someone by beating them to death ""without meaning to"", what difference does it make? They killed someone, and I don't think that there should be a difference whether it was premeditated to kill a specific person, if you plan to kill someone but not a specific person (gang violence), or you kill someone on a spur of the moment. Barring extenuating circumstances like self defense, I believe that if you murder someone, motives shouldn't be taken into account even if you ""accidentally"" beat someone to death. CMV.  Edit: I apologize for this but I had a bunch of stuff come up an hour after I posted this so I couldn't continue arguments. However, I've been checking in over the last day, and there have been some fantastic arguments on here, and while I still think that in many cases like I gave of ""second degree unintentional homicide"" are pretty ridiculous, there has to be a line drawn somewhere in which (as was pointed out to me by /u/uniptf where motive is pretty irrelevant in a trial, but intent is what is taken into consideration) intent is taken into consideration. Intent should be taken into account to a point. I still have a lot of thinking to do before I finally decide on where that line is drawn.  I have to also have to say that while I may think that self-defense isn't murder, if you completely disregard intent, then it is a flawed argument on my part. As many of you have pointed out, the different degrees of the crime are ways of making sure that those who murdered someone get at least some sort of justice. I also have to thank /u/learhpa for pointing out that in order for something to be considered a crime, you have to have a ""criminal intent"" towards this.   I'm going to go through everyone's arguments and respond/award deltas for those who gave me a different perspective and at least changed part of my viewpoint on this.   Last of all, I just have to say I really enjoy this sub. It's one of the few places on reddit where there are actual civil discussions on things, and I really appreciate those who took the time to respond. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason these gradations are there is that it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; to prove intent. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The example you give is a decent one, but we have a notion of &amp;quot;manslaughter&amp;quot; for a reason. Someone that never intended even to injure someone but kills them (e.g. accidentally crashing into someone and killing them) is less of a danger to society than someone that intends to do it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say a person hits someone with their car, and there&amp;#39;s some reason to suspect that they did it intentionally. If you can prove it, great, but what if you can&amp;#39;t? Should they get off scot-free because it was an &amp;quot;accident&amp;quot;? No, and it&amp;#39;s a hell of a lot easier to prove that they &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; kill someone than it is to prove they intended to. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That said, a major purpose of the justice system in the U.S. does seem to be about retribution. If you believe that justice is only served if the perpetrator suffers as much as the victim, then I suppose your view might make sense. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many people, however, believe that the punishment is related to how dangerous the criminal is, rather than how much the victim is damaged. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you believe that the purpose of prison is to rehabilitate a criminal, serve as a deterrent to others, and to keep the criminal away from society for a time so they can&amp;#39;t commit another crime, then &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; absolutely has to be considered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a general principle of American law that, in most cases, you must have a criminal intent in order to be found guilty of a crime.  The concept is referred to as &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea""&gt;mens rea&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;#39;s one of the fundamental premises of American criminal law.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reason for this distinction is that punishment should be tied to culpability. For example, if I&amp;#39;m a construction worker, and due to an accident while working on scaffolding something falls and kills someone below me, I&amp;#39;m &lt;em&gt;less culpable&lt;/em&gt; than if I&amp;#39;d deliberately thrown something off of the scaffolding without caring whether it hit someone or not, and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; would be &lt;em&gt;less culpable&lt;/em&gt; than deliberately dropping a hammer on someone intending it to hit them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: The terms ""property"", ""ownership"" and ""stealing"", when used to describe information , are meaningless","By information, I mean things like software, music, movies, photographs or anything that can be replicated infinitely.  Don't get me wrong, I do believe in laws that encourage creativity. I believe that an individual who creates something, like a song or an algorithm or a painting, deserves to be credited and paid if her/his work profits someone.   I also believe in laws for privacy. If you keep some information in a private storage and some one replicates it without authorization, it is a crime.  But photographs, unlike a loaf of rye bread, cannot be ""stolen"". Call it a different kind of crime, maybe ""pirating"" (we do not have as many swashbuckling seafarers around, so that word is up for grabs)? This is mere semantics, so it is not a big deal.  However, patents and copyright are not ""property"" in the sense that cars are. They are simply documentation describing an idea and ascribing credit. The creator understandably is granted the right to control the use of the idea for a time.  I find it hard to understand what is meant by ""selling"" a patent or a copyright. That the original patent holder authored the idea is a fact, which cannot be changed. What does it mean for them to sell their rights to the idea away? If a third party allegedly buys these rights, why should society feel compelled to credit and compensate them for its use?  I think that we have become so used to thinking about legality in terms of ""possession"", that we apply such a model even to things that don't quite fit. Treating information as property creates dangerous entities like patent trolls, which do not create anything but merely buy and sell information for profit.  As a person whose living depends on creating content in the form of information, does my view hurt my self interests? CMV if possible. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Property doesn&amp;#39;t exist, in the same way that trees, dogs, and reddit exists. Property is just a shared agreement among people that a certain person (or group of people) &amp;#39;owns&amp;#39; some certain object, and that the relationship of ownership means the person can choose what to do with said object, where it is, deny it to others, etc., and can transfer that ownership to another person.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Property is just a word, and the meaning of that word is decided by society. In the past, the possible objects to call &amp;quot;Property&amp;quot; were actual physical objects, and so society codified certain ethics based around the owning of these objects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, if you want to argue that the term &amp;#39;property&amp;#39; is meaningless when applied to human-created information, you have to demonstrate that not only is the label meaningless for you, but that it&amp;#39;s actually meaningless for everyone. i.e., it&amp;#39;s only meaningless if everyone already agreed that it was meaningless, in which case we wouldn&amp;#39;t be having this conversation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many members of society currently do think of information as a thing that the creator has a moral right to, a right to limit others from using it, to exploit it commercially, and to transfer it. They conceive of this created information in the same way they do Property, and use that metaphor to describe the relationship between creator and information.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As long as these people exist and are the majority of society, then information is Property, because they say it is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I do not believe complaining about advertisements is justified when free content is provided. CMV,"All the time I see people complain about ads, whether it be pre-rolls, banners, or popups. To me, this is completely unjustified since you are essentially receiving a FREE service and it is completely unjustified to complain about a little clutter or the fact that you have to wait 5 seconds before you watch the content you want to see.  Content creators need to make money, and personally I would rather deal with a few ads than be forced to pay a monthly subscription or have some other kind of pay-per-view service. So, when I see people complaining about ads I find it completely ridiculous. CMV  For what it's worth, I also run AdBlock and have nothing against people who do. However, I mainly do this because I'm worried about viruses. For sites I regularly frequent (webcomics, reddit, etc.) I turn off AdBlock so I can support whoever is providing the service for me.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you also have to see that ads are intrusive and can deteriorate user experience greatly see the &lt;a href=""http://www.escapistmagazine.com/""&gt;Escapeist&lt;/a&gt; which was and possibility still is unusable with out the use of adblock. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Saying that ads are a good source of income isn&amp;#39;t really justified as the most that you can be paid by YouTube is $4 per 1000 view which means your paying $0.012 maximum per view, Which is pretty pathetic. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People who create &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; or more lengthy content see people like Minute Earth, Freddie W and CGP Grey. With both CGP and Minute having to look at subscribers as a viable way to continue to make videos regularly. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I do agree when people complain about intrusive ad&amp;#39;s or ad&amp;#39;s that collect personal information such as Google ad words, because some people are honestly worried about that and believe that their information is their own property. Most of the complaints are about the 2-3 minutes un-skippable ads on YouTube though which is a extreme annoyance for most people, as well as ads which play during a video.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paying attention to complaints is one of the best ways those services have to improve and get more users/viewers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s in their own interest to improve the ad content and delivery in such a way that more users will be &lt;em&gt;willing&lt;/em&gt; to endure them, instead of going to competitors or using ad blockers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20080318/004136567/advertising-is-content-content-is-advertising.shtml""&gt;Advertising is Content&lt;/a&gt;.

I think Language/Journalism/Arts majors require less critical thinking than STEM majors. CMV,One clarification before this begins: I fully understand that people grasp different concepts more intuitively than others. I'm not discussing people's ability to excel in these majors. ,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEM majors are very good with critical thinking skills, indeed. However, when they work on a problem there is one correct answer (usually). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In all of the majors you listed, there is no one correct answer. Creativity is used to find a solution and the &amp;quot;correctness&amp;quot; of it is somewhat subjective. Success in creative fields is essentially based on how many people think your creative solution is the most logical one. So, one could argue that language/journalism/art majors have more critical thinking skills than STEM majors because of the complexity and uniqueness of the problems at hand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would argue that each requires a different sort of critical thinking. It&amp;#39;s not necessarily a less/more dichotomy, but rather different types of reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One obvious example is that language learning requires quite a bit of critical thinking, especially once we get into advanced levels. We have areas such as linguistics, but also of literature. If one had only STEM major critical thinking skills, they would lack the necessary critical thinking skills to analyse language and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The way I see it, subjects such as science and art transfer different types of ideas and reasoning to each other. I thought Feynman&amp;#39;s experience as an artist was intriguing. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Personally, my formal education is in both English and psychology, and I find the reasoning of each complementary. In the end, scientific reasoning has its limits. So much of where science begins is with anecdotal stories, intuition, serendipity, pattern recognition, and so on. The humanities takes a lot of critical thinking, and such critical thinking often leads to hypotheses. After which, as such ideas pass through the scientific process, they often transfer back into the humanities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think the mutually beneficial nature of science fiction and science is a perfect example for what I&amp;#39;m arguing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: I think foreskin is ugly.,"Okay, okay, I know reddit doesn't like this topic, but I just think so. That being said, I am an uncircumcised male. I do not wish to be circumcised, as I completely understand the benefits of the foreskin, they provide more pleasure and protect and keep the head moisturized. But, I think foreskin is ugly. They're wrinkly, and when not cleaned, smell and generate smegma, which frankly is not very attractive. I have no idea how people can put that in their mouths. I know that aesthetic circumcision, especially on a non consenting baby, is incorrect, but circumcised penises can look better.

Myths about smegma are extremely exaggerated in circumcising cultures. This appears to be cultural defensiveness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The skin of the circumcised penis is often wrinklier unless the surgery made the skin very tight. The skin of the unmodified penis can be moved back to achieve a very similar aesthetic. For most penises, the skin stays back easily and retracts automatically with erection at least to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, this aesthetic argument shouldn&amp;#39;t have any bearing on whether children&amp;#39;s genitals should be modified without consent or any medical indication. The main argument against non-therapeutic circumcision is that the foreskin is a sensory structure of the penis that contributes a significant part of the feeling of the penis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, I wouldn&amp;#39;t expect it to change your opinion, but it&amp;#39;s worth pointing out that in all cultures with cultural genital cuttings, a synthetic cultural aesthetic standard is applied to the appearance of the genitalia. The cultural idea that the penis should be destructively simplified to an uncomplicated rod is like the idea that the female genitalia should be surgically simplified however those cultures want it to be.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;* I think you might want to see a doctor if you&amp;#39;re getting smegma more quickly.

So how you are currently thinking is mainly due to the indoctrination that you have received (just as it is for me and everyone else).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You talk about dirt and that is a separate argument. Look at the amount of plaque and bacteria that exist in a mouth, especially a dirty one. Why would anyone else ever want to put their mouth on that eh? It really isn&amp;#39;t difficult to wash a penis. Lots of people wash them just before sex.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I personally grew up being indoctrinated that uncircumcised penises were normal and have never even seen a live circumcised one. I think that a foreskin is beautiful. It&amp;#39;s like a little hood, with a penis peeking shyly out. Watching a penis emerge as it becomes erect is really erotic. And when a penis is erect (which it usually is), there isn&amp;#39;t actually anything to see as the skin is stretched out. I find it hard to imagine how a penis without a foreskin even works during sex. I mean - there is no skin!!! Rubbing your head of your penis directly must be horrible!! Or you must have to resort to using lube all the time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You also talk about the scarring, which I have no experience of. and I imagine all this taut, stretched, unnatural looking skin, instead of the velvety, flexible, natural skin, moving over the iron hardness of a penis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve gone and looked at some pictures of circumcised penises, and to me, it looks like they have to just stretch the skin from the scrotum up in order to be able to become erect?  Other than that &amp;quot;stretching&amp;quot; there is very little difference in the look of the two, other than that &lt;a href=""http://media.tumblr.com/4c8b4577bf968e5f234caff7c05027ec/tumblr_inline_ml95kph3Mr1qefpb7.jpg""&gt;the head on a circumcised penis looks so... pachydermal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You should learn to love your penis.

CMV: Tropical governments have disproportionately higher amounts of corruption than non-tropical governments.,"First, I'll state that I have mostly anecdotes to support my view but it is one I completely believe in. Additionally, I have no idea if it's a popular opinion or not. Here goes…  **I believe that nations within the tropics (Cancer to Capricorn) have disproportionately higher government corruption than those found in the more northernly and southernly regions of the earth.**  edit: to u/slf1452's point, I am referring to contemporary governments (lacking data on all civilizations).   That includes nations that are only partially within the tropical region (e.g. Mexico). My opinion is based on the region as a whole, so individual exceptions will not alter my perspective (e.g. Australia).  To CMV, you will need to move me on either of the following points:  1. Demonstrate that there is not more corruption, on average, in the tropics vs. the non-tropics. - OR -  2. Demonstrate that if there is disproportionate corruption, on average, that it is specifically unrelated to the geographical location of the countries.     _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"I believe every healthy American should serve 2 years in the military, starting at age 18. CMV","It's no secret the military has drifted farther and farther away from mainstream America.   * The armed forces attract mostly young poor white males who are religious and conservative. Their views are reinforced by their peers, all just like them. When I explain this, many do not realize that I am not criticizing them for being young, poor, white, male, religious, or conservative.

This there&amp;#39;s one thing America is great at, it&amp;#39;s that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The cannon-fodder days are over. We&amp;#39;re a huge, wealthy country with a boundless high-tech arsenal. We don&amp;#39;t need everyone to join the armed forces. What would the military gain from that other than servicepeople who by and large don&amp;#39;t want to be there? Bad for business. The military would benefit from a more diverse group of people just to bring more skills into the fold, but 18 year olds almost never have any skills anyway.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What are some moral reasons that would be acceptable or unacceptable?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=""http://prhome.defense.gov/rfm/MPP/ACCESSION%20POLICY/PopRep2008/summary/chap5.pdf""&gt;this study from 2008 (PDF WARNING)&lt;/a&gt;, there is not that much difference in the percentage of white individuals in the military than in the USA (72% according to &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States""&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With that point out of the way, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s fair to say that the American Public is &amp;quot;out of touch&amp;quot; with combat and bloodshed. Most of us know that war is a terrible thing that takes away the lives of many of our young members of society. I know no one who glorifies it, and the &amp;quot;armchair generals&amp;quot; you speak of don&amp;#39;t actually affect the armies of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here, my argument would generally go to &amp;quot;we don&amp;#39;t need any more soldiers,&amp;quot; but since you aren&amp;#39;t arguing that, I won&amp;#39;t argue it either.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I personally couldn&amp;#39;t stand the thought of one of my family being forced to go to war and not coming back. My grandfather already paid the ultimate price when my mother was a very young child, and my father had been stationed all over the world before joining the reserves here in Georgia. If you told me that I would have to give up my brothers as well, I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;d do. I &amp;quot;understand the gravity behind going to war&amp;quot; very well, and I haven&amp;#39;t seen a bit of combat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Instead of forced conscription, I think a better avenue would be, as I always think, educating the people about war, which is far less time-consuming and resource-intensive. Which brings me to my next topic: cost. According to that &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States""&gt;Wikipedia Article&lt;/a&gt; I linked earlier, we will have nearly 4 million new 18 year olds next year. Can you imagine the cost and logistics of training 4 million people each year? Military funding would skyrocket, and with the vast majority of individuals simply not continuing through the military past those two years, you would see little to no benefit to our military&amp;#39;s effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: I don't think that one form of Marital Art/Marital Arts Weapons is better than another.,"I have studied Isshin-Ryu Karate for about 8 years now. I am a brown belt (2nd kyu). I have never studied another form of martial arts (henceforth will abbreviate as MA). I have studied other MA weapons, since we have them at the dojo I attend.  A few years ago I started to frequent MA forums. I quickly noticed that people don't like Isshin-Ryu and like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) , and other forms of grappling.   Some reasons they, the people these forums say that BJJ is superior is:  * Most 'street fights' end up on the ground * Isshin-Ryu, as with other 'stand up' MA, don't teach grappling * Issin-Ryu uses 'secret techniques' that are 'too deadly' to use in sparing  M response:  * I wont argue that most 'street fights' end up on the ground * Anything that you can do standing up you can do on the ground * The 'secret techniques' is a result of poor teaching not the style.  My whole view is that all styles of MA have their good and bad sides, but none are inherently better or worse for defending yourself.  To change my view you would have to show that one style is inherently better at defending yourself. If You are confused by something please ask I'll try to clarify.   Edit: I guess my idea is more the individual makes it better not the style itself.  Edit: My view has been changed a lot since I posted this.

Why is &amp;quot;they&amp;#39;re all equal&amp;quot; the default until proven otherwise? I could invent a martial art right now. It&amp;#39;s going to be terrible. I could even intentionally make it terrible. At which point you would then have to accept that &amp;quot;all martial arts are equal except for the one made by cr0kus which is shit&amp;quot;. Given that, why assume that they&amp;#39;re all equal at all? They all have their own history and reasons for existing.

"CMV: ""Hope"" in its broader sense, is just an excuse for inaction.","Many people talk about how they have ""hope"". They hope that their situation improves, or the cling to this idea called ""hope"" with the idea that their problems will take care of themselves. I like to consider myself a man of action and I can't stand when people use this word in this sense, to me, it seems as though people have given up actually making progress toward improving their situation and deciding that it is out of their hands.  I predict that the story of a kid with a disease will come up, and this is a tough one, but realistically, if I was that parent with the sick child, there would be no ""Hope"" there would be action, I would be doing everything I possibly could to help alleviate the child's symptoms, make him more comfortable, or raise money for his cause. To me, hoping is like resting and assuming that something good will come from inaction. So, I personally don't believe that the feeling or emotion of ""Hope"" is beneficial and is just a justification for giving up when used in that sense.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope is a pretty abstract notion, and means a lot of different things to different people. To you, hope means inaction. To me, hope means just the opposite. My life sucks where it is right now, and if I thought that in five years I&amp;#39;d be in the same place I am right now, I would probably kill myself. Instead, I have hope that there is a chance for things to improve. That hope drives me to push myself. To keep trying to make that life I want.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our hopes have very different meaning, and the obvious counter-argument against me is that your definition fits the broader sense more closely. However, I don&amp;#39;t believe that&amp;#39;s true. If you look at how hope is portrayed in the media such as the prevalence of stories with happy-endings, or classic literature with hope as a main theme (&lt;em&gt;Grapes of Wrath&lt;/em&gt; comes to mind), then it seems like the idea of &amp;quot;things will get better&amp;quot; is pretty common. The same argument could be made for many religions (and they often spur you into action with the idea that actions leads to divine favor in the afterlife).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you have no action to take.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lets say your wife was on the Malaysian airliner that vanished a few months ago. What action would you take? You would reach a point that all of your actions lead to the same result of you still being no closer to finding your wife. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At some point, you have two options. Option A is accept she is gone, whilst option B is to hope that something somewhere might suggest she is still alive. There is nothing you can do to influence option B, and it will most likley turn into Option A at some point down the line.... but hope could be argued as the gap between action and acceptance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"CMV: Morality is relative. Like, completely relative.","Edit: I just realized that there's a Popular Topic archive with this topic in it. I'm not sure if the mods are supposed to leave this one or remove it, but I'll be reading through some of the older versions of this topic.  Let me preface this by saying that I'm not okay with raping babies. However, the idea of moral relativity, and the question, ""How far can we take it?"" are troubling ones. I've done some careful thinking and I believe that there are no objective morals at all. I'm interested in hearing what others think of my case, and equally interested in hearing theirs.  Basically, my case for complete moral relativity is this:  * Human perception of morality varies wildly based on time, place, situation, and who you ask. For example, many of the moral guidelines described in religious texts would be completely unacceptable today, but back then they were the norm. We don't consider people from those eras of those religions ""evil,"" even if we do say they are misguided. Therefore, it follows that morality must depend on context.  * As another example, I once had a very heated argument with a religious friend who claimed that cannibalism was objectively wrong. It is disrespectful to the dead. However, some cultures consider eating your dead a way of showing respect. It does not seem fair to call these people ""evil"" for doing what their culture does. In addition, if a person's survival depends on cannibalism, it does not seem fair to call them evil to prioritize their own life over the sanctity of a corpse. Therefore, even things that ""feel"" wrong to us, like eating human flesh, cannot be.  * Humans do not agree on moral issues. Euthanasia, abortion, and war are controversial issues. If morality were objective, we would all agree on these issues.  * Legality is a human construct, and is an attempt to enforce objective morality onto a relatively moral world. This is why the law is not always right. For example, criminals can sometimes get away with their actions by finding a loophole, and innocent people can be punished for breaking the law, even when it seems obvious that their actions were not immoral and did not present any significant danger to anyone. Therefore, objective morality cannot work in the real world.  * Human morality often reflects evolution. (And evolution can be used to explain certain ""objective"" morals) We intuitively value altruism because it is good for the population. We despise child abuse because we have an instinctive urge to protect our young. Most, if not all, of the things we consider ""objectively wrong"" are things that are harmful, to the individual or to the whole. It's probable, therefore, that a different civilization evolved in different conditions would not follow our objective morality. We cannot safely consider them ""evil,"" so we must conclude that even if their morality is completely different from ours, they are still just as morally correct.  * To use an example from popular culture, the Formics from Ender's Game possess no free will on an individual level, and do not consider killing morally wrong. Humans hold free will and agency in high regard, yet the Formics do not, and even a seemingly objective moral rule, ""Don't kill people,"" is not universal. However, as the author demonstrates, this does not make them evil. It just means that finding common morals is very difficult, if possible at all.  From this case, it seems that the only possible moral code is that there isn't one; Morality is determined by those it concerns. Child abuse, rape, murder, stealing, these things are wrong *because we consider them wrong*, and because they are harmful to us. Objective morality of any kind cannot exist.  This is not to say that I believe serial killers are just as moral as saints. It is clear that morals are necessary to the structure of society. We still must stop criminals who are harmful to society, even if we are unclear on the most moral way to go about doing so. We still must have moral standards, to help individuals get along with each other and keep humans happy. However, we have to accept that objective morality is inherently flawed.  Edit: I've gotten some very good replies, and I'm answering all I can. I think I've arrived at the following conclusion:  Morality cannot be thought of as strictly objective or relative. Instead, there are certain things that almost all humans can agree are immoral, such as murder and rape, so they are objectively wrong. These are usually defined by what is beneficial to humanity's survival. On the other hand, there are some things that are, at least at the moment, impossible to objectively determine as right or wrong, and for these we have to rely on personal experience and careful reflection until we have a better way of deciding.  So I have changed my view a little, and I'm working on refining this into something a little clearer. Thank you guys for your input. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

One by one:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Human perception of morality varies wildly based on time, place, situation, and who you ask.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But this is true of non-moral matters as well. Humans used to think that the sun revolved around the Earth, and now we think that the Earth revolves around the sun. But this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that there&amp;#39;s no fact of the matter about astronomy. So the fact that moral beliefs change can&amp;#39;t be evidence to think that there&amp;#39;s no fact of the matter of morality.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;As another example, I once had a very heated argument with a religious friend who claimed that cannibalism was objectively wrong. It is disrespectful to the dead. However, some cultures consider eating your dead a way of showing respect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, there a couple of different responses the committed moral realist might offer here. First, we might say that one of these groups is simply wrong: maybe religions that think cannibalism is wrong are mistaken, or maybe cultures that practice cannibalism are mistaken. This isn&amp;#39;t a very appealing response, though. A more promising response is to say that respecting the dead is a moral imperative. Which actions count as respectful toward the dead might vary by culture, but this doesn&amp;#39;t mean that what&amp;#39;s right and wrong actually varies by culture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Humans do not agree on moral issues...If morality were objective, we would all agree on these issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But again, humans disagree about all sorts of issues. For instance, there&amp;#39;s disagreement about which interpretation of quantum physics is correct, but that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to suggest that there&amp;#39;s no fact of the matter about which interpretation is correct. In fact, disagreement is a pretty good indicator that there is a fact of the matter--otherwise, what could the disagreement even be about?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are at least some moral issues that face widespread agreement. Pretty much everyone agrees, I take it, that it&amp;#39;s wrong to set babies on fire for fun. There are controversial moral questions, but I don&amp;#39;t think most moral questions are controversial.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Legality is a human construct, and is an attempt to enforce objective morality onto a relatively moral world. This is why the law is not always right. For example, criminals can sometimes get away with their actions by finding a loophole, and innocent people can be punished for breaking the law, even when it seems obvious that their actions were not immoral and did not present any significant danger to anyone. Therefore, objective morality cannot work in the real world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This reasoning seems very confused to me. You conclude that &amp;quot;objective morality cannot work in the real world,&amp;quot; but objective morality isn&amp;#39;t supposed to &amp;quot;work.&amp;quot; The thesis that there exist mind-independent moral facts isn&amp;#39;t a plan of action that can succeed or fail to succeed. If I say that objective morality exists, I haven&amp;#39;t said anything about whether or not people act in the morally correct way. And moreover, if you believe that &amp;quot;the law is not always right,&amp;quot; it looks like you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to believe that there are objective moral facts, because there has to be a standard that the law fails to meet when it goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Human morality often reflects evolution. (And evolution can be used to explain certain &amp;quot;objective&amp;quot; morals) We intuitively value altruism because it is good for the population. We despise child abuse because we have an instinctive urge to protect our young.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure, but there are lots of counterexamples too. For instance, most people agree that racism is morally wrong, but there are evolutionary benefits to racism. Rape is also evolutionarily beneficial under some circumstances, but we&amp;#39;re still pretty convinced that rape is wrong. So it&amp;#39;s not like our moral beliefs are slaves to our evolutionary origins. That may be the origin of many of our moral beliefs, but we&amp;#39;re pretty good at reasoning, and we&amp;#39;ve abandoned some of the ones we decided were wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;•Human perception of morality varies wildly based on time, place, situation, and who you ask.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So does physics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t consider people from those eras of those religions &amp;quot;evil,&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Depends, but sometimes we do.  Whether or not we say they are evil has nothing to do with whether they are actually evil, of course.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, some cultures consider eating your dead a way of showing respect. It does not seem fair to call these people &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot; for doing what their culture does&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To go back to the physics example, we wouldn&amp;#39;t call people whose culture has a different physics model &amp;quot;stupid&amp;quot;, even if they are incorrect.  That said, it&amp;#39;s quite possible that the real moral answer is &amp;quot;It is moral to show respect to the dead, immoral to show disrespect to the dead, but what constitutes respect is culturally based&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;•Humans do not agree on moral issues. Euthanasia, abortion, and war are controversial issues. If morality were objective, we would all agree on these issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Humans do not agree on physics or even math.  Global warming, string theory, and even the Monty Hall problem are all controversial issues.  Math clearly shows that there is one answer to the Monty Hall problem, but even mathematicians don&amp;#39;t actually all agree on it.  Math and science can be objective without people agreeing on these issues.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;•Legality is a human construct, and is an attempt to enforce objective morality onto a relatively moral world. This is why the law is not always right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure, but this is a criticism of laws and not morality.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore, objective morality cannot work in the real world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, it can&amp;#39;t be translated perfectly into law, but that&amp;#39;s different from not working.  Math can&amp;#39;t be translated perfectly into a computer program, but math still works in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;•Human morality often reflects evolution. (And evolution can be used to explain certain &amp;quot;objective&amp;quot; morals)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a &amp;quot;just so story&amp;quot; and is not actually justified by data.  Your specific examples here are likely incorrect (see The Selfish Gene for why they&amp;#39;re problematic), but even if you picked more accurate examples, we still don&amp;#39;t have any real evidence to show which attitudes are evolved and which aren&amp;#39;t.

"CMV: Religious tollerance is pointless, religions are not equal and have no place in modern society","Specifically regarding the ""big 3"" (Christians, Jews, Muslims) but most religions have similar issues. Firstly I'll start by saying I would never persicute a person for their religious beleifs. But, claiming all religons are equal is simply incorrect in my view. Granted, all adherants to a religion do not hold the same beliefs, but this is based in the personal choice of the adherants to not follow their scripture. I.e. The bible states clearly that homsexuality is a sin. This is a belief incompatible with the modern world so by claiming yourself tobe Christian, I will assume you hold antiquard beleifs untill such time as you deny them. After that Ill just think you are an imbicile for not undestanding your scripture. Any person who openly identifies as a religious adherant must accept the consequences that they will be judged on the merits of their religion untill they prove they do not hold the regressive views of their religion.  Edit: Ill also add that this only applies to people living in a situation in which their freedom to express any religious sentiment is a given.  Edit 2: religious adherants are not all the same and the majority do not hold the beleifs of their texts to be law and the dialogue coming from religious entities is normally hijacked by extremists who do view the text as sacred. Still, no matter how moderate contemporary Nazis may become I see no reason to associate with them. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I think dressing super sexy is to sexual harassement/ rape what leaving your wallet on your car seat is to car break-in on parking lots. CMV,"just so I'm clear. the girl is ALWAYS the victim. I do not support any kind of sexual harassment.  But knowing there are vicious, violent, frustrated and dangerous men who are not afraid to commit sexual assault, and still dressing imodestly, revealing 80% of your body in a ""sexy"" way, is quite provocative, and increases your chances of being harassed / assaulted. Like leaving your wallet on your car seat in a parking lot. You know there are people who are ready to break in your car to get it, it is recommended not to leave anything visible to avoid temptation...yet for girls this measure of precaution doesnt seem to make sense.  As an american humorist said (kind of, I can't find the quote) ""if I'm wearing a cop uniform, you'd be right to run to me and reach for help shouting ""Officer Help me!! "" well when I see girls nowadays, they are wearing a whore's uniform, no wonder they are getting attention.""  So.. yeah. change my view. I'd be glad to answer anything to clear up my view if I wasnt explicit enough.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of sexual harassment, maybe. This generally covers women being groped or cat-called. As an attractive woman, though, I will tell you I get just as much of this in jeans as a tshirt as otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rape. Absolutely not. Rape is about power, not about sex. This explains why the vast majority of rape is &amp;quot;aquaintance rape.&amp;quot; When you realize this, it doesn&amp;#39;t really make sense to think that a girl just looked incredibly sexy one day so her acquaintance just couldn&amp;#39;t help himself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Do some research on the subject.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I assume your mental model of the situation goes something like this.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rapist. I am horny. Let me look for someone to rape. Ah, a woman. Hmm, her clothes are skimpy so I can see her body and am attracted so I will rape her.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Woman. Nooo, my feminist freedoms. I will yell out!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rapist. I care not for your cries, it is time for rape!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Correct?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&amp;amp;context=djglp""&gt;http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&amp;amp;context=djglp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reality is that rapists mostly don&amp;#39;t notice the clothing of women they are raping, according to polls, and they mostly target submissiveness, not sexiness. They want someone who won&amp;#39;t yell out. What sort of clothes indicate submissiveness? Clothes that cover most of your body. You have to be very confident to wear skimpy clothes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So by your model, should we tell people to always dress super sexy so that they look confident to rapists?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s another issue. Often when people are raped they are blamed for it, and as such don&amp;#39;t receive justice. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Officer, she wasn&amp;#39;t wearing many clothes, clearly she wanted attention and sex and so we shouldn&amp;#39;t prosecute the rapist&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The humorist touches on that. If you&amp;#39;re write to run to an officer and ask for help, are you right to run to a girl in whore&amp;#39;s clothing and rape her?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That sort of attitude is very bad for justice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"On this date 2058 years ago, in an act of shocking betrayal, Brutus and his co-conspirators killed Julius Caesar. However I believe Brutus is more worthy of celebration than Caesar - CMV","I have always found it peculiar that Western civilization holds Julius Caesar in such high regard.  He was the man who arguably had the greatest hand in ending the Roman Republic, resulting in the establishment a tyrannical empire whose influence would last centuries - thus, Caesar was a man worthy of assassination.  And yet his assassins, Marcus Junius Brutus, Gaius Cassius Longinus, and as many as 60 others, are more often reviled than celebrated.  For example, in Dante's *Inferno*, Brutus inhabits the deepest pit of Hell, tormented by Satan himself alongside the likes of Judas Iscariot.  It is fortunate that today, the West more closely follows the ideas of the Roman Republic rather than the Empire, but this is a recent development.  Throughout the Middle Ages and up until the recent past, the West was dominated by an imperialist political ideology that drew much of its inspiration from the Empire created by Caesar.  I'm not arguing that Caesar himself can be directly blamed for all of Western history's imperial abuses.  I'm arguing that if we now value liberty over despotism, we should celebrate Brutus more than Caesar.    If anything, Brutus set an example worth following.  As a former trusted friend of Caesar, Brutus' betrayal may be unsettling.  But that's just my point - Brutus set aside his personal feelings and risked his life and reputation to do something that he believed would benefit the greater good.  &gt; If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of &gt;Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar &gt;was no less than his. If then that friend demand &gt;why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: &gt;--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved &gt;Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and &gt;die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live &gt;all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him; &gt;as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was &gt;valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I &gt;slew him.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caesar, while his military career is impeccable, is often forgotten about when discussing the other good things he did for Rome. So, I&amp;#39;m not going to mention the military aspect of him. We all well know of the riches and land secured for the Roman people, the increasing quality of military strategy, and the better pay and life for legionaries. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Julius Caesar, while his family was notorious for their hatred of plebs, went after many patricians. Caesar offered no mercy towards corrupted governors and satraps across the whole empire. He even took strides to make many things that were previously status quo (in the Republic), illegal: such as extortion, bribery, etc etc. Just to reiterate, he enacted laws &lt;strong&gt;as a dictator&lt;/strong&gt; that protected many more than were ever protected &lt;strong&gt;in their own democracy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He also put forth bills that were in support of land redistribution, public-work jobs for the poor, and even created a pseudo-newspaper that was to be distributed to the plebs so they could be up to date on what was going on in the senate and the greater SPQR.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All in all, Caesar was not an angel, he became a near-omnipotent ruler. That being said, he did the best job a dictator could do at being a just ruler, and always seemed to act in Rome&amp;#39;s best interest, even if it did harm some. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grasp of Roman history is not the greatest, but I&amp;#39;ve always seen the assassination as an oligraphy that&amp;#39;s trying to maintain the status quo. Basically, the Senate was filled with patricians who didn&amp;#39;t care about the needs of the common man, the plebian. The Senate didn&amp;#39;t even represent the plebians. The plebians had their own government assembly like &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebeian_Council""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebeian_Tribune#Plebeian_tribune""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, which were always at odds with the Senate and often had to play second fiddle to the Senate. Not to mention that plebians had fewer rights during the Roman Republic and it was harder to become a Roman citizen during the Roman Republic than during the (later parts of the?) Roman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And as for Brutus, I mostly saw him as a traditionalist who felt compelled to assassinate Caesar because &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Junius_Brutus""&gt;his ancestor&lt;/a&gt; founded the Roman Republic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0

Always talking about it's the greatest thing ever made. Always having a weird smell that kinda gives me a headache. Wasting money on a drug, and food, instead of saving for rent, or something better.   Also /r/trees is all just about ""WEED, WEED, WEED, WEED, LEGALIZE IT.""

I guess it comes from our neighbors before they moved. They drunk alcohol and smoked weed all day. And they played music though out the night, and it blasted though walls. Eventually the manager told them to either turn it down, or stop playing music. It didn't really work, so it was made to have no loud noises past 10PM/22 Hours.  I mean, most of the time, I am positive to things I do not like/do not believe in. If you're Christan, Jewish, etc. I don't mind. I used to be an Anti-Theist, but I've changed my ways.

You seem to have grouped all people who smoke weed as &amp;quot;stoners.&amp;quot; But people who smoke weed are a large and diverse group of people, who range from elderly and disabled who need it for purely medicinal reasons, to people who enjoy it&amp;#39;s calming and relaxing qualities in the comfort of seclusion from others, to obnoxious party goers in the &amp;quot;420&amp;quot; life. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I see nothing wrong with hating people who are extremely obnoxious and negatively impact others. However, I do see something wrong with assuming all people who smoke weed are obnoxious and harmful to others.

Obama smoked weed. Clinton smoked weed. TONS of people smoked weed (for extended periods of time, even) and are a lot smarter than you or me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maybe some stoners talk about it being the greatest thing ever, but no one I know (they may say it is better than alcohol, and I have no issue with that.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You think all stoners have a weird smell? I&amp;#39;m not even sure how to respond to that. Sure, after smoking weed they may smell (but someone who just smoked cigarettes or drank a lot of booze will smell even worse.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wasting money on a drug instead of saving for rent? What? Stoners can&amp;#39;t pay rent because they spend all their money on weed? You pay $10 to see a movie for 2 hours and a stoner pays $10 for a gram of weed to get high for 2 hours- I&amp;#39;m not sure I see much of a difference. What about spending money needlessly on alcohol? Tobacco? Psychics? Cars? Anything? Unless they are unable to provide for themselves, I&amp;#39;m not sure what the issue is.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, that post from &lt;a href=""/r/rage""&gt;/r/rage&lt;/a&gt; could have just as easily been a non-stoner. Kids are stupid and do stupid shit.

CMV: It's not my job to take care of drunk friends.,"A lot of anti-rape posters ask people to take care of drunk friends. While those is the inspiration of this post, that is not the only situation that this post applies to.  You often hear that you should take care of your drunk friends, make sure they get home safely, keep them away from dangerous situations/people etc... I think that's bullshit. It's their responsibility to make sure they don't get so drunk that they can't take care of themselves.  I will absolutely take care of someone drinking for the first time, I will make sure they get home safe, put them on their side, etc... However, one should learn one's limit after the first few times. It's not acceptable that people just drink too much and expect their friends to take care of them. In the case of the first few times I'll take care of the person because they don't know their limit and they're still exploring alcohol. After a while, they should know their limit and it's their choice to drink too much and I shouldn't have to take care of them because of their bad mistakes.  Edit: One of the comments made me realize what my issue with those posters is. It's not that they ask people to take care of drunk friends, it's that they don't tell people to ensure they don't drink too much. I've only seen ONE poster that tells people to not drink too much. If you do a google image search for ""be smart rape poster"" you'll see it. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

CMV: I believe that being attractive is the single most important trait in determining how strangers will treat you.,"As an above-average but not stellar looking dude, I understand that in certain scenarios I get treated better than someone who is less attractive than I am. Similarly, when there is someone more attractive than me, I am largely ignored. I don't think this is a matter of youth, as I'm now in my mid-20s and this has persisted with people of all ages.   Women who are attractive get tons of preferential treatment, there's no doubt about that, but I believe it extends to men too and is the single most important factor in determining how people treat you at first. Not kindness, not wealth, but largely your physical appearance. My breakdown would be 70% face/body/how you carry yourself, 30% how you are dressed.   This leads to *vastly* different life experiences in that ugly children and attractive children are treated significantly differently than one another, leading to differences in how they view the world, strangers, and social interaction.   The puzzling question is why? In the case of attractive men and women who are of age, you could argue that wanting to mate with them or improve social status, but even when this is unlikely or impossible (one party is married - don't snicker) the preferential treatment continues. Is it because they are pleasing to look at? Why does that matter so much?   Here I would place an attempt to rebut a counterargument but I can't even begin to think of one, which is why I made this post. Physical appearance is largely out of our control beyond good hygiene and how you dress. It's a pretty depressing thought to think that someone's whole life experience is determined by a roll of the dice, and I'd like someone to change my view on this.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It makes sense that you put attractiveness above other things that don&amp;#39;t negatively effect you personally.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your breakdown for example, doesn&amp;#39;t include skin color, which if you even just search this subreddit is an attractiveness dealbreaker for many.

The ends justify the means. CMV.,"This was inspired by the ""kill two people to save one"" thread that was started a few days ago.   This ideology is very often associated with terrible dictators and death and genocide, but I think that far more people actually hold it than let on. I very honestly believe that, if a result is favourable, the method used to reach it is very often irrelevant. A small note must be made here about probability: an action I take has a 1% chance of success, and succeeds, is *less* justified than if I had taken an action  which had a 60% chance of success but failed. So I suppose my view could be refined as ""in cases where the only variable of a set of actions or methods is the effect of said actions, unsavoury actions are justified "", so this is more of a philosophical CMV than a practical one.   A few examples would be pertinent. **I AM WELL AWARE THAT SUCH SCENARIOS ARE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE AND AM MERELY USING THEM AS THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS, THANK YOU.**   * I believe that the Trolley Problem, that is, killing one person to save more than one person given that you know nothing of any of the participants, is justified in all it's forms. If I have to make a choice to kill 49% of the Earth's population to save 51%, the answer is the same.  There are only two actions to take, each have a 100% success rate, and the only variable is the result. Whether I am a passive observer or an active participant makes no real difference.   * Rights and freedoms should be abolished if they demonstrably shown to have some net negative effect on society. If we created a controlled experiment to test the effect of freedom of the press on, say, the general happiness of the population, average IQ, life expectancy, and median household income, and find that a free press reduces every one of these things in the long run, than that particular freedom is unjustified and should be removed.   * If it can be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that China's one-child policy will have a net-positive effect on society (say we create a parallel universe where the only difference is parallel-China does not create this policy), than the policy is justified, so long as the only thing we can change is whether or not to enact the policy. All future legislative policies *must* remain the same between the two Chinas.   ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with this stance is that it permits suspension of moral standards based on the perceptions of the person making the decision.  In other words, &lt;em&gt;society&lt;/em&gt; has dictated rules for the &amp;quot;means&amp;quot; -- killing is wrong, rape is wrong, treat people equally, don&amp;#39;t steal or threaten, etc. -- but the &amp;quot;ends&amp;quot; are decided &lt;em&gt;by an individual&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By saying the ends justify the means, you are saying that a person may ignore what society has decided is right based &lt;em&gt;solely on what they perceive to be right&lt;/em&gt;.  You are, in effect, saying that each person is welcome to define morality however suits them, since the &amp;quot;ends&amp;quot; are valued according to them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even if you (somehow) construct a situation where society at large has equal participation in both means and ends, there is still a temporal argument to be made; i.e. valuation of &amp;quot;means&amp;quot; evolve with a society and are frequently tested and refined, whereas &amp;quot;ends&amp;quot; are by definition a single data point -- a single decision.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Saying ends over means is equivalent to saying personal gain over social morals, which is a rejection of the social contract.  You have the right to reject the social contract; society then has the right to reject you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t try to convince you that &amp;quot;unsavoury&amp;quot; actions are never justified. For instance, there is the argument that the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombings, while &amp;quot;unsavoury&amp;quot;, were justified, because it shortened the war and indirectly saved many lives. I don&amp;#39;t agree with it, but the evaluation of these bombings - whether they were justified or not - is not so clear-cut.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, what I will argue is that &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;unsavoury&amp;quot; actions have a high cost&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most of human interactions require trust. For instance, I go buy some bread to my local baker&amp;#39;s because I trust him not to put sawdust in his products. Trusting people you know is rather easy; trusting people you don&amp;#39;t know looks like a leap of faith. This is one of the reasons why we have laws: so that the cooperative actions are favorized, and trust can be established between strangers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let us look at the trolley problem. Let&amp;#39;s say you have killed one bystander to save two people. If we look at this result, we could think it is a gain (or not the worst loss). However, you have established that &lt;em&gt;you are confortable with living in a world were killing a bystander can be justified&lt;/em&gt;. As such, everybody could kill anybody, if it were for the greater good. And, especially &lt;em&gt;everyone could kill you&lt;/em&gt;. For the greater good, of course, but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter much when you get the bad end of the stick.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, try to trust people who would be fine shooting you if they believed they were right. Try to trust in a law when it could be put aside at any moment for the greater good. The idea that &amp;quot;laws are always to be respected&amp;quot; is perhaps a fiction, but it is a useful fiction, which should not be made light of.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hence, I think that the notion that &amp;quot;the end justify the means&amp;quot; is, ultimalely, harming the trust that we need to live together as a society. For the second and third examples you give, a similar argument can be made. The government could restrict our rights for the greater good, but as such, signals that other rights could also be restricted - which can reduce the trust the people have in the government.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once you factor this moral hazard, the evaluation of whether a particular end justify a particular means is much harder, and the balance goes against those &amp;quot;unsavoury&amp;quot; actions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I'm not a feminist simply because I don't see much gender inequality that isn't simply biological differences between men and women. CMV.,"The hunter-gatherer developed naturally as complementary roles in society. This led to women's oppression, I agree, but now it seems to be fixed for the most part (unless we are talking about certain parts where there is obvious oppression). I don't really see there to be a difference in the workplace when it comes to wages and work conditions, as well as women in the home, because I see there are getting to be more and more stay-at-home dads and more women assuming men's positions in the workforce and at home.

Think of this in another way, the average difference in any ability between genders is smaller than the difference caused by proper training or talent within the same gender.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tl; dr biology doesn&amp;#39;t support any form of gender inequality be it cultural, social or sexual&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;because I see there are getting to be more and more stay-at-home dads and more women assuming men&amp;#39;s positions in the workforce and at home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;consider the life you live.  even every day life.  like, driving in a car.  or eating food.  those things are described biologically, but the what, the how, and the why are largely due to other factors.  Why do we consider  biology to be a determiner of how we behave in big, overwhelming blocs?  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I dunno, but today I tested blood so that it could be transfused into another person&amp;#39;s body, and that, expressly, is hard to figure as natural.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 33.  In evolutionary biology terms, I should be pretty close to death.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Make sense?  No?  Then whey would you use it to determine whether or not we have what we might deem a &amp;quot;fair society&amp;quot; or whether or not that society has reached &amp;quot;fairness&amp;quot;.  What is &amp;quot;fairness&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;equality&amp;quot; biologically speaking?  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is where you might bring in other concepts that are not directly determined by our biology or what we know of from evolutionary biology.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;it&amp;#39;s a big leap to determine that how we behave is solely dependent on our evolutionary history, while we sit typing at keyboards, on a computer, over the internet, inside of a dwelling made mostly of artificial materials, that we in, most likely, no way shape or form built ourselves.  so why is that we think that our lives are so concordant with such paradigms?  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;so why would we expect social concepts, like &amp;quot;male&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;female&amp;quot; to be directly derived from natural components, when the idea of &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; itself is highly confusing and assumptive?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was also born in a Cesarean section.  Naturally, both me and my mother were supposed to die because we were genetically deficient.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt; what about your modern day life isn&amp;#39;t natural, and if it&amp;#39;s not, then why should gender roles be described by it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: I think many people posting CMVs don't actually want to be convinced of anything but just want an outlet to make an argument/rant that they are proud of.,"Often these threads espouse completely reasonable views and offer no motive whatsoever as to why somebody would want this view changed (ex: ""Hitler was bad"" ""Climate change is a real thing"" or ""People should be nice to each other CMV"") **EDIT:** There also seems to be a lack of open-mindedness and common abandonment of new threads by some OPs. If anything these people just want to argue and/or change the views of those who respond to them.  Usually lots of commenters respond to the post with long explanations and attempts at changing the perspective or changing the terms of the argument as a whole, but the OP just inevitably sidesteps it or ignores it altogether. OPs in these posts rarely concede points, even if they don't entirely change their views. Most of the time the OP won't even be active in the discussions in the comment section--yet the moderators won't remove their post for violating either rule E or B. This is because it is often pretty dicey to decide what really constitutes soapboxing and what is a genuine post.  ~~As an auxiliary view, I think the rules should be amended to ""must include a motive for why you want this view to be changed.""~~ This view has already been changed. It would be detrimental to the sub to attempt this.  Otherwise we get a bunch of posts like these:  ~~[one of the top posts of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1xfnri/i_believe_its_insensitive_to_expect_the_poor_to/)~~ This one was problematic for several reasons so I've removed it.  [another top post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/20293g/i_believe_that_reactionary_responses_to_terrorist/)  [then there are a bunch of these every day](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2iruvl/cmv_i_think_we_should_ban_people_from_major_ebola/)  [like this thread, currently top of CMV](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2j5lqx/cmv_columbus_day_is_a_national_embarrassment_and/)   I want this view changed because I want to be convinced that there's some underlying benefit to such posts or that there is generally just something I'm missing. Currently I feel like these sorts of flotsam posts detract from the spirit of the subreddit as a whole.   **EDIT:** Amended some of the original post to indicate where the discussion has gone so far and what has been changed.  **EDIT2:** It seems the discussion has mainly ended up at the position that, despite the intention of the OP, the posts foster intellectual dialogue and debates which can be quite fruitful just for their own sake and that *this* is what makes the subreddit the gem it is today. I agree that it's a beautiful thing and that this is something to be encouraged (and I awarded a delta to somebody who allowed me to see this perspective) but remember that **the expressed purpose of the subreddit is ""For people who have an opinion on something but accept that they may be wrong or want help changing their view""** and that what I'm claiming is that many people don't actually hold either of those views. The argument goes that we can't really determine what someone's intentions *are* in the first place and so censorship of posts on these bases would be messy to say the least. I completely agree with that assessment. I still think that many people (perhaps even most) post here because they want to test their view against an educated public scrutiny and I admire that motive, but while *I do not think that is in keeping with the purpose of the sub* I also think that it somehow manages to *keep with the spirit of the sub.* I might be teetering on the brink of a large view change so please feel free to address this new edit if you so choose.  **EDIT3:** It seems another common thread between many posts is that a lot of these OPs I speak of are really using /r/changemyview as /r/challengemyview and I agree that this isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'd leave it to the mods to determine how that jives with the rules, function, and purpose of the subreddit, but to answer all of you at once, I think it is still slightly disingenuous (even if it produces positive results in the end) to post a view you have no intention of changing but just want to bounce around. I think something should be done about that. One person suggested renaming the sub to /r/challengemyview and, while implausible, that would be the kind of provision that would placate me. Perhaps just an explicit rule in the sidebar saying ""views can/cannot be voiced in terms of a challenge"" (the decision whether to permit or forbid left at the discretion of the mods of course) would suffice. It just seems to me that somebody who so firmly holds a view that they'd voice it as a challenge aren't *usually* open to having it changed, but to test its strength in battle so to speak. Thoughts?  **EDIT4:** Really happy to see the vigorous discussion going on in here. Something else I've noticed as I've read all of your posts: there seems to be an unintentional conflating of the prescriptive and the descriptive. Many of you are talking about how, in practice, this sub ends up garnering a lot of valuable intellectual dialogue due to the sometimes adversarial (""challenging"") nature of posts. I agree that I like that too (as stated earlier) but I think that we should try shifting the focus a little bit more to the prescriptive (""what *should* CMV be like and what is it meant to be""). I think certain policies might have different implications on the culture/atmosphere of this sub, like removing plausibly deniable soapbox posts or, conversely, allowing them  by amending the rules to include challenges or an explicitly lax requirement on OP feedback. One person suggested including /r/offmychest on the sidebar for those who just want to vent. What do you guys think the implications might be for these policies? I'm not sure I really hold a side on these but my view is definitely open to being changed toward one.  **EDIT5:** *No* this post is not ironic or a tu quoque fallacy.   &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If a view is serious enough to be posted here, it should not be easily changed. Many of those views are also essentially correct. They can benefit from being clarified, not discarded.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m open to changing my views on a variety of topics if someone presents surprising evidence, but I estimate a low probability that there exists such evidence. If I estimated a high probability, &lt;em&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t have that view&lt;/em&gt;. I would like to discuss such views here because I think they are important, both to defend them if I&amp;#39;m right, but also to change them if surprising evidence arises. I&amp;#39;m discouraged from discussing such views here by folks who expect that views should be easily changed for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think it detracts from the usefulness of this subreddit that it is named &amp;quot;Change My View&amp;quot;. Taken literally, this suggests that only people with non-serious, uninformed, or easily changed views should post here. A more useful name would be &amp;quot;Challenge My View&amp;quot;.

I LOVED the discussion we have had so far.  Maybe I can do more tomorrow.   So, I'm probably get a ton of downvotes because no one cares about reddiquette, but I am genuine in changing my view. ___ First things first: **DEFINITIONS.**  Because I don't want to spend my time squabbling over them and getting nowhere.  'Upper Case' **Communism:** Refers to the Leninist, Marxist-Leninist, or Marxist-Leninist-Maoist states that have a Communist or Vanguard Party. (YES, any other socialist that reads this, I am aware that so called Communist states weren't communist, it's just easier to say this)  'Lower case' **communism:** The final utopian end stage for almost all socialist ideologies, where the state and money is abolished, the socioeconomic class structure is destroyed, and private property ceases to exist in favor of community ownership. This is why 'communist state' is an oxymoron.  *The fruits of labor (food, clothing, housing, etc.) are provided ""from each according to her ability, to each according to her need.""*   **Socialism:** HUGE broad system of ideologies, united under the definition of:: Democratic ownership of the means of production.  Can also refer to the transition stage between capitalism and communism.  Ranges from anarchism (horizontally divided decentralized power) to state socialism/capitalism (vertically stacked centralized power)  **Capitalism:** Private ownership of the means of production, characterized by social AND economic inequality, and lack of worker democracy in workplaces.  **Means of Production/Property:** Facilities and resources to produce goods, like factories; Productive assets.  **Private Property:** Anything else a person owns that does not fall under Means of Production or Property, like family heirlooms, toys, and clothes.  **Leninism:** Vladimir Lenin's socialist ideology, where the proletariat revolts against the ruling class, but the 'best and brightest' of the proletariat represents them and forms a Vanguard or Communist Party. It is characterized by the use of Soviet Worker Councils to help democratically manage means of production and the economy, and the state which is controlled both by the Supreme Soviet Council and the Vanguard/Communist Party; the state is expected to wither away or become abolished after industrialization and development are achieved and communism is possible.   **Marxism:** A materialist philosophy that is also the foundation and justification for a branch of socialist ideologies.  Not a political ideology itself.  **State Capitalism/State Socialism:** Many people see this as a criticizing word of Communist states, but I see it as a general term that describes any socialist system where power is centralized. (Before socialists come out, Lenin and Marx coined the term and used it to describe the USSR)  I say that state socialism IS state capitalism, but state capitalism is not state socialism.  An entity can only be state socialist if the state itself properly represents the interests of the proletariat, so that the state acts as an extension of the people's community ownership of the means of the production.  If the state ceases to do so, it is not socialist.  **Proletarians/Proletariat:** The workers.  **Bourgeois/Bourgeoisie:** The ruling class, the capitalists.  ___  Second thing, no I do not think Stalin was a good person, but stuff like Holodimir:  &gt;""The 1932 reductions in state procurements and exports proved hopelessly inadequate. So did the regime's attempt to deliver food relief. In a series of decisions in 1932-33, the Politburo reversed its policy to reserve grain relief for the cities. In March 1932, it 'substantially reduced' the food rations... The urban death rate doubled in the main famine regions. Between August 1932 and January 1933, the Politburo reluctantly reduced grain collection plans by 4 million tons, and the state failed to collect a planned 1 million more. In 1932-33, it released 2-3.5 million tons of grain collections for rural consumption as food, seed, and fodder, of which 330,000 tons were for food... Most state agencies, even including the repressive apparatus, were largely overwhelmed by the scale of the famine tragedy.""  https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=Bc30ytJmwzMC&amp;pg=PA502[3]  ___  Third, background history:  Karl Marx had said in his works that socialism is ONLY possible if the transitioning country is INDUSTRIALIZED and DEVELOPED.    His thought process on how society would transition was something like this:  **PreCap(feudalism?)**  **-&gt;**   **Capitalism(industrialization/developing)**  **-&gt;**   **Proletarian Revolution**  **-&gt;**   **Socialist state**  **-&gt;**   **Abolishment of state(communism)**   Now, heres some history 101.  When Russia had it's proletarian revolution during World War 1, they were NOT developed, NOT industrialized, and practically lived in a preCapitalist stage, if not, then barely exposed to capitalism. They also had just fought World War 1.  The combined conflicts resulted in over 10 million Russians being killed.  After the revolution, the Communist party got together and all and had a discussion on the future of Russia.  Here's the thing, they were divided.  One side believed that Karl Marx was 100% correct, and that considering we were underdeveloped, we had to undergo a bourgeois revolution before socialism.  In other words, they were advocating capitalism.  The OTHER side, strongly disagreed.  They thought that capitalism wasn't a necessary stage to reach before socialism.  They had another plan.  You know what this plan was?  It was the detour to communism, a way around capitalism.  State capitalism/socialism.  I can honestly sympathize with the second group, I mean for crying out loud, they lost MILLIONS of russian lives who DIED FIGHTING for socialism, and these punks were telling them no?  Give the power to the capitalists?  Nuh uh, that could mean another century, or even more, before another socialist revolution.  They would be throwing away everything they fought for.  Keep in mind, that at this time, worker conditions were AWFUL.  Handing control to the capitalists was basically ensuring oppression for the workers.     These 2 groups were called the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.  The Bolsheviks advocated state capitalism/socialism, and were lead by Lenin.  Before anyone gets butthurt, Lenin actually called the USSR state capitalist, in one of his quotes, and he saw it as necessary for the union.  The USSR was trying to achieve development through an economic phase that SIMULATED capitalism, without the big disadvantage of losing control of the revolution, and maintaining a capitalist socioeconomic class structure.  And you know what?  It worked.  USSR went from a feudal society of field plowers to a superpower that launched satellites to spaaaaaace and could outfight and out manufacture the Nazis in a 40 year time span. It worked for them.  Just not as they hoped.  ___  FINALLY: My actual post.  A lot of what I could have said was actually said in my background history. So this will be short.  Lenin's USSR was very progressive.  It had free education, healthcare, and abortions.  For coming out of a war that struck out a section of their population close to the double digits, they had done well.  They had a happy populace properly represented by Soviet councils and the Vanguard Party.  Lenin's era was the Golden age for the USSR.  However, Stalin later came in.  Lenin had not wanted Stalin in power, but he got it.  Stalin had taken several measures to consolidate his authority, including reducing the power of the Supreme Soviet Council, and famines like Holodomir had shaken things up.  I wouldn't be surprised considering that again, Russia came out of 2 wars that incredibly devastated their country, AND they were very underdeveloped compared to the rest of the world.  The efficiency of the Communist system though, was very well represented in World War 2.  Stalin's organization of the proletariat and management of war factories had allowed the USSR to OUT MANUFACTURE the Nazi's.  After the battle of Stalingrad, they started pushing them back along with the West.  Remember this as well, the USSR had lost around 20 million people in total casualties as a result of World War 2.  Had Hitler not broken the pact, the Nazi's would have a very real chance of winning.  Despite the now 3 wars they have gone through in 30 years, the USSR became a world super power along with the U.S.  The death of Stalin and the rise of Nikita Khrushchev had led to the de-Stalinization period, and attempts to compete with the U.S., which has not suffered 3 devastating wars in a row for almost 100 years.  They were forced to commodify, and some of Stalin's and Krushchev's changes had led the USSR to have become a degenerated worker's state, in which they cannot hold the title of socialism. (For example, the significant loss of power of the Supreme Soviet in order for Stalin to consolidate power) The USSR, however, still continued to be a prominent power, even going to spaaaaaace first, until liberal economic reforms started affecting the GDP.  Gorbachev put the nail in the coffin with Perestroika.  Glasnost allowed people to dissolve the crippled USSR early, thus leading into the 1990's, a period of intense corruption and an active oligarchy.  Now you have Putin invading Crimea and a country that has an incredibly high crime rate...  Had Lenin not died so early, had the wars not crippled Russia like so, had they not lost over 30 million people in the span of 2 decades, had liberal reforms, corruption, and intense competition with an outright scared U.S. occured, I would imagine that the USSR would have been successful in creating a communist society.  Now, I AM a Libertarian Socialist, and I prefer horizontal power accumulation over vertical, but the fact that the USSR was able to be so successful while still be in a hellhole shows that if the conditions were simply better, the USSR would have been better too.  Socialism is a preferable alternative to capitalism, which has a socioeconomic class structure that creates not just income inequality, but social inequality as well. The bourgeoisie are oppressing the proletariat, just look at Chinese manufacturing by Nike, and Mexican maquiladoras. As Karl Marx had said, capitalism is doomed to fail anyway:  1. Inevitability of monopolies, which eliminate competition and gouge consumers and works.  2. Lack of centralized planning, which results in overproduction of some good and underproduction of others, encouraging economic crises such as inflation, slumps, depressions.  3. Demands for labor-saving machinery, which horse unemployment and a more hostile proletariat.  4. Employers will tend to maximize profits by reducing labor expenses, thus creating a situation where workers will not have enough income to buy the goods produced, creating the contradiction of causing profits to fall.  5. Control of the state by the wealthy, the effect of which is passage of laws favoring themselves.  Capitalism is a ticking time bomb.  One of these days, maybe a few decades later, maybe even a century, it will.  And what about the coming of automation and the possibility of 40% of jobs being destroyed?  What then?  Capitalism cannot solve for these problems.  For Communist states, automaton may actually prove a boon. A UBI could be instated, materials and goods can have better equality at more production, less costs, and if worst comes to worst?  Capitalism will have been destroyed, and there will be no more need for a Communist state, in which it will be abolished and a communist society can begin.  TL;DR:  The fact that the USSR was able to be so successful even being able to compete with the U.S. despite the tens of millions of deaths, wars, and lack of development, means that had it not been for this, the USSR would be successful.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Lenin argued for the &amp;#39;withering away of the state&amp;#39; idea, whereby once you achieve true equality, the state becomes no longer necessary. As an anarchist I just don&amp;#39;t buy that; we&amp;#39;re dealing with power structures here fundamentally and I&amp;#39;d go so far as to argue that the existence of a state perpetuates inequality because you association with the ruling party guarantees favourable treatment. Lenin and the apparatchik lived a far cosier life than your typical Russian farmer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we have situations like the &lt;a href=""http://libcom.org/history/1921-the-kronstadt-rebellion""&gt;Kronstadt rebellion&lt;/a&gt; whereby a bottom-up self-organized labour movement was brutally suppressed by Trostky. Admittedly the USSR was starved for money and resources while a shockingly small number of people tried to transform the largest country on the planet to an entirely new political system. But the point is that strikes were met with the sort of incredible brutality and violence you&amp;#39;d expect under a fascist. This was not, and never was a worker&amp;#39;s state. A brutal dictator like Stalin was, to me, a very easy thing to have happen under Lenin&amp;#39;s model because of the incredible power invested in the very few. Even an inevitability. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were problems with the Soviet Union before Lenin died. I really don&amp;#39;t think there is a good case for thinking everything would have been perfect if only he hadn&amp;#39;t or if someone else besides Stalin had taken over the leadership when he did.

Without general elections, without unrestricted freedom of press and assembly, without a free struggle of opinion, life dies out in every public institution, becomes a mere semblance of life, in which only the bureaucracy remains as the active element. Public life gradually falls asleep, a few dozen party leaders of inexhaustible energy and boundless experience direct and rule. Among them, in reality only a dozen outstanding heads do the leading and an elite of the working class is invited from time to time to meetings where they are to applaud the speeches of the leaders, and to approve proposed resolutions unanimously – at bottom, then, a clique affair – a dictatorship, to be sure, not the dictatorship of the proletariat but only the dictatorship of a handful of politicians, that is a dictatorship in the bourgeois sense, in the sense of the rule of the Jacobins (the postponement of the Soviet Congress from three-month periods to six-month periods!) Yes, we can go even further: such conditions must inevitably cause a brutalization of public life: attempted assassinations, shooting of hostages, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.marxists.org/archive/ruhle/1920/moscow-and-ourselves.htm""&gt;Ruehle:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;*Here we have a revolution... there we have a revolutionary party – what is to be done?

CMV: Scientology is no more absurd than religions like Christianity and Islam," if Scientology survived 1300 years then it wouldn't seem that crazy.  I mean consider that historically leaving Islam was (and still is in some parts) a death sentence , isn't that different to their disconnection policy, the space opera is as crazy as the Buraq tale (the flying horse) or the transparent virgins in Muslim heaven.  The idea of engrams messing with humanity is no more silly than the idea of the holy spirit or the Devil influencing humanity.  The idea of Jesus resurrecting is as daft as the idea of clear souls etc.   Confession is when you give your secrets (""sins"") to a priest to be forgiven, add some rudimentary galvanic skin response stuff and wham you have auditing   Practices like Disconnection displayed by groups like Jehovah's Witnesses is very similar to the Scientology practice of it. The Sea Org isn't a world away from Mormon Missionary work  Then you have the founders, both LRon and Joesph Smith were conmen, the first pope wanted Christianity as a power tool same goes for Muhammed   If Scientology survives for 1300 years I bet it would be seen the same as mainstream religion today _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Every other major religion you generally learn about the mythology upfront or are instructed in it as part of your indoctrination into the religion. They use these mythologies to relate to your daily life and uncover some mystery of the human experience. This instructs you on the tenants of the religion and how a follower should behave. You have to have some sort of faith to call it a religion.  For all major religions the central tenants of your faith are known and generally understood. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With Scientology you aren&amp;#39;t even exposed to the mythology until you&amp;#39;ve already been indoctrinated. You have to be in a preconditioned state to even see the creation story. It&amp;#39;s existence is so obscured that most members will never see it. We aren&amp;#39;t talking about some obscure secret just for the leadership, we are talking about the central tenants of the faith. So the vast majority of Scientologits aren&amp;#39;t learning or expressing their faith, they are just doing some low level psychoanalysis. Those who may be exposed to the mythology have been conditioned to the point where faith is meaningless as they would accept anything as gospel. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;TL;DR Scientology is a religion without faith, until you&amp;#39;ve been indoctrinated to the point where faith is meaningless. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;At face value, you&amp;#39;re right - they&amp;#39;re all just mythologies used to unite a group of people. I don&amp;#39;t dispute that part, nor do I think they&amp;#39;re different when you look at that level of the organizations. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That said, as I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re aware, Scientology is a corrupt organization with a diabolical motive of oppression and exploitation, hidden behind the mask of religion. I&amp;#39;m not a fan of religion myself, and I&amp;#39;m skeptical of organized religion as a whole, but for all the crap I think the major religions are responsible for, Scientology is in a whole other league. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Paying attention to their creation, the organized religions of the world have certainly had their share of ret conning and revisionism to fit a narrative. Scientology was CREATED with that narrative in place to a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Basically, tl;dr - Religions obviously have been or are used to exploit people, but they didn&amp;#39;t start that way, and they don&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;ALL&lt;/em&gt; do that. Scientology was created to exploit people, and always has been nothing but an organization that exploits people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"I'm fairly ashamed of this, so please help me CMV. I believe that the vast majority of parents, no matter how tolerant and loving, would not choose to have a gay child.","Maybe I shouldn't be making claims about what ""the vast majority of parents"" believe, so let's just say, *I* believe I would not want to have a gay child if I could actually control that.  I do not hate gay people, and there are several gay people whom I personally admire.  Them being gay doesn't bother me.  But when it comes to my own (unborn) children... I wouldn't want them to be gay.  Consider this thought experiment:  When a child is born, the parent may select each and everyone one of his or her genetic features.  I believe sexual orientation is largely determined by genes, so this is one of the features to be chosen by the parents.  What do you choose?  Straight, gay, bi, trans, something else, or leave it on ""random""?  I know I would choose straight.  I imagine, though I have no evidence, that the vast majority of people would choose the same.  Not all of those people would be gay haters.  So why is it I feel this way?  Can somebody CMV?  Part of it is the fact that one day I want grandchildren, I guess.  I believe in adoption but somehow I'm a sucker for the idea of having your genes continued.  Maybe my preference for straight children is born out of natural selection?  There's no evidence for that, though (that I know of).  There's also the issue of me not being able to relate to gay children, and vice versa.  For example, how would I talk about boyfriends to my gay son?  Lastly, there's prejudice.  I suppose you could call my views prejudiced.  I'm sorry for that, but this is just the way I feel.  But I'm worried about the hateful, hostile kind of prejudice.  The kind that people like Matthew Shepard fell victim too.  I wouldn't want my gay children to live in a world that was possibly hostile to them.  To be clear, I would love my gay children, very dearly.  Just like I would love children of mine who, by chance, were born with mental handicaps.  But, like mentally handicapped children, no parent *wishes* for one beforehand.  See what I mean?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s important to draw a distinction between tolerance of different culture and &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; of different culture. You can be tolerant and still prefer what you already know and can relate to. I wouldn&amp;#39;t choose for my son or daughter to be a jock because I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to relate to them very well. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean they can&amp;#39;t be one if they want to and it doesn&amp;#39;t imply that I won&amp;#39;t love them, it just won&amp;#39;t be something we have in common. S/He won&amp;#39;t be able to talk to me about the nuances of whatever sport and I won&amp;#39;t be able to talk to them about &amp;lt;insert interest that they don&amp;#39;t have&amp;gt; and that&amp;#39;s just how it is.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Raising a gay son or lesbian daughter would have its own analogous differences. I don&amp;#39;t know what it&amp;#39;s like to be him because I&amp;#39;ve never been in that position or anything like it. And this is without even counting the current social situation for lgbts, which I know &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; about firsthand. How do you give the &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot; to your son when you&amp;#39;ve never done it and don&amp;#39;t really know how it works? If that was something you were looking forward to, you&amp;#39;ll miss out because now it won&amp;#39;t happen. At least not how you imagined. Maybe that&amp;#39;s good and maybe not, but certainly it&amp;#39;s not wrong to be sad about missing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems to apply to any trait that would make life harder for one&amp;#39;s offspring.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;#39;t we have said the same thing about parents preferring to &lt;strong&gt;only have sons&lt;/strong&gt;, many years ago? Some cultures still kill their infant daughters; they only want sons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Likewise, would we say ethnic minorities in the US would choose for their kids to be white?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or rather, wouldn&amp;#39;t we say we would prefer all of society to love our children no matter what their race or gender is?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And wouldn&amp;#39;t the same thing be true about sexual orientation?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr/&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Consider rephrasing the issue. Instead consider whether a parent would prefer their child be born &lt;em&gt;asexual&lt;/em&gt;. Such a child, free from all romantic/sexual instincts, would be &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; to fully dedicate their life to other causes and pursuits. It could actually be a very freeing, empowering thing, in a way. Some of the most world-changing people to live have been single. They don&amp;#39;t have to &amp;quot;juggle&amp;quot; their dedication to the cause alongside a marriage and/or children. (This isn&amp;#39;t to imply marriage or children are bad, not at all -- just that other things matter too.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Can you imagine saying that no parent would ever want their child to have a permanently single life, even if it might lead to good things? Sometimes the &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; of an &amp;quot;advantage&amp;quot; can result in positive things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: Hobby Lobby shouldn't have to pay for Emergency Contraceptives.,"**Okay it's over you can quit downvoting now. fucking christ**  First of all I'm not ""conservative"" and I don't hate women. I'm not religious and I voted for Obama (lol). At first I was upset. You know, the usual ""Don't use your religion to take away our rights"". Plus, it's important women have access to birth control.   Only recently did I learn that Hobby Lobby's policy covers 16 types of birth control, ranging from Condoms to the daily pill.  The only types of birth control they do not want to pay for are emergency contraceptives (the morning after pill) and IUD's for some reason. While I don't understand the IUD part (maybe one of you can explain it to me better), I find the emergency contraceptive part reasonable. My partner and I have needed to use Plan B before. It's a life saver. It's also only about 50 dollars. If you can't afford a 50 dollar pill that will save you from having kids you probably shouldn't be having sex. Plus, Planned Parenthood (bless their souls) provide what they can to those financially lacking. Change my view.  edit: thanks for commenting upvotes all around  Giving it to this person. If I was religious I'd probably be able to argue more but /u/theanswerisforty-two did a damn good job.   http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2aotoi/cmv_hobby_lobby_shouldnt_have_to_pay_for/cixcw5d   I guess I just wish people would be more careful, especially if they can't afford kids in the first place. Ideally everyone would have a lot more personal responsibility but it's not like taking away their avenues of aid is going to help anybody.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will tackle the IUD part. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reason they don&amp;#39;t want to cover the IUD is because in the event that you do get pregnant on the IUD, it could potentially cause a spontaneous miscarriage, due to a piece of metal/plastic being in the uterus where the baby is growing. This, according to Hobby Lobby, is an abortion, though I do argue with their reasoning behind that. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you look at it, getting pregnant in general can cause a spontaneous miscarriage, if they are trying to eliminate all the things that can cause a miscarriage, then they should just tell people to not get pregnant at all, because honestly every pregnancy could potentially result in a miscarriage.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With Hobby Lobby not wanting to cover specific medications due to their religious views, its opening up an entire can of worms for other religiously owned companies. In my opinion, health care should cover every aspect of a persons health, up to and including the morning after pill, which is not an abortion pill, its almost like a hyper dose of birth control that keeps an egg from attaching, which some hormonal birth controls do anyways, but Hobby Lobby does cover them. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, this is where its going to start getting sticky, they are saying that every child deserves to not be aborted, that is their whole stance on this, pro-life. But, their health insurance will continue to cover viagra for men. You see, men don&amp;#39;t have to worry about getting pregnant, so they can get boners and sleep with all the women they want. Now, honestly, if god wanted a mans penis to work after a certain age, he wouldn&amp;#39;t have allowed Erectile dysfunction. I don&amp;#39;t think that health care should cover that, because an erection and sex is a privilege, they should have to pay out of their own pocket. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bit silly don&amp;#39;t you think? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then you have Jehovah witnesses, they don&amp;#39;t believe in blood transfusions, it is forbidden by their religion. What if they try to fight to not have to cover that because their religion doesn&amp;#39;t believe in it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the end it really isn&amp;#39;t about just pro-life vs pro-choice, its now a battle of which religion will chose to opt out of medical coverage based upon x-reasoning. Plan-B could potentially be just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sorry, I got a bit rambly, let me know if something I said didn&amp;#39;t make any sense. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, Hobby Lobby isn&amp;#39;t paying for contraceptives. The employees pay for their insurance and should thus be able to make their own decisions about what medications they do or do not want to be on. The employee doesn&amp;#39;t go to their manager and say &amp;quot;hey can you spot me $50? I had sex irresponsibly last night.&amp;quot; It just doesn&amp;#39;t work like that. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Second, their issue with Plan B and I.U.Ds are that they believe these cause abortions. They don&amp;#39;t. All of the Science behind these medications show that they prevent pregnancy from occuring, not ending it after the egg is fertilized. If you&amp;#39;re already pregnant, these will not help you at all. I.U.D.s are, however, one of the most effective forms of birth control on the market so if they really do want to decrease the number of abortions, not covering the most effective birth controls is really not the way to do so. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Third, it&amp;#39;s great that some people have the income to afford $50 for Plan B without filing for insurance. That is, unfortunately, a luxury not every one has (including adults, not just teens). Pregnancy and giving birth will cost the Insurance company (and the employees who have said policy) more money in the long run by not covering these types of medication. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, this is also about religious freedom vs personal freedom. Hobby Lobby can essentially force their religious beliefs onto their employees by means of limiting what medications they can and can not use. Why should my employer dictate what I can and can not use? Yes, there are lots of different kinds of birth control but the reason for that is because different forms of birth control affect people differently. Paying out of pocket for birth control is expensive and not everyone has access to places like Planned Parenthood. The religious views of the company should not out weigh the medical needs of the individual. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
People who have a stable lives who have mentally and physically sound children live more fulfilling lives than people who choose material or non-family centric lifestyle CMV (mostly looking for opinions from parents),"Since this is an emotionally charged topic, I would like to state this is one part CMV and one part DAE regret the fact they had kids.  If you don't have kids, don't expect to have much leverage in this conversation.  For the sake of eliminating lurking variables, most counterpoints will require experience.  But I understand not all counterpoints will require that.  * People of varying backgrounds with children report it as the most important and fulfilling part of their lives. * People who express regret of having children most often do so because their relationship is\was unstable, their children are mentally or physically unsound or they had children at the wrong time in their life.  * People who have children who have also achieved material (or extrinsic) success rarely state a preference to the material side of life. * People that dedicate their lives to an external cause or purpose are satisfying extrinsically purposed goals.  People that dedicate their lives to their children are satisfying intrinsically purposed goals.  When you become a world class guitar player, you are satisfying goals that society has told you are important.  When you raise a child successfully you are satisfying goals that are innate to your being.  * External causes and purposes :  Living an material lifestyle (working extremely hard to make a lot of money and deriving great pleasure from both the act of making money and life's material goods), working to become a celebrity (and assumably working much more than having a child would normally allow), dedicating your life to strictly political, social or non-primary interactions such as travel, hobbies, music etc. * People with stable lives and children rarely state that they wouldn't trade these things for their children.  For the sake of clarity, some examples.  Rarely would someone tell even a close friend that the wouldn't trade their world travels, Ferrari, or fame for their child.  So it goes to reason, that if you are generally stable and haven't been given unusual circumstances with your child, that your life will probably be more fulfilling than if you had dedicated your life to an externally satisfying goal such as becoming a celebrity.  *For the sake of eliminating lurking variables please list if you've had children (and if they had mental or physical problems) and whether or not you were in a stable relationship and had a stable career.  If that isn't listed I will for the purpose of the debate assume you have no children.  If you list that you have children but nothing else, I will assume you were in an unstable relationship without stable well paying employment.*  **I am most interested to hear the reasoning of people who have stable careers and relationships who had mentally and physically sound children who regret the decision why.  I am trying to exclude all outliers and lurking variables to see if this is a sound general opinion.  While I am interested to hear ""I would have liked to do X first, but I wouldn't change it"" I am more interested to hear people who outright regret it.**  The converse of this is that if you have a child with a mental or physical problem, you are much more likely to be unhappy with children.  If you have an unstable life, you are much more likely to be unhappy with children.  And thus if you have children but these issues, it probably is not that your children don't make you happy, but rather circumstance or your personal issues which are making you ultimately unhappy.  Not the act of having a child itself.  Though a child could or probably does compound these issues.  **To be 100% clear.  The act of HAVING or NOT HAVING children is not selfish on either side.  All acts of humanity are selfish, I do not believe in altruism.  That is a separate discussion.  For the sake of this discussion we are all rationally selfish, no matter what choices you make in life. So this is not a discussion on ""not having children doesn't make me selfish.""**  I have formed this opinion from the observation that most people who have worked their way into a place in life where they have achieved some sort of extrinsic goal have done so at the expense of their family or they outright don't have children.    I myself have achieved limited material success in my life and also satisfied an extrinsic goal of mine (running a successful business).  I do certainly understand that achieving success requires a level of dedication that often excludes family.  In my case, that meant properly timing a child.  After achieving this limited material and extrinsic success and goal obtainment,   upon reflection I realized these things were far less important than my perception of what their importance would be.  I ultimately had to reject the fact that these were even noteworthy goals to have.  And that ultimately my relationship and family were orders of magnitude more important.  I am in a 9 year relationship this February.  We have a daughter and we both have stable careers.  The relationship has taken serious effort to remain stable, but I believe most or all relationships require this.  Since monogamy is inherently inhuman.  If we were unable to remain stable, I would have rejected the idea of having a child (with my partner).  If I was unstable in my career, I would have rejected the idea of having a child (until such a thing was possible).    People who have achieved political, social or material goals that don't' have children, can't really form an opinion on the topic.  They can be happy, but they don't know if having a child would make them happier and whether or not they would trade that success for their child. I have not met and rarely if ever see people who have both success and stability in their life mention they regret having children.  So when I meet people who say they don't want kids I assume they're either not ready, haven't yet realized that the goals they have in life externally imposed and not really important (a derogatory way to put this is that they're shallow or self centered, I prefer to state that they are immature.  Since I made the same error and could only correct that error after obtaining my life goals and realizing the mistake in assuming these values from the system.)  My observations and discussions with other parents have as of yet satisfied my opinion on the matter.  This also made me realize that the indoctrination that we go through is much much more powerful than I had thought.  To achieve one's ultimate goals in life and realize they are not the most ultimately satisfying thing in life, is sort of like figuring out the secret decoder ring.  After you do it you feel happy for a little bit, and then realize it's more like finding out you need to drink more Ovaltine. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;People that dedicate their lives to an external cause or purpose are satisfying extrinsically purposed goals.  People that dedicate their lives to their children are satisfying intrinsically purposed goals.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a wealthy, happily married, 35-year-old parent of a healthy and lovely 3-year-old, and I totally disagree with your viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What on earth makes our kids more &amp;quot;intrinsic&amp;quot; than other goals? The only goals you contrast parenthood with are (a) money and (b) celebrity; none of the child-free couples I know avoided kids for those reasons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was married 12 years before I had my daughter. I used that time to pursue my own (graduate) education, to work in human services, to live abroad for six years, to travel the world, and to enjoy my relationship with my husband. These pursuits weren&amp;#39;t shallow or immature; every one of them enriched my life and fulfilled my desire for a meaningful life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now my life is more focused on my kid than on helping others and exploring the world, but I don&amp;#39;t find my new goals to be any more &amp;quot;intrinsic&amp;quot; or in any way objectively worthier than my old goals and pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Overall I&amp;#39;d actually say parenthood hasn&amp;#39;t changed my ultimate goals much. I&amp;#39;d say my goal in life is to learn and experience as much of the world as I can, and to do what I can to make the world a better place. Trying to raise kids well is one way to try to make the world a better place, but the work I did overseas also made the world a better place. So having a kid didn&amp;#39;t give me either new goals or a better way to meet existing goals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am most interested to hear the reasoning of people who have stable careers and relationships who had mentally and physically sound children who regret the decision why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are days I&amp;#39;m happy I&amp;#39;m a parent, and there are days I regret having a kid. I miss my freedom. I miss travel. I miss spontaneity. You seem to think only unsuccessful or unstable people would regret kids, but it&amp;#39;s precisely the fact that my life was so fulfilling and enjoyable beforehand that makes me miss it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It sounds to me like having kids made you reexamine your priorities and realize your goals weren&amp;#39;t worthy ones. That&amp;#39;s fantastic. But then you leap to the conclusion that other childless people must also have unworthy goals, and that seems pretty groundless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;People that dedicate their lives to an external cause or purpose are satisfying extrinsically purposed goals. People that dedicate their lives to their children are satisfying intrinsically purposed goals. When you become a world class guitar player, you are satisfying goals that society has told you are important. When you raise a child successfully you are satisfying goals that are innate to your being. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is some of the most ignorant shit that I&amp;#39;ve ever read. You&amp;#39;re completely projecting your values onto someone else. What if guitar and the artful and skilled creation of music is someone&amp;#39;s goal? Where do you get off supposing that having a child is &lt;em&gt;innate&lt;/em&gt; to my being?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And thus if you have children but these issues, it probably is not that your children don&amp;#39;t make you happy, but rather circumstance or your personal issues which are making you ultimately unhappy. Not the act of having a child itself. Though a child could or probably does compound these issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Seriously, read some stories of people who have these issues. Their children do not make them happy. Some of them wish their children would just hurry up and die.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So when I meet people who say they don&amp;#39;t want kids I assume they&amp;#39;re either not ready, haven&amp;#39;t yet realized that the goals they have in life externally imposed and not really important (a derogatory way to put this is that they&amp;#39;re shallow or self centered, I prefer to state that they are immature. Since I made the same error and could only correct that error after obtaining my life goals and realizing the mistake in assuming these values from the system.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No, when you meet people who say they don&amp;#39;t want kids, you&amp;#39;re speaking with people who actually accept the fact that a child might be completely disabled, that you might find you do not have the long term mental hardiness required to successfully raise a child, that a child could horribly destabilize your relationship and your entire life. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re projecting your own feelings and experience onto the experience of other people. You say it right in your quote: &amp;quot;Since I made the same error...&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If kids are your intrinsic goal, cool, go for it. For me, &lt;em&gt;kids are an extrinsic goal&lt;/em&gt;. Perhaps if I fell in love with a woman who was gung ho and I thought she would make a good mother, I would have a kid. But I don&amp;#39;t want it. I guess I don&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want it, but the conditions whereby I end up with a child are so specific and coupled with my lack of inherent desire to meet those conditions, I don&amp;#39;t see it happening. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re speaking from this bubble world where everything works out perfectly. Sure, if I knew it wouldn&amp;#39;t change a relationship, if I knew the kid would come out totally healthy, and I knew that I mentally had what it takes to commit the next few decades of my life to raising a family, then yeah, of course it would make me happier. No shit, sherlock. That&amp;#39;s not the point. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
I believe that women's only hours at gyms are sexist and shouldn't exist CMV,In specific I attend a university where all students pay athletic fees in exchange for the use of school gym facilities. While I already think that this should be changed to an opt in/out system I am more interested in hearing reasons why women's only hours are defensible. This renders particular pieces of equiptment totally unavailable to male students (as they are only present in specific gyms) for hours during prime times throughout he day. So if one is  paying equal fees to all other students why is one not allowed equal access and how is this a good thing? Doesn't it simply perpetuate sexism?   EDIT: I appologize for the sentence where I use the term I. I am female and have taken advantage of these hours in the past I merely meant it to be sort of illustrative but it ended up being very unclear.  EDIT2: Hey all this post generated a ton of great discussion and showed me a lot of ways that my view lacked nuance. My view has definitely undergone some substantial change and I'll work on awarding delta's to those arguments. Thanks all!,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I agree that this is not ideal (and I don&amp;#39;t use the women only area at my gym at all), there are several good reasons that I can see for doing this. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One is a public health tactic. Women are much less likely than men to get sufficient exercise. Exercise is an important protective behaviour for good health. The presence of men in the gym is a barrier for some women for exercising. So having some times where women can exercise without men present is likely to lead to improved health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another is to provide a space for women whose cultural/religious beliefs mean that they can&amp;#39;t effectively exercise in the gym with men present (imagine working out in hijab). In multi-cultural societies, this has a place. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to work at an aquatic center that had women&amp;#39;s only hours once a week during which only female lifeguards would cover the pool. As it was explained to me, the primary purpose of these hours was to give Muslim and Orthodox women a place to swim without violating their religion. It was common for non-religious women to swim during these times because they felt more comfortable not having to swim in front of men. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what the rationale is at your gym.  I would argue that yes, the women&amp;#39;s only hours there may be sexist, but they also allow women to partake in an activity that would otherwise be prohibited to them during normal hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"CMV: If a politician and their supporters truly believe that what they preach is correct, then they have a moral obligation to use whatever powers in their means to enforce their policies.","I think that it should follow that politicians have a moral obligation to stay in/get into office by whatever means that they consider ""for the greater good"", which may include lying/tapping phones/rigging elections.  My basis for this follows as such: Let's split all politicians into two groups (assuming that all politicians have a main goal of beneitting the country):  (a) Politicians who ""know"" that what they preach will be beneficial to the country. (b) Politicians who ""think"" that what they preach will be beneficial to the country.  In scenario (a) where a person ""knows"" what they are proposing will be better for the country, surely they have a moral obligation to do whatever is possible to achieve power so that they can implement their ideas for the country as a whole.  If they were not to do this, then they would be knowingly making the country a worse place; hence why I would argue that they are morally obliged to lie/rig elections in order to make a country as great as possible.  Whilst in scenario (b) where a person only ""thinks"" that they have the best policies to run the country, then I believe that they should not be put into such a position of power over others when they are not entirely sure themselves over whether their policies will be successful.  In a hypothetical scenario, in ""Scandal"" (SEASON 2 SPOILER), the soon-to-be President Grant won the election because of his team rigging a voting machine in one county.  They did this seemingly in the belief that President Grant would do the country more good than his opponent. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVeeXiWjulo &lt;-- I would ignore the Texan's personal opinions and focus much more on the question he asks; if the other guys think Grant is ""the real deal"", then surely they must get involved.)  [Also just a quick side-note, when I say ""know"" and ""think"", I mean from the person's perspective, personally I do not believe that ""knowledge"" exists, I believe that we cannot ever know something absolutely but when I say ""know"", I am referring to other people absolutely believing, not necessarily whether it is true or not.] _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But I think even your qualified version of &amp;quot;know&amp;quot; candidates seems fishy to me. They&amp;#39;re almost by definition terrible candidates, as the strength of this belief seems to preclude the possibility of future evidence showing they were wrong. So in a sense, this sort of boils down to a discussion of what, if any, moral obligation a person has to correct their own ignorance. That could be a really interesting discussion, but I think there&amp;#39;s a simpler, more pragmatic argument to made that is more specific to politics / elections / etc.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ok, so to what I think your main point is, the politician who is considering cheating to win because he &amp;quot;knows&amp;quot; their policies are better has to be awfully careful. He or she has to consider the long term &lt;em&gt;cost&lt;/em&gt; of lying and cheating in an election. How much better are his policies? Does he decrease unemployment by a few percent or slightly raise the GDP? That&amp;#39;s a plus, but he&amp;#39;s also risking two things: loss of faith from the voters, and maybe even more dangerously, loss of trust from the opposing parties, who may resort to similar tactics in future elections. This particular well intentioned deception contributes to the erosion of the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even if that doesn&amp;#39;t happen, if you are caught, or even plausibly suspected, you also risk &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; undermining popular support for your own cause. If the narrative becomes you had to cheat to win, that looks really bad for you, your party, and your agenda.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you are assuming that you will never be caught, then we kind of steer back to the odd dilema I mentioned in the beginning, which is what&amp;#39;s the right way to judge the morality of delusional agents who&amp;#39;s perception of cause and effect don&amp;#39;t reflect reality?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;in &amp;quot;Scandal&amp;quot; (SEASON 2 SPOILER), the soon-to-be President Grant won the election because of his team rigging a voting machine in one county&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How&amp;#39;d that work out for everyone?

Of course, the hubris that leads a person to believe they know exactly what is best for their country will probably make them ignore that risk, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean they aren&amp;#39;t morally obliged to consider it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV:I feel that confidence is a primitive mindset that maintains ignorance.,"This viewpoint has most likely hurt me a lot more than it has helped me, so I'm hoping someone can change my view here.  I feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions. I also believe that this is reprehensible. Your ability to learn and be edified, I feel, is directly hindered by self-confidence.  In my experience, I have learned so much more by questioning what I already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself. I often find that the most effective means of approaching a situation is to consider as much about it as I can, and tentatively operate on what conclusions I do draw, but constantly questioning those conclusions until either they work for me or no longer hold water. I think that there is no such thing as overthinking, and that any situation can only ever be improved by careful consideration.  Consequently, I see people that display confidence in themselves and their beliefs as almost intentionally maintaining a blissful ignorance. I do see it as one thing to have a faith, and quite another to be a fanatic, but I do feel that the divide between those may be a question of confidence. It is also possible to speak with some measure of certainty about your interests and knowledge, but it is usually best, I feel, to be prepared to re-examine your perspectives on even fundamental beliefs at any moment.  These perspectives, I do not feel, have served me very well. I find myself despising confident people as they speak with pride about things they have never once questioned. I see people rewarded for never once considering the ramifications of their actions or words simply because they convey confidence. It seems that many use someone's confidence as a measure for how correct or successful they are, when if anything, to me, it conveys only willful ignorance. What am I missing? There are many more ways to be wrong than to be right, so surely it is more correct to assume you are wrong at almost all times.  In short, confidence inhibits learning, while self-doubt gives every opportunity for self-edification. People who display confidence are often ignorant or at least preventing themselves from learning more, while those that celebrate and reward confidence are actively enabling this primitive behavior.

CMV: Propane is better than Charcoal for grilling.,"**Propane is better than charcoal for a multitude of reasons.**   * It is easier to control the temperature.  * Propane can be easily stored in your grill.  You don't have to worry about it getting wet.  It doesn't take up an inordinate amount of space.  * It's better for the environment.  Charcoal requires dead trees.  The good charcoal (not the kingston bricks) is made by slowly burning a tree for hours releasing huge amounts of smoke and debris into the atmosphere.  * Many good grills are designed to be used with propane and it makes grilling easy for beginners.  * Charcoal takes much longer to light.  If you're using inst-light charcoal, grilling too early is actually very unhealthy.  You have to wait for all of the coals to be completely white, or else you'll be eating the fumes from the lighter fluid in the coals.  **Some of the arguments against propane are easily dispelled.  For instance:**   * ""It's more dangerous"".  It's just as dangerous as lighter fluid.  * ""Charcoal makes your steaks taste better""  If you want a nice smoked flavor you can throw a could of wood chips on a propane grill.  And if you're getting all of your flavor from the charcoal you're not seasoning correctly.  * ""Propane is more expensive"" That may be so but it's worth it.

However, charcoal produces a better steak.  It&amp;#39;s not just the smoke, either, it&amp;#39;s about temperature and the difference between convection and radiant heat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gas grills only get up to between 500 and 600 degrees Fahrenheit, some as low as 400, and most of the cooking is being done via convection - that is, heating up the air.  That&amp;#39;s not enough (on its own) for a good Maillard reaction, which means you can&amp;#39;t achieve the same texture and flavor.  With charcoal, you&amp;#39;re cooking hotter, and you&amp;#39;re cooking with a lot more radiant heat.  Boom, Maillard reaction deliciousness.  You can&amp;#39;t get that crisp on gas without overcooking it.  Some gas grills have cast-iron grates to absorb the heat and give you better searing, but it&amp;#39;s not the same.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Charcoal also gives you the flavor bonus of smoking, and it goes beyond the charcoal itself.  When you&amp;#39;re cooking over charcoal, every drip of grease and fat or sauce that cooks out of your meat drips onto the charcoal and is vaporized, adding to the smoke.  That doesn&amp;#39;t happen on gas, it just congeals in the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d argue that a gas grill is better than a charcoal grill for most people, but a charcoal grill offers a superior end product if you know what you&amp;#39;re doing and want to go through the hassle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;all of your points have nothing to do with the quality of the cooking of the food. its like &amp;quot;propane is stored more easily&amp;quot; its &amp;quot;better for the environment&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;charcol is more of a pain in the ass&amp;quot;. none of your points touch on the subject of cooking food which is the main purpose of what we are talking about FIRSTLY. SECONDLY. people use charcoal for cooking because you are cooking with &amp;quot;peripheral heat&amp;quot;, meaning, the charcoal gets hot, and cooks the food with the heat it gives off. (the smoke) this gives people the chance for smoking more easily. it controls the temperature much the same way a convection oven does. Flames under food will be more inconsistent because the temperature that you are reading is not the temperature that the food is being cooked at since the flame is usualy RIGHT under the meat or whatver. this overcooks food much more. it&amp;#39;s like cooking food TOO fast and TOO hot a tall times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: A person's citizenship should never be revoked, even if they travel to war zones like Syria.","After reading articles such as this (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/13/world/west-struggles-against-flow-to-war-zones.html) I saw a lot of comments about stripping those that travel to places like Syria of their citizenship forcing them to stay where they travel to.  It seems like a difficult position for the gov't and the worry that they'll come back to create trouble domestically is legitimate however citizenship is something that should never be revoked.  With the terrible event in Paris there is more voice towards nationalism.  This opens the real possibility of gov't legislation addressing everyone's concerns.

CMV: Posting nude pictures online is caused by a need for attention and not empowering,"Let me make this clear before I continue, I am not saying that people are not allowed to do what they like.  I don't care if people post nudes, I'm just saying that this is how I feel when I see people posting nudes.  Also, I don't mean to suggest that there is anything wrong with posting nudes.  Lastly, I have nothing wrong with nudity and am in fact a fan of nudity, I just don't understand exposing yourself to the entirety of the internet on a whim.  Whenever I see anyone, male or female, posting nude pictures on the internet, I immediately assume that they are somehow seeking attention.  Of course, that's the point, but I think that it must stem from some underlying need to get attention that they must either be lacking in some other part of their life, or simply need because that's their personality and that they feed off of attention.    Specifically in the case with women, many of my female friends, including my girlfriend (hence the throwaway) , have posted nudes and any time I ask them why, they somehow defend it with ""it makes me feel good.""  Of course, I ask them why it makes them feel good and most either don't have an answer or somehow deay it makes them feel empowered as a woman who is proud of her body.  I don't understand how posting images of yourself naked, often with the understanding that others will masturbate to you (/r/gonewild for example) is not empowering but instead a form of whoring yourself out in a sense.    So reddit, why do people post nudes?  I seriously can't grasp the concept in a way that justifies this action, and have come into conflict with female friends and my gf and would like to be able to see this from another angle.  Thanks in advance.  EDIT:  Thank you for all of the replies!  You guys pointed out some clearly fallacious opinions I had and also showed me a multitude of other views on the issue.  This is a very personal issue that only pertains to my own beliefs and not something I go around spouting to others.  This was a good learning experience for myself, so again thank you all.

One person can be incredibly confident with his/her private parts. Therefore, the person is eager to show off and get some attention.

It&amp;#39;s an empowering feeling to be so comfortable with yourself (endowed or not) that you are proud to post nude photos. The compliments feel great as well! In this sense, it is not done for attention. After all, most people choose to remain anonymous -so what attention are they really getting?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re also forgetting the tremendous amount of sexual energy that factors into posting nude photos. People enjoy browsing other&amp;#39;s nude photos, so they decide to contribute some of their own. It gives them pleasure to know that other people get pleasure by seeing the posted photos. Again, this is more empowering than attention-seeking. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#39;m sure many do it just for attention, I know for a fact that not everyone who posts nudes does so for attention. Some are just incredibly horny and in the process of masturbation and posting nude photos while masturbating is just one more masturbation &amp;quot;tool,&amp;quot; like vibrators and porn, that enhances masturbation and orgasm.

CMV:Racial pride is a part of the problem with racism.,"Being proud of your race causes a social divide which only increases racism as it tends to lead towards racial exclusion.   I do think that racial pride tends to lead to the thought process of racial superiority and as such is only part of the problem when it comes to racism.  Being proud should only come with an action, not with something you are born with. You shouldn't be proud that you are Asian, White, Black, or Hispanic. You should be proud of what you have done.   I am not saying that getting rid of racial pride will solve racism but I do think that it is part of the problem. Rejecting shame has nothing to do with having pride.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeixtYS-P3s  EDIT: So far my view has slightly changed. I still think that racial pride tends to lead to racism because it **tends** to lead to separatism and a sense of supremacy. I am starting to see that it may be needed in today's society though. Not that it is right or even a good thing, but I can see that it may be needed.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Those kinds of beliefs just seem to be delirious to me. Change my view.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

"CMV: If the Christian God does exist, he should not be worshiped.","Edit: RIP Inbox 283 comments, wtf  Also, yes I got the Adam and Eve thing wrong, I admit I fucked up, I'm not gonna change the original body of text.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Christian God of the bible (I will just refer to him as God for my laziness) is a horrible creature. He has killed the entire population of the world. He killed Adam and Eve for eating fruit that would give them knowledge and he is generally a horrible person. Forgetting the bible let's look at things that happen everyday.  Ebola, death, murders, disease, wars, birth defects, bullying, violent protests. The list goes on of horrible things that happen everyday. Surely an all powerful, omnipotent God like the one from the bible could stop these things? If he can, but doesn't want to, he should not be worshiped for he is a horrible thing, he let's 5 years olds with cancer die on a daily basis because he can't be bothered. Does he want to but can't? Then he shouldn't be worshiped as a God!   My second point should be disregarded as the bible says he is an omnipotent and all powerful God (or at least leans towards the fact that he is.)  While I agree that many people see God as all loving and the bible is only a metaphor I disagree. The bible is what the bible says.

Life will have challenges and suffering and it is not neccesarily bad for God to allow you to face them.

Its the result of free-will.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You also forget that to God, our lives on Earth is so miniscule compared to eternity. All of the pain and suffering in the world(much of it caused by humanity&amp;#39;s decisions) is nothing on his timescale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reason he SHOULD be worshipped, according to Christians, is that he provided a way, even though the sins of humanity, for humans to go to heaven.

CMV: Ad block will lead to the end of near-ubiquitous free website access.,"I am going to board a plane in a few minutes but just had something occur that sparked this post.   I know many people who use ad block, but I worry if adoption of ad block becomes too prevalent, online ads will be worthless to companies that pay for them. That means that content creators who used to depend on that revenue to live will be out of luck.   So many of the websites that I frequent are free - sports, news, webcomics, YouTube, reddit - because they fund themselves predominantly through ads.   If they are unable to sell ads, how will they fund themselves? By charging users. I don't see other options...  I would like to use ad block because I hate ads! But I like free access to most websites more than mind avoiding or looking at ads. So please, change my view ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, some sites will make less money. These will be sites like BuzzFeed etc where the goal is click bait and user farming (quantity over quality).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, we&amp;#39;ll see a rise in alternate forms of advertising. For example, it will be more and more common to see product placement (example: that car from Walking Dead), content advertising (example: old spice ads, or company blogs), and voluntary fundraising (example: reddit gold).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More sites might adopt a freemium model. For example: Pandora and Trello, where the features are free, yet they offer a paid option that makes a better experience for their top users.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: There are many options for websites to generate revenue then to &amp;quot;pay-wall&amp;quot; content and force paid models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, I work extensively with web and mobile, so I&amp;#39;m just going to say this.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Websites are cheap. Really cheap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A domain registration runs at 10$ a year. A shared host or cheap dedicated runs at 5$ a month, no problem, and can usually handle sub 50k uniques a month without too much trouble. A mid level dedicated runs at 100$ a month or so, and can often handle 100k page serves an hour. Costs scale up fairly dramatically after that, but otherwise... they&amp;#39;re cheap.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If adblock killed off all ads on the internet, and removed all ad revenue period, it would of course be a huge blow. However, it wouldn&amp;#39;t really reduce the amount of free websites. It&amp;#39;s far more likely it would just distribute users more evenly over websites. Large company websites are run predominantly off company revenue, and are not necessarily generating revenue themselves. Reddit runs in the red. So what would happen? Not tons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Large serving sites like youtube would almost certainly go down. If they didn&amp;#39;t, they&amp;#39;d probably be grabbed by major music or tv labels as a vehicle to push their own content predominantly. Sports sites would be largely unaffected - ad revenue is supporting revenue, not primary for them. News sites may or may not go down, depending. Things like New York Times would not. Sites like Kotaku or Verge would probably subsist on article payoffs from companies without too much trouble. Content farms like all those &amp;#39;10 things you need to Xxx for&amp;#39; would mostly die or paywall, thank god. Webcomics would be largely unaffected - free or cheap hosting is too easily available and webcomics with only a few exceptions are low traffic, and those exceptions can generally leverage many income streams other than ads (and do). Reddit? Reddit I have no idea, by all rights it should have died already.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In general, the web would see the fall of content farms and aggregate sites (who subsist on ad revenue primarily), and a number of large content community sites would also hit the dust or become commercialized. Sites dealing with extreme traffic of video, and to a lesser extent images would also take a huge hit and content sharing would become drastically more decentralized. Some small dross sites and bloggers that exist to push ads and affiliate links would die. Otherwise, probably not much effect.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to kill the free web via ads when literally every person connected to the net can host a small site off their home computer for less than 100$ a year, and often completely free.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"There is no excuse not to be vegetarian, and in light of the ecological benefits we have a moral obligation to change our diet to a vegetarian diet in the developed world asap CMV.","There is no excuse not to be vegetarian, and in light of the ecological benefits we have a moral obligation to change our diet to a vegetarian diet in the developed world asap CMV.  So I previously posted that there was no excuse not to be vegan, and I’ve had my view changed http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1uehgm/there_is_no_excuse_not_to_be_vegan_and_by_eating/. I think the difference in ecological footprint between vegan and veggie isn’t large enough to make the change from veggie to vegan, which some people would find difficult. For context I’ve gone vegan after 3 years as a veggie after being vegan from birth for most of my life, I didn’t realise that some people found avoiding animal products quite so genuinely difficult.  I still feel that changing your diet is a fairly easy thing to do (plus paying more attention to what you eat brings all kinds of health benefits) and that the trade off between an omnivorous diet and veggie is significant enough to make the switch worth while given how easy it is to do.  Other changes we can make to reduce our ecological footprints are much harder by comparison, for example switching from a car to a bike or public transport to get to work or changing to a green energy supplier like http://www.goodenergy.co.uk/ Is going to be more costly and harder to organise than eating Linda’s sausages.  I think there is an argument that people in the developing world can’t be so fussy about their diet, but then they don’t have the huge ecological footprint most of us do.  I understand there is an argument around “But I’m just one person, what is the point in just me changing?”, but then again it is very difficult to ask someone else to do something you are not prepared to do. If we’re going to tackle the problem of climate change then we need to start doing so as individuals first.  That said I was wrong before, change my view.  EDIT: Source on diets http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/food-carbon-footprint-diet  **Big Edit**  Okay so just to make things clear I am arguing that there is no excuse not to go vegetarian, not that there are not reasons why you might not want to. A desire for material goods is a reason to steal, it is not an excuse. Similarly meat tasting nice is a reason to eat meat, it is not an excuse. Given the significant benefits of going vegetarian I feel that the omnivore has an obligation to justify their diet in the developed world with a stronger argument that is it simply enjoyable. I’d go on about this more but I think that is a whole other kettle of fish.  The possible excuses given so far as I understand are   **One. Health**  I think for people with a medical condition that means a veggie diet is unsuitable they have a plausible excuse. Conditions which might make it difficult like herpes, being allergic or intolerant of soy or wheat, and having trouble absorbing iron give an individual a plausible excuse I feel.  http://jacknorrisrd.com/are-there-medical-conditions-requiring-animal-foods/   **Two. I buy organic / local meat**  I’ve not seen any sources showing that locally produce or organic meat provides a similarly reduced carbon/ecological footprint compared to a veggie or vegan diet. This might be a valid excuse but I’d love to see some sources, especially given ttoasty’s comments here (I’ll try and dig up the podcast)  http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1un1uh/there_is_no_excuse_not_to_be_vegetarian_and_in/cejsvem  **Three. It is to expensive to go veggie**  I’ve personally always found it cheaper, I given that the only thing meat is good for is protein and that lentils are a cheaper way of getting this I really doubt cost is a valid argument unless you’re a fussy eater. If your a fussy eater you should probably grow up and eat your fruit and veg, you’ll feel better for it in the long run and won’t ruin the planet for the people you care about in 50 years time. Here is some fellow doing the vegan thing on a shoe string.  http://www.veganmainstream.com/2010/09/02/eating-vegan-on-21-00-a-week-the-food-stamp-budget/  http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Budgetvegetarian.aspx  I do however get that for some people in the developing world a veggie or vegan diet just isn’t possible, I’m arguing that people like (most) of us redditors have no excuse not to be veggie. This all aside however girlinboots makes a good point about how difficult going veggie can be for those without access to the necessary resources  http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1un1uh/there_is_no_excuse_not_to_be_vegetarian_and_in/cejx99b  **Four. It is to difficult practically to go veggie**  I’m not so sure on this, it is a real ballache being vegan, I ate out today with people from work and it is like pulling teeth trying to establish what is vegan on the menu and you look like a tool. Veggie though, everywhere does a veggie option, even freaking McDonald’s do a veggie option.   Maybe this is where I need to check my privilege though, I’ve always been veggie. I’ve got to say though people moaning that they can’t cook veggie I’m sure you’re trolling, it’s dead easy.  **Five. We are designed to eat meat **  We aren’t designed to do anything, unless your some kind of religious nut who thinks God designed the universe in such a way that we can divine his divine plan from observing the world around us. This argument carries no weight whatsoever.  **Six. Some of us do live already with a sustainable footprint without being veggie.**  So the comments by BigcountryRon really made me think  http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1un1uh/there_is_no_excuse_not_to_be_vegetarian_and_in/cejthdc  I’m really not sure here, given that I’m pretty sure that husbandry is quite resource intensive I’m not sure you could have a reasonable ecological footprint while living in the developed world on an omnivorous diet. I guess overall this argument is very similar to argument number 2. Yet again I guess I’ll feel this argument is valid when I see some lovely boring data about how you can be omnivorous and sustainable. My gut tells me that ConcreteDandelion’s counter argument of there not being enough resources to let everyone live this type of life holds true.  **Seven. I’m Just going to or already have drastically reduce the amount of meat/red meat I eat.**  This is a strong kind of argument. The odd bit of meat isn’t terrible, I guess I personally like to have strict guidelines to stick to. I’m not the type to stop at a few drinks ever and feel I couldn’t do something that requires both strong self disciple and the ability to keep track of how many times I’ve done something a little naughty.  On a bit of a tangent I really enjoyed watching ‘fat, sick and nearly dead’ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o0pSnp0Xs8 and felt part of the reason that people did so well on the juice fast promoted by the film was that it was so restrictive. It’s easier to go “is that veggie yes/no” than “is that locally sourced yes/no, have I eaten much dairy/meat/eggs/fish today yes/no, will I want to have something that is non veggie later on and if so would I be better waiting till then”. I guess I just like very clear parameters.  Maybe the real solution is to go meat free for X days a week or X months a year or something like that for people.  **Eight. It’ll ruin the economy**  I’m not so sure this is an argument. I’m not sure how I feel about capitalism, it’s just a hard thing to define and a whole other massive debate, but one good thing about it I feel is how adaptive markets are. I think if a large number of people, say even 50% turned veggie this year it would overall be a positive thing. We would have some people loose their jobs, but others find new employment in growing or new sectors.   **Nine. It’s not down to me it’s down to the government to make me**  I saw this argument more in the vegan CMV I did a while ago but thought of it again when I saw futtbucked69‘s comments about smoking.  http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1un1uh/there_is_no_excuse_not_to_be_vegetarian_and_in/cejriul  I personally feel the parallels are very strong, smoking like eating meat in my opinion is very anti social but enjoyable and also an important cultural signifier of status. I love to smoke, although I’m trying to quit 100% which hasn’t happened in the past 10 years. I think without the smoking ban in public places I’d smoke tons more, and I’m glad of it overall. I also think that like cigs meat (and unhealthy foods) should come with warnings and shouldn’t be advertised, although that is a whole other tangent as we’re talking about individuals here.  I guess we could have a long discussion about the rights and responsibilities of the individual, but in my gut I feel that we’re all pretty similar in that we want to do the right thing not just for us but for the people around us we care about. Unless your a climate change denier you must acknowledge if you live in the developed world this is a problem we need to tackle urgently, beginning with us as individuals and then looking to the wider community and society to see what we can do.  **Ten. It is easier to do other things.**  Actually I didn’t see this so much in this CMV compared to the vegan one (although I’ve not gone over the comments with a fine tooth comb yet). Hexavibrongal pointed out that other areas in your life my well produce a lot more environmental impact.    http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1uehgm/there_is_no_excuse_not_to_be_vegan_and_by_eating/cehd86o  Maybe for redditors in the USA the best thing to do is to by a bicycle rather than a ton of lentils and give up the car. I’d still argue this is much harder than a change in diet though, and for most of us won’t bring about the same change. Similarly a move to a green energy provider like http://www.goodenergy.co.uk/ is just completely impossible for some people because of cost.  I think I’ve got most of the arguments there. I’ll try and reply to the comments now a little more directly. In closing a few sources I found on why veggie better.  http://www.ewg.org/meateatersguide/a-meat-eaters-guide-to-climate-change-health-what-you-eat-matters/climate-and-environmental-impacts/  http://imgur.com/BQiIk8V","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing a diet isn&amp;#39;t as easy as you make it out to be. Switching from meat to vegan/vegetarian foods can have a toll on your body with symptoms such as constipation, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting (all depending on severity of the changed diet of course). Now I don&amp;#39;t know about you, but being in a constant state of exhaustion and illness for a few weeks isn&amp;#39;t exactly easy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m anemic. I have tried to go vegetarian before and got extremely sick. The iron you can get from plant-based foods and supplements is NOT sufficient for a person who already suffers from iron deficiency. My doctor ordered me to increase the amount of red meat I was eating in order to help supplement the iron levels in my blood.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I reject the notion that I have a moral obligation to commit to a vegetarian diet at the expense of my own health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Dualism is a tenable position in philosophy of mind.,"One of the central issues in philosophy of mind is the mind-body problem, which asks how the mind and the body are related. In this thread, I'll defend the tenability of a position on the mind-body problem called dualism. I would like the main emphasis in this thread to be on the debate between dualism and materialism, although other theories of mind like panpsychism are welcome as well.  Dualism is the position that the mind is immaterial. There are two main kinds of dualism:  1. Substance dualism - This is the position that the mind is an immaterial thing distinct from the brain. This position is defended primarily by religious philosophers and has generally fallen out of favor in contemporary philosophy. Descartes is the philosopher most associated with this position, but it has modern defenders like Richard Swinburne.  2. Property dualism - This is the position that the mind is an immaterial property of the brain. This position is much more popular than substance dualism and is defended by secular philosophers like David Chalmers. (I think property dualism is more tenable than substance dualism.)  The most widely held competitor to dualism is materialism, which holds that the mind is material. There are a number of forms of materialism as well, ranging from the unsophisticated identity theory (mental states are identical to physical processes in the brain) to the more fashionable functionalism (mental states are identical to the functional roles of brain states in the system of brain states). Perhaps the most prominent defender of functionalism is Daniel Dennett.  I think that dualism is a tenable position in philosophy of mind - in other words, there is nothing obviously irrational about it, there are arguments for it that don't make any clear blunders, and a reasonable person could arrive at this conclusion. This is a very modest claim that I suspect even most materialist philosophers would accept.  I think there are two arguments that make it reasonable to be a dualist.  My first argument for dualism is that we have qualia. Qualia are subjective, private, first person experiences; they are ""what it is like"" to be in a certain state. If I look at a white wall in my room, there are photons registering in my eyes and chemical events going on in my brain, but there is also something it is like to be looking at the white wall, a white quale.  It is difficult to see how the qualia in my example could be identical to the chemical events going on in my brain, because we can always ask why any given chemical process is accompanied by qualia. To give another example, stimulation of the C-fibers is always accompanied by pain qualia, but it seems reasonable enough to ask why stimulation of the C-fibers has to be accompanied by qualia. I do not mean to imply that these questions have no answers. I am just saying that the fact that it is reasonable to ask them suggests that qualia are not literally identical to any physical event.  Chalmers brings this point out by means of his zombie thought experiment in his book *The Conscious Mind*. We can conceive of a world exactly like ours in every physical respect, but in which no one has any conscious experience (i.e., any qualia). Since we can conceive of a zombie world, it must be possible, and if it is possible, then qualia are not identical to physical processes.  Chalmers uses other thought experiments in his book as well. For example, we can conceive of someone who had exactly the same physical makeup as we do having inverted qualia (where we have a red quale, they have a green quale, etc.). This suggests, again, that qualia are not identical to physical events.  My second argument for dualism is that the mind has properties that a physical process cannot have, and physical processes have properties that the mind cannot have. A thought can be apt or witty, but a chemical process cannot. Again, a physical process can have a temperature or velocity, but a thought cannot. This suggests strongly that the mind is not a physical process.  So I think it's clear that dualism is a tenable position that a reasonable person could hold. I don't claim to know that it is true, but it deserves more respect than it often gets on Reddit and elsewhere on the internet.   To change my view about this, you will have to satisfactorily refute my arguments (not just brush them off as materialists are wont to do).  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

China's rapid and continuing economic growth demonstrate the clear superiority of the technocratic model. CMV.,"This post is motivated by news of the Chinese 3rd plenum, which took place yesterday.    http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-24770802  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-24922269  China has been growing at a breakneck pace since around 1980.  If you haven't seen the graphs, take a look:   [Chinese GDP growth over time](http://angieliang49.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/screen-shot-2013-01-25-at-12-26-01-pm1.jpg)  [Chinese vs US manufacturing](http://i.imgur.com/VN0dIIk.jpg)  China has experienced a rare thing in economics:  sustained growth over a long period of time.  While this growth slows some signs of showing, some slowing seems fairly normal as the country's economy matures.  Despite facing plenty of challenges, I think a key point continues to be the willingness of China's leadership and the capability of its government system to continually implement reforms as the situation develops.    While initially successful, Mao Zedong's policies had become increasingly insane and inefficient by his death in 1976.  His successor, Deng Xioping began to open up the Chinese economy, and by the 1990's the ""rise of China"" was really starting to get underway.  In response to slowing economic growth, in 1993 many state owned enterprises were reformed, and moves were made to shift the party ideology away from socialism and towards ""growth at all costs.""    In China, officials at all levels have GDP growth targets, which they are required to meet in order to keep their offices.  Vested interests are pushed aside to make way for important projects, and while this is controversial, the government simply ignores the angry conservative voices and continues forward.  Instead of elections, the party uses the world's most extensive system of opinion polls in order to interface with the public without the inefficiencies and incompetent leadership that comes out of a democratic process.  Target industries are given state support, allowing them to totally outcompete western competitors and break into new markets in Africa and Latin America.     Today, Chin has a wide range of still-antiquated policies, many of which are supported by vested interests.  Local governments can't issue municipal bonds, citizens can only receive public education in their home towns (Hukou system), and land is owned ""collectively,"" allowing it to be seized and sold by local governments, and preventing peasants from selling their land and using the money to move to the city.    Despite this, the government continues to take advice from government think tanks, whose membership is drawn from the ranks of the country's best and most intelligent economists.   The new five-year plan is rapid urbanization, and this means land reform and abolition of the Hukou.  China is even implementing environmental policies, with subsidies for electric cars.  Unlike many western governments, the Chinese communist party is actually willing to *change* inefficient policies.    In conclusion, compared to the idiotic punditry and political deadlock that we see in many western countries, China's government continues to make big reforms based on advice from the nation's academia.  In America, poorly conceived agricultural subsidies, needlessly oppressive penal laws, and failures to check regulatory capture are pretty much carved in stone.  Thanks to some released prisoners and ex-mafia enforcers living a swing state, we still have an irrational and destructive embargo on Cuba.  In the long run, a country that can't make intelligent decisions will never be able to compete with a country that does.  ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t actually disagree that an autocratic system can make decisions faster than a democratic one; it&amp;#39;s honestly one of the downfalls of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about the long run though, as you state:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the long run, a country that can&amp;#39;t make intelligent decisions will never be able to compete with a country that does.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Firstly, I think the assumption that a country like the US doesn&amp;#39;t make intelligent decisions is false, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be where it is if it didn&amp;#39;t. Politicians obviously advise business, think tanks and academics before making choices, it would be undemocratic to do otherwise - that is termed &amp;#39;making a decision in a vacuum&amp;#39; and is considered a dumb thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Secondly, I was actually quite disappointed by the recent plenum of the communist party primarily because it failed to address several issues that will effect the economic success of China in the long run. When China decided to open its economy up to market forces decades ago, it made sense to be an export driven player in what was becoming a globalized market. However for China to succeed in the future it needs to modernize and focus on growing the domestic market by empowering its consumers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You talked about granting more property rights to farmers/rural folk which is good, the government also decided to deregulate some investment vehicles (because quite frankly all those ghost towns are embarrassing), strengthen social security and create a more independent judiciary (as an aside: does that sound very technocratic to you?). What they didn&amp;#39;t touch on however were the biggest problems, quoting from an article here made this morning:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was no clear promise to reform China’s bloated, subsidized and over-protected state-owned enterprises, which are crowding out the more competitive private sector. Nor was there any serious discussion of reforming a financial system badly in need of more commercially oriented banks and liberalization. The fact is that Xi has dodged, at least so far, most of the reforms that require the political will to take on entrenched interests in the public sector. “The leaders still seem to emphasize stability over decisive actions,” wrote BofA Merrill Lynch strategist David Cui. “This has strengthened our opinion that many of the tough reforms…may prove difficult to implement.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They also refused to talk about government debt has practically doubled over the last 4 years. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My point is this. To compete with the USA and Europe, China needs to modernize, this is incredibly difficult to do because of the technocratic system, tendency to promote unity instead of innovation and rampant corruption (compare: &lt;a href=""http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2012/results/""&gt;http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2012/results/&lt;/a&gt;). Also, part of modernization of the economy will ultimately mean moving away from the nationalized economic model, thus reducing the power of government in the long run.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess it comes down to how you want to define the word &amp;quot;superiority&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If all that&amp;#39;s important to you is achieving the stated goal of &amp;#39;economic growth&amp;#39;, then yes, a technocratic approach would be &amp;#39;superior&amp;#39; in its effectiveness to other models. However, governments in the west aren&amp;#39;t always engaged in a political deadlock over a disagreement as to what the most effective model for economic development would be. Often times, there is a dispute on principle. In other words, do you believe that the ends justify the means? Does an autocratic, one-party state that pretends to be communist but is essentially a corporatist authoritarian regime unilaterally making decisions for the growth of its economy deserve to be called superior because the results are good? What about the story we all saw on the front page of reddit yesterday, where an 8 year-old girl (the youngest on record) was diagnosed with lung cancer from China&amp;#39;s pollution? How do the &amp;#39;side-effects&amp;#39; of China&amp;#39;s industrialization and rapid growth factor into your assessment of their model?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But perhaps more importantly, the reason why there is political deadlock and punditry in the U.S., regardless of the issue being argued over, is that we have a constitutional, democratic republic. This is important to many people, since it means that the government is answerable to the people, governed by rule of law that enforces the will of the majority, whilst mitigating the potential oppression by that majority by furnishing all the people with rights that protect the minorities as well. Whether or not the system is broken is debatable; whether or not the system even reflects what it is intended to be is also debatable. But we&amp;#39;re talking about what ought be the case, not what is the case. What is the superior &lt;em&gt;model&lt;/em&gt;? If that is the question, then you have a choice between a model that might be more effective but under which you are a subject, not a citizen, or a model which operates only by the authority of its own people. Unfortunately, &amp;quot;political deadlock&amp;quot; is a side-effect of democracy; eliminating that with autocratic rule isn&amp;#39;t exactly a solution I&amp;#39;d called &amp;#39;superior&amp;#39;. But that&amp;#39;s just me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"CMV: People who praise Android phones to deviate from the iPhone ""bandwagon/circle-jerk"" are in a bandwagon/circle-jerk themselves","I personally think it's interesting how people can get so caught up in bandwagons in the attempt to disassociate from one. Apple versus Samsung and Call of Duty versus Battlefield, even 9gag versus Reddit a while ago (?)... typically the same thing.  I notice that it starts with a bunch of people who call out Apple and praise Samsung for having more functional products, an argument that can have merit. But after this initial wave of people, a second wave of often bigoted teenagers (and adults, more often than not) espouse statements like ""Apple fanboy alert"" or ""ipoop mainstream and overpriced"", etc, you know what I mean.    So this ""follower"" wave of people who try to leave the ""mainstream bandwagon"" actually fall into this secondary mainstream bandwagon, which pretends to be pragmatic but just ends up being another circle-jerk and even going as far as to bash ""the ignorant"" when they've become pretty ignorant themselves. Obviously not everyone but particularly the many commenters on YouTube.  I share the same thoughts with Call Of Duty and Battlefield for those familiar; I'm a big fan of both CoD and BF but after a while, the hate talk towards CoD is IMO often undeserved, irrational, and personally annoying.   Examples: look at the comments of any Apple or CoD video on YouTube.   Back to topic, I'm not trying to trigger a phone vs phone debate; I've owned a Windows Phone and now an iPhone 5; I've used my friends' Android phones.

Instead of actually addressing the issues raised, you dismiss them as being part of some bandwagon so you don&amp;#39;t have to do any qualitative analysis of the argument.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If people are talking about Android vs iPhone... whether or not there&amp;#39;s any &amp;#39;circle-jerking&amp;#39; going on is based on what they&amp;#39;re actually saying.  If you bring up the subject of which phone has better resolution, or more software, or longer-lasting batteries, that&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;circle jerking&amp;quot; - that&amp;#39;s debating an issue.  If one person dismisses the other without considering the meat of their argument, then they might be the ones doing the jerking.  But not everyone discussing and debating things like hardware and software platforms is doing so to be a &amp;quot;team player.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are specific qualitative facts that can be discussed regarding different phone platforms.  If for example, you think having a removable storage device in your phone is important, then Android phones are superior.  That&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;circle jerking.&amp;quot;  It&amp;#39;s a fact.  If you like iTunes integration and Apples approach towards qualifying available software, that&amp;#39;s an Apple asset.  Another fact.  No bandwagon needed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As others have said, it&amp;#39;s a false equivalence to suggest that the Android camp is as unconditionally-passionate about their products as the Apple camp.  The fact is, Apple is approximately 2+ years behind Android technologically.  Features that have been staples of Android projects for years are just starting to trickle into Apple products and their fans are acting like it&amp;#39;s an amazing discovery.   Which makes Android people cringe and whine.  Android people tend to look at phones more on the basis of what they can do and not what brand they are.  Apple people tend to be more brand-loyal.  Apples and oranges.   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a Pro-Android and &amp;quot;Anti-iPhone&amp;quot; person myself. I&amp;#39;ll try to challenge your view, but maybe not the way you want it challenged. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have to start up by saying, yes, it is Android fandom/bandwagon. I&amp;#39;d disagree with the term circlejerk because I don&amp;#39;t really get off when someone says they like android as much as I get upset when someone claims the iPhone is a superior product. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;the many commenters on YouTube&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Almost all YouTube comments I see are intentional trolls or people trying to sound witty, I may be wrong if you&amp;#39;re looking at very small channels, but YouTube comment section is not a good place to find discussion. Reddit frontpage isn&amp;#39;t either (albeit slightly better than YT). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;CoD and BF&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a bit different here with iPhone vs &amp;quot;Android&amp;quot; because iOS is exclusive to the iPhone whereas Android phones have multiple manufacturers. There are internal discussions to be had within what you believe is a group of &amp;quot;circlejerkers&amp;quot; as to whether the Galaxy is better than the Xperia, for example. iPhone &amp;quot;fanboys&amp;quot; are always spoonfed the next iteration and have no CHOICE in what they want, this is upsetting to me, this is why I personally use Android and get upset when people defend iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr/&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a little preface up there; but to get to the point - &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;iPhone &amp;quot;fanboys&amp;quot; blindly follow their brand regardless of what Apple does to them. They&amp;#39;re usually paying for brand name as opposed to quality/power. $749 is the price of the phone if you do not have an upgrade or a new contract. That&amp;#39;s about the same approx cost as the Sony Xperia Z3. Let us compare the phones to see what you get. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; iPhone 6p - 8 MP / 1.2 MP (Front)&lt;br/&gt; Z3 - 20.7 MP / 2.2 MP (Front)  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; iPhone 6p - 2,915mAh &amp;quot;Non-removable Li-Po battery&amp;quot; (unsure, had to google, wasn&amp;#39;t listed on GSMArena)&lt;br/&gt; Z3 - Non-removable Li-Ion 3100 mAh battery&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; iPhone 6p - Dual-core 1.4 GHz Cyclone (ARM v8-based)&lt;br/&gt; Z3 - Quad-core 2.5 GHz Krait 400  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; iPhone 6p - 2GB&lt;br/&gt; Z3 - 3GB  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; iPhone 6p - 5.5&amp;quot; multitouch 16M colors 1080p&lt;br/&gt; Z3 - 5.2&amp;quot; multitouch 16M colors 1080p  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt; iPhone 6p - 16/64/128 GB with no expansion.&lt;br/&gt; Z3 - 16/32 GB with MicroSD expansion up to 128GB  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alerts/Ringtones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt; iPhone 6p - Vibration, proprietary ringtones&lt;br/&gt; Z3 - Vibration, mp3 ringtones  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are other features which differ, such as the Z3 supporting Java while iPhones don&amp;#39;t but that stops being major selling points. One &amp;quot;major&amp;quot; one for me is how data is transferred. I used to have an iPod and having to use iTunes to add new songs is WAY more annoying than just dragging and dropping into my music folder. That is personal preference, and I can see how some users may find iTunes to be a GOOD thing. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I was getting all of my specs from here:&lt;a href=""http://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_6_plus-6665.php""&gt; iPhone 6 Plus&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=""http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_z3-6539.php""&gt;Xperia Z3&lt;/a&gt; and the &amp;quot;Popularity&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Voting Results&amp;quot; show what I mean. iPhones are brand name products which are sold for &amp;quot;status&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s not like I was comparing the iPhone to a &amp;quot;cheap&amp;quot; alternative either. Sony is notoriously expensive for their TVs, Phones, and such too. It&amp;#39;s a brand-name within the &amp;quot;android side&amp;quot; so to speak, but it&amp;#39;s also forced to compete with other Android devices, and cannot cut too many corners. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://youtu.be/ZsxQxS0AdBY""&gt;This video&lt;/a&gt; of Beats by Dre (which was on Reddit maybe like last week) explains how iPhones (beats) are versus say, the Xperia line (audio technicas).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr/&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So to re-iterate my point. The iPhone &amp;quot;Fanboys&amp;quot; are always defending their phone like it&amp;#39;s an amazing piece of technology, that is where the problems lie. It&amp;#39;s not, it&amp;#39;s a very sub-par piece of technology filled with proprietary requirements (like their charger, and iTunes). It should be seen as a &amp;quot;brand name&amp;quot; phone. It&amp;#39;s a fashion accessory which you show off to people who don&amp;#39;t know anything other than what advertising has forced down their throats. It&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; to go with iPhones, but it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; to defend the product as a superior piece of technology iPhone users say that new android phones are too big, and then they get the 6 plus and say it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; they&amp;#39;re all over the place like politicians. I personally feel that the Android users you run into MIGHT be circlejerky at times, but overall, it&amp;#39;s users who are knowledgeable looking at people who are ignorant (yet blissful), and those knowledgeable users are being told by said ignorant users that their advanced technology is worse than the iPhone. It&amp;#39;s not intentionally circlejerky if the Android users are &amp;quot;right&amp;quot;, they&amp;#39;re not going out for upvotes or karma or whatever. They&amp;#39;re trying to educate but they suck at educating (I know I do).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: High school dress code should remain as strict as it is.,"**TIL how sexist the US dress code policies are.**  **There was a bit of a misunderstanding here. I was under the assumption that the dress codes were equal (for the most part, they are where I'm from) and didn't shit on women in the way that they do. I guess it's tough to argue a point that is dependent on geography.**  **I still think as long as the dress code is consistent between men and women, it's fine to be strict with it. I do not agree with the dress codes that are unequal in this aspect.**      Here she goes:  Girls are not sexual objects, but it is in a man's nature to be attracted to the opposite gender in a sexual way. For most males, the more revealing a woman is of her body, the more sexual stirrings they begin to experience.   Let's say the teacher is a male and a select few females, who are 16 years old (age of consent where I'm from), are wearing very skimpy clothing. This does not make them sluts or whores, or anything like that, but it does distract the male teacher *because it is in his nature* to be this way.  Now all the teacher can think about are these girls and can't keep his mind on the task at hand. The class suffers due to this and it is a lose-lose situation as the teacher cannot do his job. It is not necessarily the females' fault here, but it isn't completely the male's fault either.  If the schools require females and males (although, females have different triggers) to wear decent clothing that smother at least part of this urge, then no one suffers because of it.  By having a strict dress code, you eliminate the risk of having a ""situation"" between a male and female when the main goal is to educate, not reproduce.  Male's are genetically wired to spread our seed as much as possible. Sure, they are expected and required to control the execution of this urge when the other party is not interested, but the mere fact that the urge exists is enough to distract them from their goals.  Yes, the school is taking away the freedom of student's choice. But, the teachers aren't allowed to go up to the student and ask them out **ASSUMING HERE THAT THEY ARE OF AGE** because they must remain ""professional."" Why aren't the students required to be ""professional"" and dress ""appropriately?"" _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

They don&amp;#39;t have the same levels of hormones as teenage boys coursing through their veins and probably would rather have a nice cup of tea and a sit down, rather than being unable to prevent their loins from stirring...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am going to start by echoing another comment: the logical conclusion of this line of thinking is to put a burka on every woman and/or exclude them from the workplace entirely. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That being said, the basis of your argument is false. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You and me both remember how distracting it was to go through puberty. Teenage girls are attractive. In fact, from the perspective of any hormone-plagued young man in the prime of his young lust, almost &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; teenage girl was nigh irresistible in high school. But my grades did not suffer for it. And any loose correlation between sexual attraction and bad work ethic is just a desperate excuse. The same is true for teachers. These are grown adults. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here is something else grown adults are capable of doing. Going to the beach. When I&amp;#39;m at the beach the only shelter between my privates and the passing onlookers is a flimsy pair of swimming trunks. An erection would be embarrassing, to say the least, but according to your logic, a boner would be compulsory nonetheless. After all, a lot of women on the beach are wearing even less cloth than I am. If I am a slave to physiological imperatives, why am I capable of doing anything when attractive women are around? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I am not saying sexuality isn&amp;#39;t a major aspect of human existence. But this notion that hot women are somehow &amp;quot;distracting&amp;quot; is exactly the kind of fetishism that arises in a country (I am from the USA, where prudish thinking is an epidemic) that tends to repress sexual feelings to the point that they become pressurized and warped. Telling women to cover up would only exacerbate this process of sustaining a societal nudity-fear/nudity-fetish. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I hope my input was helpful and constructive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: I would also like to add that I DO NOT consider you a sexist for asking this question.

I think that people who eat Asian food with chopsticks in Western countries do that to show off. CMV,"Most Asian restaurants in Western countries allow their diners to pick between eating with Chopsicks and fork. I think that the ones that choose to eat with Chopsticks mainly do that for show off. While eating Sushi with Chopsticks can be considered more polite than grabbing it with bare hands, I do not believe that an individual who was raised eating with a fork can find Chopsticks as comfortable as a fork for eating rice or noodles. I also don't think that eating with Chopsticks makes the experience more authentic, because from what I've heard, Asian food in Western countries is the ""industrial fast-food"" version of the original recipes, so I think it's not authentic anyway.  **EDIT:** Some of the replies revolves around Sushi. As I stated, I find it makes sense to eat Sushi with Chopsticks rather than with bare hands. My opinion is mainly for other kind of dishes, such as rice and noodles. I also honstly didn't know anyone who uses Chopsticks at home.

Yeahh, you won&amp;#39;t be able to eat the food properly (because the fastfood is usually not made well and not as easy to eat with chopsticks) but that&amp;#39;s part of the fun.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the reason is not to show off, it&amp;#39;s to have fun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I can&amp;#39;t stand to eat rice with chopsticks because I suck at it and just can&amp;#39;t make it work, but using chopsticks is fun and different.

I&amp;#39;ve taken my toddlers to a eat before, in a place that gave them to &amp;quot;kids&amp;quot; version of chopsticks (rubber-banded together) and they loved it.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My main point here is that though there will always be douchebags out there, don&amp;#39;t let them cloud your view of the world.  You see what you want to see in people.  I choose to see chopsticks as fun and not a competition of who can pinch them together the best. Maybe you can too. . . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Cultural appropriation is not bad,"EDIT: Thanks all who responded with their informative posts which have changed my opinion quite significantly. I have gained a much better appreciation for the significance of actions and this is something I will continue to think about in the future. That said, I do believe that this issue should not be oversimplified, as there appears to be a lot of factors about whether something is harmful 'cultural appropriation' or respectful, and accusing people of racism is not usually the best way to open a conversation. Thanks again to everyone who responded who have given me the opportunity to heighten my knowledge and understanding.  ---   It appears to me that 'cultural appropriation' is an increasingly common term, both in its use and application. For clarity, when using the term, it seems to refer to 3 acts: 1. Acts which have negative historical connotations (e.g. blackface) 2. Acts which have special significance to a culture and cause harm when others undertake them as they are trivialised (e.g. Native American headdresses) 3. Acts which are simply associated with or started by another culture (e.g. wearing cornrows).  I understand #1 and #2. It is #3 that I have trouble with. In the last few weeks, I have seen criticism of people with cornrows, full lips, skeleton makeup, full eyeliner, twerking, hip-hop.   Firstly, I fail to see how this is truly harmful to people. There is a root of any trend, and I don't see how anyone can claim exclusive ownership of something just because it originated with them. Look at fashion and music; there is obvious 'appropriation' there and while some of the original artists may not appreciate it, for the most part they are not claiming personal hurt.   I have heard it argued that it is harmful because people 'want to look black, but not be black' in so much as people like Iggy Azalea will rap but then be notably absent at protests such as against the shooting of Trayvon Martin. However, my problem with this is - shouldn't we ALL care about these issues, regardless of whether or not we rap? It feels like a separate issue to me.  Secondly, some of these 'trends' didn't even exclusively originate with one group. Braids, for example, have been worn by many groups over many centuries. Relatedly, while I acknowledge the 'power' issue, it is worth noting that European/white culture seems completely immune to calls of cultural appropriation. If you take the line of argument that someone wearing something without understanding the cultural significance is harmful, then this should apply across the board. Yet no-one batted an eyelid when Chanel made Dutch Clogs a fashion item.  Thirdly, even if you do believe that cultural appropriation is wrong, it seems to be more misguided than racist. I believe to label anyone who wears cornrows as 'racist' is not only unfair, but trivialises the word. Race is an absolutely massive issue around the world, and I feel like focusing on Taylor Swift for pretending to twerk is just a non-issue comparatively and potentially undermining conversations we need to have. The honest truth is, I feel like I am starting to disengage with these conversations because it begins to feel like unless you are an expert in race issues in modern society, you're likely to be called a 'racist.'  I genuinely want to understand and 100% accept that my background of being a white female means I may not grasp the realities of this situation.

For instance, large lips have been mocked in many aspects of entertainment historically (particularly the 18th century), most notably minstrelsy and &amp;quot;black face&amp;quot;. There are also images drawn noting the differences in the facial features of blacks with comparison to whites, many of which exaggerate and mock the large lips, large noses, large rear-ends and &amp;quot;nappy hair&amp;quot; of blacks. (there is a particular image that comes to mind that has been widely used to illustrate this concept, but I cannot seem to find it). However, it seems that the very things that are mocked on black bodies, are praised on white bodies. In some instances, the very thing that is mocked on black bodies is praised as being &amp;quot;originated&amp;quot; by a given white individual. Black people have always had big lips. There is nothing inherently new about big lips. Kylie Jenner did not &amp;quot;start&amp;quot; big lips.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Basically, big lips, large asses, hip hop..none of these things BELONG to blacks. However, when they are deemed &amp;quot;less than&amp;quot; on black bodies, or &amp;quot;ghetto&amp;quot; in black society and then praised on white bodies or accepted by the greater white population just because they are being fed by a white person (see kylie jenner&amp;#39;s lips and iggy azalea&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;rapping&amp;quot;) there is an undercurrent of disrespect. It leaves blacks in a place of, &amp;quot;wait I thought big lips were funny? They&amp;#39;re &amp;#39;in&amp;#39; now? What changed?&amp;quot; Just under the surface there is the whole &amp;quot;they love being black but would hate being black&amp;quot; level of discourse that reinforces that your bodies are not ok, your BLACKNESS is not ok, and because of that Kylie Jenner&amp;#39;s big lips are beautiful because they are on a white body.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is just my interpretation of what the larger discourse is, I may be wrong, but I think if there was more respect for the originating culture, and/or less criticism for the same characteristics that are praised on white bodies, it would be less of an issue.  Basically if everyone stopped saying that iggy azalea brought big asses back and kylie jenner started big lips no one would have a problem. But as I&amp;#39;ve stated, I may be wrong...this is a large concept that has no real &amp;quot;answer&amp;quot; per se.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have heard it argued that it is harmful because people &amp;#39;want to look black, but not be black&amp;#39; in so much as people like Iggy Azalea will rap but then be notably absent at protests such as against the shooting of Trayvon Martin. However, my problem with this is - shouldn&amp;#39;t we ALL care about these issues, regardless of whether or not we rap? It feels like a separate issue to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yes, we should all care about those issues. However, we aren&amp;#39;t all making our livelihoods off of an art form invented by black people. Say an elderly person acted as a mentor to you and gave you opportunities throughout your life, but is now lonely and struggling to make ends meet. We should all care about the elderly, but isn&amp;#39;t it worse that you benefited so much from them and have now abandoned them? A lot of the rhetoric against cultural appropriation is based on calling out hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Braids, for example, have been worn by many groups over many centuries. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It depends what kind of braids/hairstyles we&amp;#39;re talking about. The big one I&amp;#39;ve seen is people arguing Celts invented dreadlocks, when Celtic dreadlocks look nothing like modern dreadlocks popularized by black people. Another issue is that black people are often &lt;a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/01/opinion/when-black-hair-is-against-the-rules.html?_r=0""&gt;pressured&lt;/a&gt; to change their hairstyles to fit in with mainstream (white-dominated) society. While the white people wearing cornrows probably aren&amp;#39;t the same white people making those types of regulations, it&amp;#39;s still frustrating for black people to see pieces of black culture become &amp;quot;trendy&amp;quot; in the hands of white people while black culture as practiced by black people is stigmatized.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thirdly, even if you do believe that cultural appropriation is wrong, it seems to be more misguided than racist. I believe to label anyone who wears cornrows as &amp;#39;racist&amp;#39; is not only unfair, but trivialises the word. Race is an absolutely massive issue around the world, and I feel like focusing on Taylor Swift for pretending to twerk is just a non-issue comparatively and potentially undermining conversations we need to have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think you can hold both these positions. Some cultural appropriation is worse than others in terms of the individual doing it, so it can be both misguided and racist. The bigger argument is that society, beyond the individual, is racist, and the individual action is simply a manifestation of societal racism (e.g. a white person is ignorant about a Native American headdress because they were never taught about its significance, whereas Native American people would know not to make a fashion statement out of a crucifix because of the dominance of white culture)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I agree that endless thinkpieces about the possibly-racist event of the week are annoying, but I don&amp;#39;t think they detract from real discussions about race. These articles may be someone&amp;#39;s first exposure to talking about race. If the puff pieces and clickbait weren&amp;#39;t about Taylor Swift twerking, they would probably be about her cat or her hair. If you&amp;#39;re cynical, writing about race makes more sense because it&amp;#39;s more controversial and will draw more clicks. I think a lot of journalists making these pieces genuinely believe in them, but wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily be writing &amp;quot;big issue&amp;quot; race articles in the absence of lower-level scandals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: I don't feel bad for men who lose HALF of ""their stuff"" in a divorce. I think they are idiots and bear full responsibility for what was, in effect, a stupid business decision.","I was reading this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2ft02u/men_who_dont_want_to_get_married_why/  Men are complaining that a woman would take HALF of ""their stuff"" (money, possessions, assets, etc) if there is a divorce - and so they are choosing not to get married because of that. And there are also posts from men who actually have lost half of ""their stuff"" to women in their own previous divorces. I don't feel bad about this, and I kind of think most of these men are idiots and deserve it.   The only way a man would lose HALF of ""his stuff"" (a debatable term, I agree, but I'll continue to use it here for simplicity) is if the man is earning 100% of the income in a marriage, and the woman is earning 0%. A marriage is a business partnership that is 50-50... so I can't help but think that men who marry unemployed and unemployable woman are idiots. It's comparable to starting a 50-50 business with my high-school buddy who is broke and has nothing to actually invest in the business... you'd have to be stupid to start a financial/business partnership in such circumstances. If I'm going to start a business with someone, I'd expect they contribute half, or at least close to half (eg 25% or more at the very least)... otherwise they have very little / nothing to lose, and I have more to lose than my ""fair share"".  Women make about 75% of what men make, no? (Correct me if I'm wrong.) So it shouldn't be too hard to find a potential wife that is at least in the same income bracket/range as the man, correct? A man who marries a woman so far outside his income bracket is comparable to a man who invests and starts a business with a homeless bum and expects to share the losses 50-50 if things go south. Why are men marrying women (in what seems like large numbers, based on the above-linked post), who have little to no earning ability? Why are they starting 50-50 business partnerships with them? Why is it so hard to find a wife that has a job? Is the jobless rate for women that high? Or are unemployed and uneducated women simply more attractive? Are employed women not considered ""marriage material""? WTF is going on?  I guess in short, **I think people should marry others who earn similar to themselves - and if they do otherwise, are knowingly and consentually doing so with the understanding that they are carrying most/all of the financial risk.** They shouldn't have a right to complain that they got ""finacially screwed"" when they consentually chose to be the only one to make a financial investment in their marriage.  Can someone help me see their side of the story, because I genuinely don't see it and don't get it. I have no sympathy at present. Please CMV.      _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It&amp;#39;s more okay for them to be upset about losing stuff, though, so that&amp;#39;s what they complain about.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s necessary to go to extremes like some of the responses here have to feel sympathy for men who have gone through a divorce.  Maybe they were very happy to marry a woman who makes less than them, or to have a spouse that quits working to look after their children.  They didn&amp;#39;t really think about the &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; aspect of marriage when things were good.  Then, something happens, and maybe it&amp;#39;s no-ones fault, but the marriage breaks up.  They have all the same feelings of hurt and disappointment, but don&amp;#39;t necessarily have the language to express it.  They look at their married life and see time spent at work, and think &amp;quot;I spent all that time earning money, and now I don&amp;#39;t even have that&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It takes a pretty big person to look at a failed relationship and say, &amp;quot;Well, we just weren&amp;#39;t compatible&amp;quot;, so I can understand wanting to get sympathy and maybe bash your ex to strangers.  And if you&amp;#39;ve been raised to not be emotionally vulnerable (which I think is still how we raise boys), then I can understand moving those emotions to the &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; aspect of marriage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other factors to consider, such as the cause of the divorce.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before we get to that though, let&amp;#39;s talk about the setting.  The hypothetical situation I&amp;#39;d like to present will be a couple with two kids, with the husband earning 100% of the pay, and the wife staying home to raise the kids.  They have a nice three bedroom house that he paid for, two cars, a retirement account, etc.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, the situation isn&amp;#39;t quite that simple, because the wife gets lazy, depressed, whatever so the husband has to cover more for taking care of the kids, cleaning the house, etc.  She starts drinking heavily because of her depression, and despite his attempts to get her to want to get help, she refuses and lashes out violently at him, even hitting him.  By this point, he&amp;#39;s basically a single dad with a roommate who lives in his house for free and helps with nothing but causes a lot of trouble for him and his children.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eventually, his wife decides she&amp;#39;s bored with her life, and starts meeting men online while her husband is at work and the kids are at school.  She sleeps with them, and picks up STDs and eventually gets into drugs as result of the quality of people she associates with.  One day, she decides she&amp;#39;s going to run off with one of those guys and abandons her children and husband.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She then files for divorce.  This is where my argument comes to play.  She has abandoned her children and she does drugs, which would make a strong argument in favor of the husband getting full custody.  This alone would mean that he should keep more of the money simply for the benefit of the children.  Additionally, she should not be able to lay claim to any of the house, since she contributed nothing to it, and it would benefit the children to not have to move to a bad neighborhood for a 50% cheaper house.  Also, should she be able to claim any of the retirement accounts or anything else that the husband paid for in good faith, considering it was her choice to leave her family in bad circumstances after living with them in bad circumstances?  In essence, she violated the contract to care for the kids, so he should not be liable for 50% of the possessions/money to go to her.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, on a human level, wouldn&amp;#39;t you feel bad for this family, and maybe feel like the woman is a bit of a bad person?  Wouldn&amp;#39;t you feel at least a little bit of sympathy for the man in this situation?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"I believe movies on imdb with more than 20 - 30 years should not be open for rating, CMV","I state this because I think movies in general are made/released in the context of their time and that people who see them decades in the future might not really understand them or their importance/quality.  I can give 2 examples: some years ago I saw Citizen kane for the first time, I understand as a movie being realeased in the time of musicals and westerns it must have been an amazing breath of fresh air, but decades away it's looks to me just as an ok movie, so I refrained from rating as it would be unfair to give it a relativelly slow rating.  Another example was the blues brothers: saw it weeks ago and thought it was mainly boring and childish, after seeing the reviews (and trying to understand the high rating) I realized at it's time with those actors, those cameos it must have been something great, just not from my actual point of view... (this could probably be said about most movies of the 80s)   SO basicly that's it: movies/tv shows should be judged in the context of their time and rating them decades in the future will result in unfair ratings.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone goes onto imdb to see how good a film is, knowing how good a film was to people 30 years ago isn&amp;#39;t going to help much. What is useful to them (and indeed would have been useful to you before you watched those films) is how much you, in the context of modern society, will enjoy those films. If a film has aged badly, this would be reflected in the ratings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps what would help would be two ratings, one that was given at the time, and one that can be constantly updated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if a movie got better ratings then than now, someone from today&amp;#39;s modern time still checks the rating to see if it&amp;#39;s good. No one today is in that time back then, so it&amp;#39;s inaccurate. And there are a lot of movies from years ago that are still good today despite context. Casablanca is old as fuck (1930s I think) and it&amp;#39;s still praised for its story. The Matrix (I know it&amp;#39;s only like 10 years old) at the time it came out  blew everyone&amp;#39;s mind cause it had all these special effects that no one has seen before. Today they&amp;#39;re just meh, because of the advancement of technology but everyone stills thinks the effects are cool and the story is awesome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: My mindset of ""time is money"" has made me miserable.","Setting:  I am currently a college student finishing up my last year. Age 22.  Background:  I am a typical Asian-American and I grew up in a traditional Asian family. My parents immigrated from Asia to give their children (me) a better future in America. Because of my parent's pressure wanting me to succeed and obtain a successful job with high income so that they can retire early, i have instilled a mindset that ""time is money"". Unused time means lost of potential money.  Problem: I started having this mindset near the middle of high-school. During that time I realize why am I wasting my time playing games? Why I am wasting my time hanging out with friends? I could be spending all of this time to further develop my skills and gain new experiences. In college, that mindset has hit me even harder. I see all of these college kids socializing, having fun, ""wasting away their time"" that could have been used to study or work or to do something productive.   As I grew older and learned more about what's available in the world, I decided that my interests and work ethics match me well for a Chief Technology Officer career. I like the science and technology side of how things work and I have done much R&amp;D research in college. I also like the business side, leadership skills, and challenges involved. Since I am already working as hard as a CTO, i thought this dream position would also fit me as well. I am considering a PhD as well since many CTOs do have it. But PhD students also work 70+ hrs a week so they can graduate on time.  Because I have been so heavily invested in this mindset, reality just hit me. I am incredibly tired, internally as well. I have not had any vacations in the past two years. During Christmas break, I stayed at school and worked on my projects. I worked as well during spring break. As soon as summer started, I started my internship. And as soon as my internship ended, I came back to school to continue working on my project.   This negative ""time is money"" mindset of mine also repelled a lot of friends. They want me to go out and have some fun, but I pessimistically reminded them that they are wasting their time having fun and could be doing something much more productive. So now I also feel quite lonely with not many friends to reach out to.  Not only that, but my social skills are lacking and I still have not had my first girlfriend or my first kiss yet at the age of 22. (I have tried to pursue girls actually, but my mindset was, I need to get a girlfriend so I can get this over with and continue focusing on my career which let to numerous downfalls.)  Now that I am reflecting, I have focused on my career so much that I gave up everything else in my life. It is really hard for me to swing out of this mindset that I have had for the past 7 years.  I am starting to think CTO is not something I want to do if it means sacrificing another 10 years down the road. I want to convert my mindset to live a working 9-5 life and come back home worry free to enjoy other aspects of life that I am currently missing out on.  I hope someone can help me. I feel so miserable right now although I'm not worried about my career options after I graduate.  Thanks so much!    **Update** Thank you everyone for helping me to clarify the problem with my current views. This is not something I can turn 180 on with a flick of a switch, but hopefully I can transition to a more balanced person because rewards and happiness can come in all types of form. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

First, &amp;quot;time is money&amp;quot; should really be &amp;quot;time is currency&amp;quot;. It shouldn&amp;#39;t be taken to mean that &amp;quot;time spend doing things that don&amp;#39;t earn you money -- even future money -- are wasted&amp;quot;. It is more basic than that: your time can be traded for things of value (to you).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The second tweak is to include the things of value to you in the concept. Sure, a successful future career is of value to you, but so is enjoyment of your time now. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you want to go all financial on the concept, what is the risk-adjusted current value of the future outcome of that hour you spend now, compared to the value of the time spent enjoying it now? Sure, if you spend &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your time playing games or socializing then the future might not be as great as you want it to be. But there&amp;#39;s diminishing returns. The difference between working on your future career 90% of the time versus 100% is very small compared to 0% versus 10%, even though it is the same amount of time. As long as you put in decent effort, that&amp;#39;s the bulk of the future value. Beyond that, your current value of enjoyment starts to exceed the current value of whatever more time you spend on your future careers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So spend you currency wisely on things of value to you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of that aside, social skills and the ability to enjoy things and bring enjoyment to others, and have people like spending time with you, are far more important to getting to the top (e.g., CTO) than technical skills. Always remember that Steve Jobs and Elon Musk didn&amp;#39;t succeed because of their technical abilities, or working non-stop; their success came from understanding people, and a lot of luck. Competency is just the entry fee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d see it more as &amp;quot;time has value&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;time is money.&amp;quot; It is a good thing indeed to respect your time and use it productively, but it&amp;#39;s neither true nor healthy to believe that the only productive use of time is toward your career. Things like relationships, vacations, playtime, hobbies -- these things require a lot of time investment and have low (or negative) financial returns, but I think you&amp;#39;re starting to realize that they can still have immense value.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would suggest you consciously spend your time on the areas you&amp;#39;re deficient in. Maybe take a year off. The professional skills you&amp;#39;ve developed and the career you&amp;#39;ve been working for &lt;em&gt;aren&amp;#39;t going anywhere&lt;/em&gt;, and will still be there when you need them!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I think that banning downvote brigades from ShitRedditSays is actively harmful to this site. CMV,"Reddit has a lot of *really goddamn shitty* anti-women views that while not universal are fairly common. One of the experiences I had going to university was that a lot of my worldviews were challenged very strongly and vocally, and more importantly I learned that some shit I believed in was so not okay that I shouldn't even articulate it unless I'm *really* prepared to defend it. When forced to defend casual statements that people called me out on, I was forced to re-evaluate my views and through this grew and matured as a person.  I can't help but notice that people who I interact with who are under 20 or so and frequent reddit enough to mention it in public for some reason seem to not only hold some pretty strongly anti-woman views (""feminism is evil"" without having a tiny grasp of what feminism is, the ""friendzone"" is a real thing and not an awful manipulative concept, etc.) which they can't even begin to articulate a defence of when called on. I think that tying opinions like this consequence-free to an anonymous internet points community does nothing more than validate these opinions without encouraging critical thinking about them at all, and that to a lot of younger members on this site they're lead to think that these extreme views are the norm and are acceptable.  I do think SRS goes overboard sometimes, I do think that there's an extent to which they miss that sometimes jokes do make fun of people and that's an uphill fight you'll never win. But I also have a huge problem with the idea that they should be totally hands off. Maybe if people want their internet points they should have to contend fairly with gangs of people who, oh, say, think joking about raping babies should be frowned upon in a public place. It's not a freedom of speech issue, it seems like the rule is set up for freedom from consequence of speech where the people who would normally most strongly object are already frequenting the same part of the site and thus most likely to be perceived as ""vote brigading"" and thus their voice is basically cut off.  edit: these downvotes are definitely changing my view.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What intrinsic value does making an opinion invisible with no discourse do? What will taking someone&amp;#39;s opinion and committing as many ad-hominem attacks as you can without addressing anything about the opinion itself accomplish?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re trying to say SRS is productive or the face of feminism. The thing is, even they don&amp;#39;t say that. They themselves call it a circlejerk, and ban those who go against it. That in itself isn&amp;#39;t even my problem with the place, as I get the need to vent frustrations. I&amp;#39;ll go over my issues with it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a run in with SRS before. And, believe it or not, I&amp;#39;m not going to say that they were wrong. That&amp;#39;s the thing that kind of made my opinion up about them - I was wrong in what I said, it came from a place of ignorance, and it was insensitive. But at the time of saying it I had absolutely no idea my opinion was wrong. I looked at the problem from a male point of view, and was missing some perspective on it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two things happened. I got downvote brigaded from SRS where they basically just rained downvotes on me and called me scum, and a young woman completely unaffiliated from SRS engaged me in a discussion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We went back and forth, she deconstructed my argument, made a strong argument for her side, and I gained the perspective I needed to come to a more informed conclusion. I admitted I was wrong, conceded my points, and thanked that person for their insight.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m quite an open minded person, I&amp;#39;m willing to change my opinion on just about anything when presented with a strong enough argument, and I learn best through back and forth discussion. SRS and that young woman basically had the same opinion, and they were right - I didn&amp;#39;t have the information necessary. Guess which one left me with a sour taste in my mouth with no change in opinion, and which one left me with a better understanding and a more well informed opinion? SRS isn&amp;#39;t productive, and I&amp;#39;d go as far as saying that in many cases it&amp;#39;s unproductive. It is not some random person&amp;#39;s job to educate those ignorant on these issues, you have no responsibility to, but at the same time it&amp;#39;s also not your job to belittle, condescend, and attack.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, for my second issue. I find the sub has a similar parallel to &lt;a href=""/r/atheism""&gt;/r/atheism&lt;/a&gt; in that its main function serves as a vent for pent up frustration, a safe place, not a place for serious discussion or productivity. The problem with SRS is that it attacks individuals, and does so with malicious intent. Whereas &lt;a href=""/r/atheism""&gt;/r/atheism&lt;/a&gt; can make fun of a public figure or a general religion, or a group of people, SRS attacks a username with a single person attached to it. I&amp;#39;ve heard claims that they&amp;#39;ve DoXed before as well, although I have no hard-proof of that. Basically when your venting comes at the expense of others that&amp;#39;s no longer harmless and is closer to bullying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) To quote CMV: &amp;quot;downvotes don&amp;#39;t change views.&amp;quot;  A downvote brigade doesn&amp;#39;t thoughtfully engage or attempt to change an underlying idea or prejudice, it just tries to yell really loud and drown out the speaker.  That&amp;#39;s unlikely to change anything for the better because the speaker will observe that they were brigaded and either ignore the supposed message or take it as a compliment.  It isn&amp;#39;t likely to change views within a subreddit because if the comment hasn&amp;#39;t already been called out or downvoted, the other readers probably share (or tolerate) the same view and will observe the same brigading and have the same reaction.  I would bet a paycheck that they entrench and harden more views than they change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) Everything can be funny to someone.  The worst things (like genocide, murder, rape) can be made funny in a certain context and to a certain audience. Context is generally what makes anything funny, offensive or both.  A dead baby joke made in a subreddit that caters to sick humor is a very different animal than the same joke made in a subreddit for grieving mothers.  The claim that any joke referring to an offensive subject made anywhere encourages or normalizes the offensive subject is without merit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) Many subreddits are &amp;quot;public&amp;quot; in the sense that a dinner at a restaurant is public.  Sure, anyone can listen in if they want, but the conversation is meant for those at the table.  SRS is effectively sending its minions out to restaurants looking for anything they find offensive, recording the conversation, bringing it back to SRS and then sending everyone to that table to annoy those in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4) Nobody polices them.  &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; decide what&amp;#39;s racist.  &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; decide what&amp;#39;s sexist.  &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; decide whether a comment is ____phobic.  Who the hell are they to make those determinations?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;5) They reinforce every negative stereotype of feminists.  They are generally unwilling to hear opposing points of view, arrogant, and make &amp;quot;jokes&amp;quot; about those whom they consider privileged that contain the same prejudicial sentiment and stereotyping that they will call others out for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;TLDR - They do more harm than good by a wide margin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: Smoking cigarettes is inconsiderate (almost) always and everywhere,"It has been known for decades that smoking causes cancer, even for the *passive* smokers (that is, people who breathe in the smoke created by *someone else* smoking a cigarette). Cigarette smoke is toxic and lethal.  * If you smoke at a bus stop or train station, you force all the other waiting passengers to breathe in your toxins. * If you smoke while just walking through a city, you force all passers-by to breathe in your toxins. * If you smoke in any closed room, including your own home, you force everyone to breathe in your toxins who visits later. Also your toxins will leave the room as soon as a door or window is opened. * If you smoke on your balcony, you force your toxins on anyone who might be standing on *their* balcony, or whose window might let in the smoke. * In summary, anywhere you smoke, you’re being inconsiderate to other people.  I can’t really think of any situation in which smoking is not inconsiderate. Maybe, just *maybe*, I might not mind you smoking in Antarctica. (The Sahara is not unpopulated enough. The Amazonian rainforest is also not unpopulated enough, and on top of that you could start a forest fire and that would be inconsiderate too.)  The following arguments are not going to change my view:  * “What I put in my body is up to me.” — Yes, it is, but you’re forcing *other people* to breathe it too, and *that’s* not OK. * “Once dissipated, the concentration of toxins is negligible.” — It’s not up to you to make that call for me. I do not want to breathe your toxins, and *I* decide at what concentration I say it’s fine for me. * “Smoking is hard to quit.” — This is true, and I have sympathy for smokers who are trapped in their addiction. Anyone wishing to quit smoking has my full moral support and admiration. Show your willingness to quit and I will help you through it. If you are unwilling to even try, or you claim that you’ve tried and given up, or you bring up any other lame excuse to continue doing it, then you are being inconsiderate. * “There are lots of other toxins, and some of them are in higher concentration than cigarette smoke.” — This is changing the subject. The subject is cigarette smoke. Just because we already have other toxins, doesn’t mean we have to add to them.  Change my view!  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you think smoking is bad and an individual smoker should not be able to smoke because minute amounts of toxins disperse into the general atmosphere, you should also be against all forms of transportation that involve burning gasoline and all forms of energy-generation that involve dispersing toxins into the atmosphere in some amount (including &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; energy because it takes &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; energy to make solar panels and dig the ores our of the ground that are needed to make batteries).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your whole argument is based on toxins, doesn&amp;#39;t it make it inconsiderate for me to drive a car that isn&amp;#39;t zero-emission?

I don't believe that the military should have different fitness standards for men and women. CMV,"The US army [requires](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/army/a/afpt.htm):               push-ups  sit-ups  2-mile run       men      40           50              16:36      women    17           50               23:06  What rational justification can there be for excluding a man from the military who can meet the female standards but not the male standards. If fitness requirements serve a functional military purpose, why should a man who can do only 20 push-ups in a minute be rejected while a woman at the same level would be adequately fit? If certain levels of fitness are required for the job, why should women get a handicap? Is the purpose of the fitness requirements to reward people who are relatively fit for their peer group or to serve functional goals?  ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we all know, military jobs often require no physical activity at all. If a particular military job involves a great deal of physical activity, the standards will be much higher. In general though, they want healthy, disciplined, physically fit people to be in the military, and the requirements are meant to exclude people who are not those things. Generally speaking, a man requires a much lower level of health, discipline, and fitness in order to reach the womens&amp;#39; standards than a woman does. The standards are just a proxy for &amp;quot;in shape,&amp;quot; and are in no way intended as a test of functional ability other than in the absolute broadest sense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that this rubs people&amp;#39;s hackles because the brain easily confuses fitness standards with military might. The problem is this is not the case.  Fitness standards are a basic notion of overall fitness. It perhaps at one point was something similar to the idea of firefighters, that any one firefighter, if called upon, could pull any other firefighter out of a burning building. It stands to reason then, that you would want to make the basic standards for a firefighter to be able to lift and carry 250 pounds (the most likely weight a firefighter and his gear would weight.) But in todays ever changing military, it is simply not necessary, nor is it wise to operate under the idea that any soldier at any moment could and would need to take the place of another. Psychological operations, networking, drones, smart-war tactics require much more variety in ability. This level of functional differentiation requires different skillsets. In the same way that we acknowledge that the Air Force requires more technical knowhow, we see different standards for physical fitness in the Air Force as we see in the Marines, where brute physical skill is more often necessary.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We also know that adding the diversity of ideas is one of the things that makes this country great, and our military is no exception. Similar to the idea that female police officers radically changed notions of interrogation with detectives and brought a fresh, nuanced perspective to the craft of detective work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, for the same reason that you shouldn&amp;#39;t be alarmed that a long distance runner would be a terrible strongman, so should you not be concerned about the fitness standards being different for men and women. The only thing that is important is that women remain physically fit within their ability level, so that their mind will be kept sharp (the point of fitness) and their body ready to react with purpose. Our military will always have plenty of strong men to do what strong men are called upon for, and having a diversity of skillsets and ideas that women will bring will only enhance our military might, not weaken it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: Throw pillows are only useful for aesthetic purposes.,"Throw pillows take up extra space on the couch and are useless, except for aesthetic reasons. I agree that a couch can look bare without them, but they are not practical because:  * If you want to sit where the throw pillow is, it makes you feel like the princess and the pea, since it only comforts the middle of your back. * They are bad for your posture. * They reduce the depth of the couch you can sit on  If you want to keep pillow(s) there for sleeping on, why leave them on the couch when you can put them away and save extra couch space? Obviously, if you have extra couch space and you're just using it as a place for storage, then it's fine, but it remains a problem whenever you have guests over because there is no longer enough couch space.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV Isreal is commiting genocide,"I think the killing of the palestinians in Isreal is taking the shapes of genocide.  By simply looking at the numbers of casualties on both sides, the casualties on the side of the palistinians massively outnumber the ones on the Isrealian side.  They don't seem to care if the people they kill are Hamas, it starts to look like they kill purely based on one criterium and that is if the person is from palistina.  If Hamas is using their own people as human shield like they say, it doesn't justify just wrecklessly kill them.

Just because Israel has a much stronger military in an armed conflict doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they are committing genocide.

"CMV: If a total catastrophic breakdown of society were to happen, liberals would be primarily useless.","Okay, read first before you have an aneurysm.   I am not referring to political liberals per se. I'm referring to anyone with **primarily** left leaning standards in many key issues. Take the social breakdown of your choice. Nuclear holocaust. Total destruction of computer network infrastructure, Race war. Zombie apocalypse. Alien invasion. Mass riots, Global genocide, superstorms, melted ice caps, famine, pestilence, plague, Revelations, Anything short of an ELE. If society broke down and we as a people were not mollycoddled in the safety of our computers, tablets, and cellphones, then there are certain groups of people who will either give up their ideals or they simply won't be able to make it post apocalypse.  1: **Gun control advocates:** You refuse to own a gun? To shoot another person? You won't be lasting long. Other survivors will have guns. Not everyone who survives will be nice. They will kill you for what you have. And what you have may be the only things keeping you alive. You will have a gun and you will kill or you will be dead.  2: ~~**Anti hunters~~/Vegans/Vegetarians:** You think you're going to live long enough for your victory garden to grow you a food supply? Not likely mate. Hunting and eating meat will be one of the biggest necessities for survival in the entire apocalypse. Partial CMV'd by /u/Sierra_Echo_Foxtrot  ~~3: **Socialists/Wealth redistributers:** You think just because money is gone that Capitalism will be dead? That everybody will happily share whatever they have? Not hardly. Barter and trade (as well as outright piracy) among survivor groups will be the standard.~~ **CMV'd by /u/MontiBurns  ~~4: **Pacifists:** Need I really elaborate? If you won't fight or kill, you will be dead in no time.~~ Unbelievably CMV'd by /u/jetpacksforall  5: **Cop/Soldier haters:**: Your internet snarkiness and protest signs won't be of much use to you now. However, a well trained cop or soldier will be quite the asset to have on your side.  ~~6: **Feminists:** Well, I have a feeling that you'll finally actually have that rape culture you're always going on about. Not that I think you'll get much joy out of finally being right. Overall, I think you're gonna have a bad time.~~ CMV'd by /u/Siiimo  ~~7: **Race baiters:** Nobody will be in the mood to be hearing the Al Sharptons or the Grand Wizard Cyclopses in the surviving world. People trying to instigate that kind of internal discord when everyone is just trying to scavenge their next meal will mysteriously not be coming back to the base camp after a hunting excursion.~~ CMV'd by /u/Siiimo  8: **Intellectual snobs/Logic mongers:** If you were to question your group leader's decisions and use phrases like ""strawman"" or ""fallacy of the middle"" then you are probably going to be shot in the face. Smarts and intelligence will be needed to survive, but intellectual arrogance will be a liability.   9: **Anti-Death Penalty Advocates:**What are you going to do with that loose cannon in your group? The rapist? The food thief? The captured enemy? Your moral high ground won't save you here.  ~~10: **Environmentalists:** I doubt you'll be hugging many trees post apocalypse. You'll be cutting them down with the rest of us for fire and shelter. You'll be eating whatever endangered species crosses your path. You'll either happily kill the last known Fuzzy Feathered Pipsquack Bird and stuff your coat with it's feathers or you'll freeze to death in the nuclear winter.~~ CMV'd by /u/ZanzaraEE  /u/Raintee97   Now I know that CMV users like to nitpick over word usage and minute details. I've done it myself. So lets avoid that particular line of attack. I don't operate in pure black and white. I understand shades of grey. **I know that not ALL liberals would be useless.** I know that not 100% ALL of any of the types of people listed wouldn't survive in some way. That's why I used ""primarily"" in the title. I also know that some of these types will survive if they were to give up or go against their ideals. (Pick up a gun, etc.) The overall point of the CMV is that those who cling to those leftist ideals won't *generally* survive long term. So I will not argue with you over semantics or word usage. (liberal, leftist, useless, etc) I think you're smart enough to argue the spirit of the CMV without resorting to that cliche.  I want someone to show me exactly how [somebody](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/008/067/COLLEGE-LIBERAL.jpg) who insists on clinging to these ideals would survive and be useful to the other survivors.  P.S. I wish I could include atheists and bible thumpers in this list but there are plenty of both who use guns and are/were trained soldiers, so I think they would have a better than average chance, so long as they kept their annoying opinions to themselves. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Such people would be likely to advocate for this approach. Sure, banishment isn&amp;#39;t exactly ideal, but stories where the banished person comes back with a vengeance are usually based on banishing someone who was actually an asset. Otherwise, where would they find friends to get back at you with?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: I don't think it's wrong for companies to outsource tech jobs to India or other similar countries.,"I used to work for an airline and grew to hate travel agencies that outsourced to India (Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, etc) because they were difficult to deal with. I completely get that they can be extremely frustrating, the quality can be less than they're worth, and when all is said and done, may not actually save a business as much as they think. However, I just started a job at an anesthesiologist billing office that uses a company in India to do their data entry (a LOT of anesthesiologists use our service so there's a lot of data entry) and it got me thinking that there's nothing actually wrong with outsourcing aside from just the potential poor quality, but my work really benefits from it and they do a good job.   The call centers I used to deal with at the airline would often try to hide the fact that they were outsourced. I don't think there should be a stigma. They provide a service at a lower cost. Why do I deserve a job more than Rahul, Priya, or Mahesh? If a company benefits from it, why not? But is there something I'm not seeing? CMV! I'm totally up for a change let's do it!   Edit: to clarify, I don't mean that I don't find it morally wrong. Morals don't have anything to do with it. I just mean that I don't think that a business owes anything to the country it operates in if that service can be provided elsewhere at a lower cost.   Edit 2: In regards to my original argument that I don't think there should be a stigma my view has changed in the following ways:   1-companies have been known to fire employees in order to outsource their jobs.   2-conditions of the outsourcing company can be very poor and unpredictable.   3-outsourcing takes away many entry level jobs that would help an employee get their foot in the door.   4-companies have been know to use unskilled workers to do skilled work in the name of saving money instead of actually talented skilled people. In other words, they're potentially slowing down technological advances so they can pay less for codes and systems that are bugged and written by people that don't know what they're doing and now they don't work properly.   Again it's not that I find these reasons necessarily wrong from a business standpoint. More from the perspective that I personally either find them shitty or distasteful therefore I can no longer say that I don't think there should be a stigma.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But in reality, they owe a lot more.  They owe for the economy that allows them to earn revenues, they owe for the society that allows them to have customers, they owe the government for having laws that protect them, and a whole host of other things that allow a company to do business within a society.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now what should they owe?  Well, I already mentioned the tax that pay for many of the things that allow a business to succeed, but they should also be responsible for providing jobs, so that people can not only consume their products/services, but also consumers for the other companies that are also providing consumers in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With global trade, there is an effort for trade to be even.  So that when countries trade, the jobs lost in one industry are gained in another.  But unfortunately, we aren&amp;#39;t always seeing that.

New York&amp;#39;s garment district was the biggest in the world.  Today, the majority of clothing is made in Bangladesh and other countries with very low quality of life.  This has resulted in cheaper clothing for Americans, but has come at the cost of lost jobs.  For the people of Bangladesh, it has mostly resulted in exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The global trade we see today, has only really been around since the end of World War II, before that most countries produced the majority of the things sold in their economies.  So in the grand scheme of things, it hasn&amp;#39;t been a long time, and we haven&amp;#39;t seen how the whole thing will play out.  But we have seen enough with certain industries to come up with an educated guess.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We already know that China doesn&amp;#39;t play fair.  It&amp;#39;s very difficult for foreigners to invest in China, yet China makes major investments throughout the world.  China unfairly keeps their currency undervalued, to make their exports look more desirable, while keeping imports to a minimum.  They also scoff at labour laws, human rights, and environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We have seen countries throughout Africa stripped of their natural resources by foreign companies that use bribery to gain access.

"CMV: To the extent that ISIL is dangerous to the middle east region , the name ""ISIL"" is more accurate and useful than ""ISIS"".","[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant) is a good history of the terrorist group in question.  The terrorist group which is now referred to in English primarily as either ""ISIL"" or ""ISIS"" uses Arabic as its primary language, so any English language name will be some sort of translation.  The original abbreviation ""ISIS"" stood for ""The Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham"".  ""Al-Sham"" is itself an Arabic term which can be translated as either ""greater Syria"" or ""the Levant"", the latter of which is why ""ISIL"" is also an accurate translation.  The problem is that in the English language media (radio, TV, newspapers, internet journalism), ""ISIS"" is translated as ""The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria"", which is not a particularly good translation, and it minimizes the international threat posed by the group.  The Levant actually covers a huge swath of the western Middle East, including **Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria**, and parts of **Egypt** and **Turkey**.  When media use the term ""ISIS"", they are effectively saying that the threat of this group is limited to the two countries: Iraq and Syria.  On the other hand, the term ""ISIL"" is slightly more accurate and also serves as a warning that this terrorist group poses a far more broad-based threat to the whole region.  Therefore, it is more accurate and useful to refer to the group as ""ISIL"" rather than ""ISIS"".  CMV.  .  **Edit 1:** I am an American who primarily consumes American and Canadian media.  I cannot speak to British, Australian, or other non-North-American news sources.  I apologize for any confusion.  **Edit 2:  My V has been C'd.**  /u/Goodlake and /u/KevinWestern have essentially combined their arguments to alter my view.  I now can see that ""ISIS"" is *equally* useful as ""ISIL"", though it is still marginally less accurate.  The two-punch combo was 1) that ""ISIS"" and ""ISIL"" are more like names than abbreviations now, and 2) that ""ISIS"" can still refer to al-Sham even if the mass media usually forgets that.  I want to thank everyone who participated, and I will continue to respond to comments as they appear (though not necessarily as quickly).","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Britain ISIS is always understood to refer to the Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria, which seems to fit your definition. But more importantly, nobody really cares about the difference between Syria and Greater Syria. We know ISIS wish to establish an Islamic caliphate across the Middle East, and they don&amp;#39;t seem all that fussy about conforming to existing borders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would technically be &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; accurate to refer to the group as the Islamic State or &amp;quot;IS,&amp;quot; since that&amp;#39;s the name the group itself has adopted (perhaps in recognition of the translation issues the prior name would cause!) and as such the one we should use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for accuracy, you may be right: ISIS implies Syria, which seems to be the product of a mistranslation and should therefore be avoided, despite our &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece""&gt;long&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea""&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany""&gt;proud&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland""&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan""&gt;ignoring&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt""&gt;locally-used&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco""&gt;names&lt;/a&gt;.

"CMV: I think ""live and let live"" and ""mind your own business"" will solve virtually all social issues. As long as no one is being harmed in any way, any individual should be allowed to do whatever he/she wants.","I think the title is self-explanatory. I grew up in a particular country in Southeast Asia known for its issues with racism, and if anyone has ever lived in Asia they'd know that if Asians and rednecks have one thing in common, it's their ridiculously racist mindsets. Obviously, this is a sweeping generalization that you should not take to heart. I've met some really nice rednecks living here in Texas, and I'm Asian myself. As such, I grew up among a lot of intolerance and racial/religious/whateverthefuck prejudice. It is through this that I realized most if not all the issues I faced were simply due to intolerance. Most kids just followed their parents' outlook of life without thinking about it for themselves. I've faced parents who disapproved a girl I was dating, and have faced disapproval from the parents of a girl I was romantically involved with, simply because her sister didn't like me and to this day I have no idea why. I've seen people get angry after finding out that a person they knew was gay. I know people who have been disowned by their parents because of school/relationship/religious issues. I've faced bullying due to my ethnicity. I have friends who have been in trouble with the law throughout their lives but are some of the most trustworthy people I know.  As such I've lived most of my life since my early teenage years with a ""live and let live"" and ""mind your own business"" philosophy. I don't know most of my friends' religious/political backgrounds until I get to know them really well(still don't know some of my best friends' political views), and it's not something I ever discuss with people.  I know of a couple men and women who are cheating on their SOs but I will not interfere because I don't know both parties well. Now obviously some of you will say this breaks the ""as long as no one is being harmed"" philosophy of it, but personally if it's not someone who affects my life, I feel there is no reason for me to interfere in their business. I don't see a valid reason for wasting my time on someone else's problems without a guaranteed good outcome. I've confronted a family member who was mistreating his kids but I wouldn't have done the same if he was simply cheating on his wife. I don't know any individual's SO any better than they do. For all I know my cheating friends are trying to get away from abusive SOs and finding happiness in someone else.  So CMV, I'd like some constructive criticism of my ideology. I made it clear that I will ""mind someone else's business"" if it involves someone who is undoubtedly being harmed and can't help themselves, but I'm not going to deal with someone else's problems if I don't know the whole story and a good solution. Trying to police the world is unwise. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

(i.e. slander can cause a person to get fired. Sometimes personalities clash and a person is fired without just cause)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What about instances where someone does not believe they are being harmed (this can be found in instances of domestic abuse)?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What about situations where harm is more nuanced and subtle? For instance, would you consider a homophobic person making flippant homophobic comments around a gay adolescent to be harmful?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have answers to these questions it will be difficult to discuss your views very thoroughly, so hopefully it provides some food for thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I believe children ages 0-4 are better off being cared for by a stay-at-home parent than being put into full-time daycare. Please CMV.,"Let me start by saying that I am a feminist and I respect a parent's decision to work or stay at home. And I understand that most families need both parents working to support themselves.  My mother was able to stay at home with me until I went to kindergarten. I feel I benefited from this experience immensely. My mother gave me lots of one-on-one attention and affection, as well as thoughtful educational experiences. I am able to vividly remember far back into my early childhood, which I believe is because of the memorable experiences I had. My mother went back to work after I enrolled in school full-time, and I respect her for this.  I don't have children yet, but I am engaged and at the stage of my life where I am planning my future family. I am almost done with school and about to enter into a career path where staying at home long-term will not be an option. I would like to raise my children as my mother did me, but I cannot afford it, so some form of daycare will be necessary.  The money I make from my job will benefit my future children, but I get upset thinking about how much better off my children might be if I could stay home and bond with them. I am also bothered by my view because I am opposed to rhetoric which pressures women into giving up their careers to be stay-at-home moms. Please change my view.  Edit: A couple more points: My fiance cannot leave his career either, and we will need the dual income to afford having kids, so him being a stay-at-home dad is not an option. Also, I see the value of socialization, but this could come from a very part-time preschool (maybe 3-4 hours per day), or play-dates. After all, starting in kindergarten a child will be socialized full-time for 13 years straight, at least.  I'm not sure there is anything I can do to change my situation. I just can't help but feel like it is a sad situation, and my children would be better off spending all of that time with either me or my fiance, rather than with daycare providers. Many of my colleagues have said that they don't understand what stay-at-home parents do all day, and I don't understand why they don't understand what kind of opportunities they are missing. It's not that I think anyone needs to leave their job, it's just that I see it as a sad situation.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;the ideal situation is for the child to be with 1+ adult to be giving your child one-on-one attention all day long, but very few people can afford that. That being said, there are good day cares. My sister sent her kids to one that only had about 6-7 children at a time, the woman did lots of activities with them, they played outside often, had healthy snacks/lunch, etc. It costs more than your average federally approved childcare facility, but she thought it was worth it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I worked at a daycare that received subsidies for low income families. There was 1 woman for every 5 babies, for every ~10 toddlers, for every dozen or so two year olds and the ratio just kept increasing with age. I would hesitate to send my child there, at least for more than a day or two a week. Full time daycare has its effects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;BUT the older you get the more this changes. After all, as soon as your kid turns five they&amp;#39;ll be in school for 8 hours a day where they are just one of many. For some children it&amp;#39;s a rough transition, in this case full time or part time day care can actually help with development. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OFTEN full time day cares are the worse option, but there are not just two options. A daycare that is appropriate for your lifestyle needs and the needs of your child could actually have some positive effects on your kids socialization. As long as you really check out your options and feel comfortable sending your kid there I don&amp;#39;t see too much harm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think most working moms will tell you that they were able to bond with their kids if they wanted to unless they were working on an oil rig. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Being a stay at home mom can be great- &lt;em&gt;if it&amp;#39;s something you are good at&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What do you need to do it well?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;an understanding of child development&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a facility in coming up with stimulating activities&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;the family income to provide security while not working&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;the ability to feel stimulated an fulfilled outside of a work environment&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those last two can be huge. It&amp;#39;s not good for a kid to be resented, even silently. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you do work, and get your kid into a good program you get: * Trained professionals * an appropriate curriculum and a wide range of toys to interact with * greater socialization  * &amp;#39;school readiness&amp;#39; skills&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are benefits each way, but what matters is that the time you do spend with the kid is positive and productive.

"CMV: Fiction that portrays vampires as burdened is off-base. For the most part, being a vampire would be awesome.","I doubt this will happen, but just to be safe:  possible **spoilers** for *What We Do In The Shadows* and probably any other vampire flick/book.  My friend and I watched WWDITS over the weekend, which is a mocumentary about life as a vampire in 2015 (it's awesome and you should see it.)  We ended up having a conversation about the merits of being a vampire.  In a lot of narratives, there's an attempt - almost a strain - to concoct some kind of personal or emotional dilemma the vampire faces (e.g., a reason for them to be unhappy.)  Maybe they miss their family or the sunlight. Similarly, people actively avoid becoming a vampire, even entirely without religious motivation; it's just taken as a given that vampirism is bad.  On the whole, though, being a vampire sounds awesome.  You get some mix of (or maybe even all of) the following:  - Super speed. - Super strength. - Hypnosis. - Shape-shifting. - Immortality. - A very small circle of weakness:  garlic, sunlight, religious iconography.  To be sure, there are some things that would suck.  Not being able to go out during the day would be frustrating but doable and one can get acclimated.  Having to kill people to get blood would be a hurdle,  but in this day in age you could probably find easy, voluntary access to blood (see:  blood banks, weirdos on Craigs list.)  You'd have an adjustment period when everyone you know starts to die, but I *do* think you'd get used to it and it would become a minor encumbrance in contrast to a lengthy list of pros (edit:  for those of you who have read Neil Gaiman's *Sandman,* I think his portrayal of a human being thrust into immortality is probably accurate.)  Immortality in particular seems like the biggest boon.  Lifetimes to invest and make money, try new jobs, specialize in different areas, meet new people, travel, etc.  Your food source is conceivably right at your finger tips and not exactly on their toes when it comes to the vampire predator.  If revealed, you might become marginalized (as seen in True Blood) but, if I'm being completely honest, I don't know why a super fast, super strong, immortal creature would care at all about what those people think.  More over, since you literally have all the time in the world, you can wait for political change to the extent you do care.  I can see two situations where it might suck:  - You get turned a really young kid or really old adult. - You get turned when you have just started a/are mid-family.  But these strike me as marginal.  I doubt vampires would go around changing children on purpose, and I do think people would get over their first families in the long-term, especially as they cyclically lose people in their lives.  It's possible I'm underestimating the extent to which grief can linger, but I don't think so.  I just don't see the point behind the ennui and morose for vampirism.  In the big picture, why are Bill (True Blood) and Edward (Twilight) so sad and brooding?  If the option existed, I'd almost certainly hope to become a vampire.  **EDIT:** I awarded a few deltas.  I'm not sure how much longer I'll be around (4:00 pm EST right now) but I'll try to respond to what I can when I get home later.  - A delta for /u/zevlovaci for [drawing comparisons](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3247v7/cmv_fiction_that_portrays_vampires_as_burdened_is/cq7sqqf?context=3) between specific characters' lamentations and modern day parallels (e.g., the way we complain about ""first world problems."")  - A delta for /u/DHCKris for the [""What about your soul"" argument](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3247v7/cmv_fiction_that_portrays_vampires_as_burdened_is/cq7t247?context=5), which is actually more potent than I originally realized, not being especially religious myself.  - A delta for /u/depricatedzero, who basically did a [taxonomy of vampire fiction](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3247v7/cmv_fiction_that_portrays_vampires_as_burdened_is/cq83e18?context=3) to illustrate how the cost/benefits of being a vampire can change based upon personality and characterization. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But presumably, if vampires were real, so would this idea of the immortal soul and heaven and all that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It obviously depends on the depiction of vampires. On of the depictions I liked most represents two of their major flaws well. Theses flaws work whether vampires are superman or not, which I think is interesting. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Firstly, they&amp;#39;re dead, so they can&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt;. They&amp;#39;re trapped in a permanent stasis where they&amp;#39;re constantly put in front of their own flaws without any possibility to ever change them. They&amp;#39;re permanently confronted to themselves and this self is slowly deteriorating into a unliving monster. Additionally, they&amp;#39;re gonna be like that forever, which is a problem in itself. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Secondly, they&amp;#39;re dead, so they can&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; stuff. The idea that super strength and what not is awesome only makes sense if you&amp;#39;re able to enjoy such power. In truth, you could describe vampires as entirely dominated by the need to feed and the fear to be destroyed. There&amp;#39;s nothing actually human about that. You&amp;#39;re empty. You&amp;#39;re a shell of your former self. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: The United States is by no metric the greatest country in the world.,"ISIS, which is more or less the same as Al Qaeda, is in the process of taking over Iraq. They've captured a bunch of US military weaponry like hummers and black hawk helicopters, and openly mock us about it on Twitter.  In other words, the United States just lost a war. The media won't tell you that, because it's too busy with Israel and the Kardashians, but don't get it confused. The United States spent 11 years fighting fundamentalist muslims in Iraq after 9/11, but then we gave up and left and the enemy we sought to eliminate is more powerful than when we arrived and running half the country. That's called losing.  Yet many still believe that the  US is the best (greatest or most successful or best place to live) country in the world. Is that true? Let's see. Our citizens are in more debt than anyone else, because our citizens pay massive amounts healthcare and education while citizens of other top tier countries don't. Our unemployment is at an all time high, because our big manufacturers have all moved overseas. We get less time off. There's more poverty, more murder, more homelessness, more incarceration here than in any other top tier countries. Every other weekend a depressed person goes on a mass anonymous killing spree. Our congress is corrupt. The only ""innovations"" we've made since the Steve Jobs era are novelties make it easier to be lazy, dumb and superficial. Even our artistic exports, our mainstream music and film, are increasingly ignored and unimportant on a global scale. And despite spending exponentially more than other countries on our military, we keep losing wars.  By no metric is the United States any longer the greatest country in the world. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

CMV:Bill Nye is not a scientist,"I had a little discussion/argument on /r/dataisbeautiful about whether or not Bill Nye is a scientist. I wanted to revisit that topic on this sub but let me preface this by saying I have no major issue with Bill Nye. One of the few problems I have with him is that he did claim to be a scientist. Other than that I think he's a great scientific educator and someone who can communicate science to the general public.     Having said that, I don't consider him a scientist. The standard definition of a scientist is someone uses the scientific method to address. In my opinion its unambiguous that he does not do this (but see below) so he does not qualify.   Here was some of the arguments I saw along with my counterpoint:  **""He's a scientist. On his show he creates hypotheses and then uses science to test these hypotheses""** - He's not actually testing any hypothesis. He's demonstrating scientific principles and teaching people what the scientific method entails (by going through its mock usage). There are no actual unknowns and he's not testing any real hypothesis. Discoveries will not be made on his show, nor does he try to attempt any discovery.  **""He's a scientist because he has a science degree/background""** - First off, I don't even agree that he a science degree. He has an engineering degree and engineering isn't science. But even if you disagree with me on that point its seems crazy to say that people are whatever their degree is. By that definition Mr. Bean is an electrical engineer, Jerry Bus (owner of the Lakers) was a chemist, and the Nobel prize winning Neuroscientist Eric Kandel is actually a historian. You are what you do, not what your degree says.  **""He's a scientist because he has made contributions to science. He works with numerous science advocacy/funding and helped design the sundial for the Mars rover""** - Raising funds and advocating for something does not cause you to become that thing. If he were doing the same work but for firefighters no one would think to say he is a firefighter. As for the sundial thing, people seem to think that its some advanced piece of equipment necessary for the function of the rover. Its just a regular old sundial and is based off images submitted by children and contains messages for future explorers. Its purpose was symbolic, not technical. He was also part of a team so we don't know what exactly he did but given the simplicity of this device this role couldn't involve more than basic *engineering* (again not science)  **""One definition of science is someone that is learned in science, therefore he is a scientist""**- I know that this going to seem like a cop out but I'm going to have to disagree with the dictionary on this one. As someone who definitely is a scientist, I can't agree with a definition of scientist that does not distinguish between the generator and the consumer of knowledge. Its also problematic because the line separating learned vs. unlearned is very vague (are high school students learned in biology? Do you become more and more of scientist as you learn more?) whereas there seems to be a pretty sharp line separating people whose profession is to use the scientific method to address question for which the answers are unknown and those who do not.  EDIT: I keep seeing the argument that science and engineering are one and the same or at least they can get blurry. First off, I don't think any engineer or scientist would argue that they're one and the same. They have totally different approaches. [Here](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/29115/title/Scientists-vs--Engineers/) is a nice article that brings up some of the key differences. Second, while there is some research that could be said to blur the lines between the two, Bill Nye's engineering did not fall into this category. He did not publish any scientific articles, so unless he produced knowledge and decided not to share it with anyone, he is unambiguously NOT a scientist._____   &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you&amp;#39;re open in other areas, please let us know what they are.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let me suggest one other idea.  There are descriptors that can describe a person based on their outlook and approach to life, apart from their career.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A cynic approaches everything skeptically and looks to see who&amp;#39;s going to benefit.  An optimist looks for the good in any situation.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Someone who has scientific training may approach life by applying the scientific method to their circumstances - or even just ensuring that it has been followed before they believe a claim.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If I read some idiotic claim on reddit (I know, unlikely, but stay with me here) and instead of blindly accepting it, I look for the source, read the paper it quotes, consider the methodology used and the potential flaws, that is acting in a scientific manner.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If my kid asks whether x or y will freeze sooner, and we devise an experiment to test it, that&amp;#39;s doing science, even though no one would publish a paper on the relative freezing points of Tang vs OJ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I know your concern is that it cheapens the word &amp;quot;scientist&amp;quot; when these schlubs get lumped in with hardcore research scientists like you and your colleagues.  The same thing happens when a dork who plays guitar in his friend&amp;#39;s basement calls himself a &amp;quot;musician&amp;quot; when compared to a classical violinist who practices 8 hours per day.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think what is frustrating many of the posters here is that the violinist should find joy in the love of music shared with the guitarist, and you with those who share a love of science.  Instead, you&amp;#39;re trying to draw a line to say who is worthy of the title of &amp;quot;scientist&amp;quot;.  Bill Nye brought millions to love and respect science and the scientific method.  Yet, he&amp;#39;s not good enough for you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps you need to redefine your &amp;quot;professional scientists&amp;quot;, so that you have a term for those who meet your standards.  For most others, Bill clearly fits the description of &amp;quot;scientist&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this might be a case of semantics and in my experience that makes is somewhat subjective.&lt;br/&gt; My favorite mental exercise exploring semantics is to consider the question from a different latitude, longitude, or time. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You used Newton as an example, if you were to travel back and time and tell Newton you were a Scientist or he was a Scientist, I think he would be puzzled and likely consider himself an alchemist or philosopher.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you were to travel to Germany and declare Bill Nye to be a Wissenschaftler, which I take is the closest equivalent concept to Scientist, they would probably agree with you as it&amp;#39;s a bit of a different concept.    &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is Bill Nye someone who practices the Scientific Method researching Natural Phenomena&amp;quot; I would say nope, I don&amp;#39;t think so though I don&amp;#39;t follow him around so I can&amp;#39;t be sure.&lt;br/&gt; If you asked me if Bill Nye is a Scientist then I would say yes I think so. He&amp;#39;s definitely a science guy and first to come to mind when it comes to propagating the scientific method. Also other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It just feels to me like if your concept relies on someone standing in a certain place (North America) at a certain time (21st century) in a certain language (English) then it has some wiggle room or you need to fully outline a concept with hard lines and where to draw them instead of just using one word, and I think most people will agree whether your definition applies. (Just not the original word)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also I while I&amp;#39;m inclined to agree with you regarding Scientist vs Engineer,  My Title is Engineer, my Degree is Computer Science... so I always thought of it as a branch of Science.... but would never call myself a Scientist.

CMV: Sexual jealousy is manmade.,"Why is sex with someone else a cheating standard?   The answer I get from people is ""because you're breaking the trust"". And I understand that, but why is sexual exclusivity part of the general trust agreeement?  Other people tell me ""because its better when you love the person"". But that doesn't make it wrong, does it?  Other people say ""because it is the only thing that separates a friend from a lover"". Well if your difference between a friend and a lover is the sex, you either have the most awesome friendships ever or very crappy relationships.   I looked up if there was any psychological research to back sexual jealousy as innate and could not find anything. If any, I found [this TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/christopher_ryan_are_we_designed_to_be_sexual_omnivores) from a guy who claims, to sum it up quickly, that humans used sex as a bonding tool and there was no sexual jealousy before, and that only with the invention of agriculture we started to treat women as property and forced monogamy to ensure that our kids would be in fact our kids.  So it seems to me that men invented sexual jealousy to be sure who your kids are, and since then we've hung on to this manmade ""principle"". CMV!  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I (reluctantly) believe that pitbulls are inherently dangerous animals. CMV,"When you consider how the majority of dog attacks are by pitbulls and that the vast majority of attacks on small children are unprovoked, I feel it is difficult to argue that pitbulls are not predispositioned towards extreme violence.  Using newspaper articles, the CDC was able to obtain breed ""identifications"" for 238 of the 327 cases of fatal dog attacks; of which ""pit bull terrier"" or mixes thereof were reportedly involved in 76 cases. The breed with the next-highest number of attributed fatalities was the Rottweiler and mixes thereof, with 44 fatalities.[10]  Pit bulls have constituted approximately 2% of the dogs in the U.S., and a 9-year (1979–88) review of fatal dog attacks in the U.S. determined that pit bulls were implicated in 42% of the attacks in which breed was recorded.  I know many pitbull owners argue that attacks are instigated by formerly abused dogs.  Firstly, I'm not entirely convinced that abuse always produces violence (anecdotally, I know about three formerly abused dogs who are all readily submissive and prone to flinching, not aggression).  Secondly, how do they know this?  No matter what the context, many comments on news articles about pitbull attacks involves some owner condemning the actions of either the victim (""the parents should've been watching!"") or the owner (""what an idiot, I would never do that!"").  It just seems to be one giant just world fallacy.  I've never seen any statistical data into pitbull cases proving that a majority of lethal pitbulls were abused.  I'm not entirely sure what I feel the solution should be.  Maybe pitbull owners should be required to muzzle their dogs whenever they leave their property?  What happens to dog owners whose dogs attack others?  I hear about pit bull owners being sued, but why shouldn't this be a criminal offence?  EDIT: My conclusion:  Firstly, I'm seriously impressed by how awesome these comments are.  This is easily my new favourite subreddit.  I still believe that certain dog breeds are more aggressive than others, but I changed by view and think that other factors are more significant than breed.  [This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ditdn/i_reluctantly_believe_that_pitbulls_are/c9r0krj) in particular really focused on things like  reproductive status, sex, age, and socialization.  Many other posters have mentioned that criminals and anti social people are more likely to own pitbulls.  These people are probably less educated, and are therefore more likely to buy their pitbull based on the stereotype of their aggression and lack the means to properly care for their pet.  All of these other factors appear to take precedent over breed.  [I do not think that pit bulls are the most dangerous dog breeds anymore](http://defendpitbulls.com/pit-bull-attack-statistics/), at least in terms of which dog attacks people the most.  However, a few users have mentioned that the issue is not the frequency of pitbull attacks, but the severity of them.  Because of the severity (not frequency) of pitbull attacks, the jury is still out for me on the issue of legislation.  As for legislation, [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ditdn/i_reluctantly_believe_that_pitbulls_are/c9qukpg) provided a lot of great links to organizations that argue against legislation.  In particular, [this link to the Humane Society](http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/breed-specific-legislation/fact_sheets/breed-specific-legislation-flaws.html) was helpful.  Some reasons why breed specific legislation doesn't work include the difficulty in identifying breeds, something that Isabelle50 also brought up.  Maybe it hasn't changed my view, but it's definitely muddled it.  With that said, the Humane Society argues that breed specific legislation does not work, which is false.  [This website](http://www.dogsbite.org/dangerous-dogs-pit-bull-faq.php) very clearly established that breed specific legislation does work.  Mind you, ""breed specific legislation"" is a very broad term.  I now believe that owners are the most important factor - so if we can improve the quality of owners than the severity and frequency of pitbull attacks should go down.  Instead of putting chips or banning these dogs completely, I think that mandatory spaying/neutering or specific breed licenses would work fine.  In Canada, for example, people who want to legally own guns need to attend a safety course to get their license.  I see no reason why that wouldn't work with dog breeds.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;... the majority of dog attacks are by pitbulls ...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is only true in the United States. Here are statistics from different countries that indicate otherwise:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2387261/""&gt;A study by the University of Manitoba&lt;/a&gt; indicates that fatalities attributable to pit bull attacks happen about 10 times less frequently in Canada than in the USA despite that per capita dog and pit bull populations are about the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Australia, &lt;a href=""http://www.dlg.nsw.gov.au/dlg/dlghome/documents/Information/Council%20Reports%20of%20Dog%20Attacks%20in%20NSW%202010-11.pdf""&gt;the annual report for 2010/2011&lt;/a&gt; of dog attacks in New South Wales indicates that pits &amp;amp; pit mixes make up 8% of the dog population and 21% of attacks. In other words, the Aussie pit bull population is about twice that of the U.S. but pit bull attacks occur about three times less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Germany prior to the breed bans enacted in 2006, pit bulls made up 5% of their dog population (source: &lt;a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/biz6/dogholocaust/ourdogs5.html""&gt;German Fighting Dog Laws Update&lt;/a&gt;) and accounted for 16% of attacks resulting in injury (source: &lt;a href=""http://www.goodnewsforpets.com/Articles.asp?ID=113""&gt;Dog Attacks in Germany Incite Breed Specific Legislation&lt;/a&gt;), i.e., about four times less frequent than the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As you would expect based on these statistics, other breeds (Huskies, Mastiffs, German Shepherds) top the lists of dog attacks in those other countries. These statistics from other countries seem to indicate that &lt;strong&gt;there are other factors at play besides breed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;... the CDC was able to obtain breed &amp;quot;identifications&amp;quot; ... &amp;quot;pit bull terrier&amp;quot; or mixes thereof were reportedly involved in 76 cases ...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yes, the &lt;a href=""http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/1979-1998-breeds-dogs-involved-in-fatal-human-attacks-us.pdf""&gt;CDC study&lt;/a&gt; does indeed indicate that pits &amp;amp; rotts topped the list of fatal dog attacks for the 20-year period 1979-98. However when broken down year by year, the authors note that pits &amp;amp; rotts accounted for the most fatalities only in the last two years 1997-98 and that various other breeds dominated the statistics in prior years, e.g., German Shepherds from 1975 to 1980 (pg. 839, 2nd column, 1st paragraph). The authors conclude that &lt;strong&gt;fatality statistics are probably more attributable to other factors such as reproductive status, sex, age, socialization, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Imho pit bulls account for more attacks in the U.S. not because they are inherently dangerous animals but because there is a larger fraction of owners who choose to keep them intact and/or unsocialized. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) reports that 70%-76% of attacks that resulted in injury in the U.S. were by intact males (&lt;a href=""https://www.avma.org/public/Health/Documents/dogbite.pdf""&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Community Approach to Dog Bite Prevention&lt;/em&gt;, JAVMA 2001 June; 218(11): 1732-1749&lt;/a&gt;). However just like those who advocate that attacks are instigated by formerly abused dogs, my theory is not supported by any study that has tracked both breed and other potential contributing factors such as reproductive status, sex, age, socialization, etc. I hope to see such a study conducted in the near future so that we can put this issue to bed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr Various studies seem to indicate that breed isn&amp;#39;t the dominant factor driving dog attacks. An alternate theory is that reproductive status is key (possibly other factors) but no studies have been performed to verify.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying that is not very different than saying that black people are inherently to commit crimes. Black people are the majority in prison on USA because they are black, or because they are born in a bad community who doesn&amp;#39;t allow them to be a productive individual?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pitbulls are indeed the breed that are most involved with violence. But because they are violent or because there is a culture of people that raise pitbulls to be violent?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, unlike my example with black people, some breeds may be more aggressive than the others. But this don&amp;#39;t make then inherently dangerous. Keep in mind that &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_bull#Studies""&gt;a study determined that &amp;quot;high risk&amp;quot; dog owners had nearly 10 times as many criminal convictions then did &amp;quot;low risk&amp;quot; dog owners.&lt;/a&gt; So there is a correlation with how these dogs were raised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: The Holocaust is not a unique genocide (when compared to other genocides).,"I recently was watching this past Sunday's episode of ""The Big Questions."" The episode asked whether it ""is the time coming to lay the Holocaust to rest."" I think there was an interesting discussion over whether the Holocaust is a unique genocide in comparison with some of the other major genocides in the century.   I tend to agree that the Holocaust, as awful as it was, was no more unique or terrible than the genocides that occurred in Rwanda, Darfur, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Bosnia, etc. In each of these genocides, hundreds of thousands to millions of people died, based on nothing more than their religion or ethnicity. It seemed from the discussion and other arguments I've had with friends, the Holocaust may have been unique because it came from a ""civilized"" or ""intelligent"" religion. I think that argument is entirely too weak because it implies that Germany was more civilized than all of these other nations that committed these harsh genocides. Considering the number of genocides committed by more powerful nations who claim to be ""civilized"", I think such a claim is invalid.  I am quite sure my view is quite outside the mainstream, and want to see whether I am missing something here. CMV  tl;dr The Holocaust was an awful crime, but it is not uniquely worse than other genocides.  EDIT: After seeing some of the comments, I see why Europeans should view the Holocaust in a different way, but I have yet to see why the Holocaust should be globally viewed in a different manner. Why should people in Bangladesh, Indonesia, or Sudan care that much about the Holocaust when a similarly awful tragedy occurred on their own soil?  EDIT2: Many people mention the horrible industrialized systematic nature of the Holocaust as a differentiating factor. I agree that it is frightening how systematic it was, but I think it is important to compare the Holocaust with the Bangladeshi and Rwandan genocides, both of which had similar systematic tendencies. How is the Holocaust unique compared to those two genocides to a random person in Africa or Asia?  EDIT3: I think I understand why the Holocaust operates in this unique space. It is not that the crimes that occurred in the Holocaust were worse, it's that the impact of it is greater. It caused human rights concerns to actually come out. This is because it was a genocide that finally affected the base of power in the world, the Europeans. Thanks for contributing everyone! 'Twas fun. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There was no plan to exterminate the Jews and no evidence to support that except testimonials. Most of the WW2 Holocaust propaganda pictures came after the war after the Allies decimated Europe and left people in the camps to die of famine and typhus. But there was a plan to deport the Jews otherwise they wouldn&amp;#39;t spend massive amounts of resources and manpower to keep transporting them from place to place when they have already isolated them in the ghettos. They would have killed them in the ghettos like in Schindler s List and not keep them alive for the 5 year duration of the entire war. It is not denying the Holocaust because it did happen, but there was no evidence for mass killings. Holocaust denial was a term coined by Israel and Poland the same way conspiracy theory was coined by the CIA during the JFK assassination.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now may I ask you 2 questions. How many Jews do you think died. And where do you think are all the concentration camps located? Don&amp;#39;t even google it just give me your info from the top of your head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Holocaust has some more or less unique characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First of all, the size was in some ways unprecedented. Six million Jews and five million others died. There are other mass killings that are similar in magnitude, but I&amp;#39;d argue that the selectivity and specificity of it adds another dimension. In other places, you&amp;#39;d see people die from a certain amount of ethnic cleansing in addition to lots of deaths from famine and disease. In the holocaust, people weren&amp;#39;t gunned down in the streets but rather selected individually to die, and they almost managed to eradicate Jews in Europe completely.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Secondly, the industrialised manner it was done in was new. One million died in just one single camp at Birkenau. And it wasn&amp;#39;t just that there were concentration camps, they went through painstaking effort to find the absolute most efficient way to rid the Earth of &lt;em&gt;untermensch&lt;/em&gt;. Six million wouldn&amp;#39;t have been anywhere close to the final number if the Reich was able to continue unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thirdly, it happened &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, or at least somewhere your corner of the world likely has deep ties to, if you&amp;#39;re reading this site in the first place. It was done in an industrialised and otherwise modern nation, and it was well recorded, unlike for instance the war crimes of Japan during the same time period. We know all too well what happened and how.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: It is morally and practically unjustifiable to join the Stormcloaks. (Spoilers),"I am a huge fan of Skyrim's civil war storyline because both sides are somewhat morally ambiguous, leaving it to each player to determine which side is worth joining. I wish to argue that when one looks at the situation as a whole, the Imperial Legion is objectively the lighter shade of grey.  Admittedly, I have had a pro-Imperial bias since before I first started playing Skyrim. Based on my experiences in both Morrowind (especially so) and Oblivion, the Cyrodiilic Empire has always seemed like a very nice place to be, and so I've always been an Imperial loyalist. I was surprised that joining the rebels was even an option.  But now, after having analyzed the backgrounds and motivations of both sides, I'm even more of an Imperial loyalist than ever. This is because of the following reasons.  **1. A united Empire would be a stronger bulwark against Dominion aggression. Also, the Empire is generally good for Skyrim.**  This should be fairly obvious. If Skyrim was to secede from the Empire, then High Rock would be cut off from Cyrodiil, and could very well secede in turn. Hammerfell was already kicked out of the Empire, and whatever is left of Morrowind that has not been destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vvardenfell lies under the de facto control of the Kingdom of Argonia. (**EDIT** Argonia was actually kicked out of Morrowind due to the efforts of House Redoran.) In the event of a successful Stormcloak rebellion, the Dominion would be able to destroy the nations of men piecemeal.  Of course, a quick and decisive victory for the rebels is not quite optimal for the Thalmor; they would prefer that both sides bleed one another out (and don't forget that Ulfric is a Thalmor asset of a sort). But if they cannot have that, I'm sure that they would prefer to take on a bunch of smaller human kingdoms than one larger human Empire. Of course, for any of those who actually like the Dominion, this is a wonderful reason to join the Stormcloaks.  There is also the matter of trade and mutual benefit. Jarl Balgruuf says as much. Skyrim gets to benefit from the rich lands to the south, and in exchange Cyrodiil gets the protection of some of the best warriors on Tamriel.  **2. Ulfric's killing of King Toryyg sets a dangerous precedent.**  As Uncle Alvor put it:  &gt;Once the jarls start killing each other, we're back to the bad old days.  Ulfric's claim on rulership of Skyrim boils down to ""might begets right"". ""Well no kidding, that's how rebellions work,"" some of you might be saying. But Ulfric's point in killing the king was that leadership comes from individual martial prowess. No king who cannot beat challengers in single combat is fit to rule. Such an attitude does not belong in any civilized society, because it is hazardous to stability. What's to stop Skyrim from falling into civil war again in a generation if someone decides that he doesn't like Ulfric's successor?  It would have been different if Ulfric had asked Toryyg to declare independence from the Empire. Toryyg would have seriously considered it, and if he had agreed, then this point would be moot. As events turned out the way that they did, I'm convinced that Ulfric's rebellion is at least partially motivated by his own personal ambition: he still would not have wanted to be a vassal to Toryyg.  There are other points to be made about the Great War, the White-Gold Concordat, the release of Hammerfell, and the Markarth Incident, but I'll address those if they come up. So, rebel scum^^^I'm ^^^sorry , CMV if you can.  **EDIT**  First Delta goes to /u/Rdmknowledge. I've enjoyed having this discussion with all of you about one of my most beloved games. But I'm tired now, and I'll be back tomorrow. Feel free to continue this discussion.  ^^^Talos ^^^guide ^^^you ^^^all.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;A united Empire would be a stronger bulwark against Dominion aggression. Also, the Empire is generally good for Skyrim.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But clearly the Empire is not united as it appeared to be.  If it were this dissent for it wouldn&amp;#39;t have started in the first place.   There is only one party to blame when it comes to this scenario and that is leadership. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This should be fairly obvious. If Skyrim was to secede from the Empire, then High Rock would be cut off from Cyrodiil, and could very well secede in turn. Hammerfell was already kicked out of the Empire, and whatever is left of Morrowind that has not been destroyed by the eruption of Mt.

In the event of a successful Stormcloak rebellion, the Dominion would be able to destroy the nations of men piecemeal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But at-least this would actually involve fighting instead of having a puppet government.  Wouldn&amp;#39;t you rather go down fighting than submit to this?  Just try to imagine this in a real world terms imagine the government of the nation you are in is overthrown by a foreign power and has occupational forces (which you see all over Skyrim) in your lands  with your new government giving into any and all demands.  Would you really side with that?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, a quick and decisive victory for the rebels is not quite optimal for the Thalmor; they would prefer that both sides bleed one another out (and don&amp;#39;t forget that Ulfric is a Thalmor asset of a sort). But if they cannot have that, I&amp;#39;m sure that they would prefer to take on a bunch of smaller human kingdoms than one larger human Empire. Of course, for any of those who actually like the Dominion, this is a wonderful reason to join the Stormcloaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With the puppet government installed and under their thumb the rebellion only stands to hurt them in the end.  If they wanted to murder all humans they would have simply continued their crusade as they were clearly winning to begin with.   Instead the human races are being beaten into submission and it&amp;#39;s sicking that other humans are taking part in it.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is also the matter of trade and mutual benefit. Jarl Balgruuf says as much. Skyrim gets to benefit from the rich lands to the south, and in exchange Cyrodiil gets the protection of some of the best warriors on Tamriel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The average citizen in Skyrim is not very wealthy and do not have much to show for  so this only benefits those already wealthy which is a minority of the population.   Even if you were one of those wealthy people would you feel right selling out everyone&amp;#39;s freedom to continue access to luxury goods?   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ulfric&amp;#39;s claim on rulership of Skyrim boils down to &amp;quot;might begets right&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Well no kidding, that&amp;#39;s how rebellions work,&amp;quot; some of you might be saying.

What&amp;#39;s to stop Skyrim from falling into civil war again in a generation if someone decides that he doesn&amp;#39;t like Ulfric&amp;#39;s successor?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Can you give any realistic alternative Ulfric had?   Even if Ulfric had somehow peacefully managed to convince several Jarls to switch to his side without him raising a sword for his own cause this would have still lead to the same bloodshed.   Would you follow a man that isn&amp;#39;t willing to fight for what he believes in while sending you out to do tasks? Ulfric&amp;#39;s successor could be voted on democratically by the other Jarls which is the proper tradition.   We are also assuming that Ulfric wouldn&amp;#39;t be willing to put that vote up after the civil war if that was asked of him obviously he would win the vote and this would only further secure his right to the claim.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would have been different if Ulfric had asked Toryyg to declare independence from the Empire. Toryyg would have seriously considered it, and if he had agreed, then this point would be moot. As events turned out the way that they did, I&amp;#39;m convinced that Ulfric&amp;#39;s rebellion is at least partially motivated by his own personal ambition: he still would not have wanted to be a vassal to Toryyg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Toryyg was a puppet that was pro-empire  and not even properly elected.    The Empire also lies on the account of what happened in this scenario.  They accused Ulfric of l doing a shout that literally ripped Toryyg apart.  However we know that Ulfric lacks that amount of power to do the shouts  and Ulfric himself is both honest and humble on the subject saying he did it as  a method of knocking Toryyg  down to deliver the final blow.   Since Ulfric told the truth about that account it makes much more sense that Toryyg accepted this duel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, I am not going to say that the Stormcloaks are perfect because they aren&amp;#39;t  they make bad choices too and are often emotional rather than rational.  Race is a big subject in such.   But those issues can be dealt with in time where as the Empire is under a boot and doesn&amp;#39;t have the freedom to change.  The Stormcloaks at-least have hope.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last point I will make before awaiting your response is if we are assuming the Dovahkiin is siding with the Stormcloaks  they have the most powerful being on the planet on their side.  No one living person in Tamriel and perhaps all of Nirn can honestly boast of greater exploits.   He/she has the ability to clearly influence the war not just on the battlefield itself but because they are a hero who saved the world and that is something they can get behind.    The rebellion wouldn&amp;#39;t stop at Skyrim it would reach all over and the Empire the true Empire not the boot lickers we have now would rise like a phoenix out of the ashes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If we were to instead view the Dovahkiin as pro-Empire the Empire has no desire for another great war and grown content in being a puppet and keeping all their pitiful titles and riches.   The  Dovahkiin  is a oppressor in this scenario.   I would also like to note where did  Titus II  flee to when Cyrodiil fell?  Skyrim,   where did he get his reinforcements that captured it back?  Skyrim.    The Aldmeri Dominion fear Skyrim, as they do Hammerfell which they failed to conquer.  Titus cowardly surrendered in a war he would have won.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, I&amp;#39;m a pretty hardcore Stormcloak guy, so let&amp;#39;s get this going. First things first, we both recognize that the goal of both Imperial and Stormcloak is to destroy or at least heavily damage the Aldmeri Dominion to the point where they can&amp;#39;t be aggressive, so I won&amp;#39;t waste time establishing that. And we both consider the political and final outcome in that regard to be more important than freedom of religion in skyrim, that the rebellion should be practical rather than principled.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1 The Empire has demonstrated within recent history that they are willing to cede territory to the Thalmor. Look at what happened at Hammerfell because of the White-gold Concordat. With this in mind, there&amp;#39;s no reason to suppose that the Nords would feel safer under the rule of the empire.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And about Hammerfell, they successfully proved that the Altmer can be bled so much during an invasion that they will give up. If Skyrim were to successfully cecede, there&amp;#39;s little reason to think that these nations wouldn&amp;#39;t provide aid to one another. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, the Aldmeri Dominion may have more might than either Hammerfell or Skyrim, possibly even both, but the successes it experiences are likely to be too costly to be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the positive military argument for secession, now let&amp;#39;s look at the negative one. The Altmer live for a very long time, and reproduce very slowly, the common thought is that the empire will end the cease-fire in another human generation or so, and destroy the weakened elven army, but this is a very narrow point of view that misses several factors in my opinion. This assumes that Thalmor propaganda fails to make the new generation peaceable. It assumes that the Khajiit, who are very allied with the Thalmor and very capable warriors, will not join the fight. And lastly, it assumes that the Thalmor are so stupid that they didn&amp;#39;t realize this, and just chose to end the war short of annihilating the empire because they thought true peace was possible. This is ridiculous. They have a plan, and based on the obvious lack of insight that the empire has as to what this plan is and how to counteract it, continuing under their guidance is very foolish.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2 Ulfric killing Torygg is definitely a bad thing, no argument here, but is it worse than what the Empire is selling? The empires very existence is a display of Might makes Right. Skyrim became a part of the empire with the beginnings of the Septim Dynasty, to follow a Dragonborn. Once Martin dies, so to do the terms of their agreement. The Empire&amp;#39;s entire claim to Skyrim is &amp;quot;We can make you.&amp;quot; Skyrim went along with this because the costs of secession outweighed the benefits, when the appraisal is made that this is no longer the case, the Empire loses its legal leverage and now only has an army for its claim. Now, as for the killing itself, I find it very important to consider one aspect, which is that it was a challenge.  The in game text seems to support the idea that Torygg could have denied the challenge and lost honor, but not the throne. This idea is floated again by Proventus Avenicii (Thalmor party lover) when talking to Jarl Balgruuf. With a common enemy, I see little reason for the Jarls to engage in in-fighting after driving out the Imperials.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3 Now for some original points you may not have considered. First and foremost, the PC is the goddamn Last DragonBorn. The LDB has IMMENSE power. They couldn&amp;#39;t conquer the Summerset Isles on their own, but with an army at their back, it wouldn&amp;#39;t even be a challenge. The Stormcloack army (with possible Redguard support) could tear the heart of the Aldmeri Dominion out very quickly if led by the LDB. The Empire is unlikely to give the kind of military support necessary though, preferring instead their own might, and likely viewing the LDB as a political threat. Don&amp;#39;t forget that the Empire was initially formed by such a being.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This other point ties back in to the first one, but is a little out there. What is the goal of the Thalmor? The short answer, to unmake creation. Talos worship isn&amp;#39;t about worshiping a man who became a god, it&amp;#39;s about the mythopoeic power that this worship has, and its role in holding the stability of creation. Think about the Thalmor &amp;quot;advisor&amp;quot; in the College of Winterhold, he wasn&amp;#39;t acting alone out of insanity. The Thalmor view is that creation is a mistake, and they want to go back to being Anuic souls. This ceasefire with the empire gives them enough lee-way and free passage to go around investing and destroying the towers, and that absolutely can&amp;#39;t be allowed to continue for the decades required for the empire to build up its forces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
Conceiving a child is always unethical because positive and negative morality are asymmetric. CMV.,"I believe it is unethical for anyone to choose to bring a child into existence. Not just people who are unfit to be parents, not just because there are already children who need to be adopted, not even because of overpopulation-- rather, choosing to conceive is **always** morally wrong.   My reasoning goes: A non-zero number of people will experience more pain than happiness in their lives, and some of these people will prefer not have been born. Bringing those people into existence condemns them to suffering, which is morally wrong.   I do not believe you are doing any harm to a person by never causing them to exist. However, you *are* doing harm to someone by causing them to experience suffering. David Benatar calls this the asymmetry thesis: The presence of pain is bad; the absence of pain is good. The presence of pleasure is good; but the absence of pleasure is not bad. (A good summary of Benatar is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism#Moral_responsibility). Following this, even if there were a 99.9% chance your child would be happy and a 0.1% chance it would be sad, it is still wrong to take the risk. Having a happy child is not a moral imperative, but not having an unhappy child *is* a moral imperative. In other words, bringing someone who enjoys life into existence may be supererogatory, but ***not* bringing someone who would rather not be alive into existence is obligatory**.  ...  I anticipate these counterarguments:  1. The majority of people are glad to be alive, making the morality of conception a net positive.  2. Doing good and preventing bad should be considered symmetric; you do equal harm by not providing a potential person a good life as you do by causing a person to live a bad life.  Here are my responses:  1. I don't know how many people prefer existence over nonexistence or vice-versa. **But even if the number favoring existence far outweigh the number favoring nonexistence, this does not justify conception**. Compare it to this (admittedly imperfect) analogy: If you could press a button that had a 99.9% chance of causing your friend to be happy until his/her death, and a 0.1% chance of making him/her suffer until death, would probably still think it was wrong to push the button, at least without the consent of the friend. The child you conceive does not consent to suffering or the possibility of suffering, so I view conception to be an equally unethical gamble. **No matter the likelihood of a positive outcome for the child, the possibility of any negative outcomes makes conception morally wrong.**   2. The difference is whom the harm is being done to. By not creating a good life, you only harm somebody who doesn't exist. So, this can't really be considered significant harm. By creating a bad life, you harm someone who does exist. So, this harm can be considered significant. (This is essentially the variabilist solution. More here: http://people.su.se/~guarr/FGkurs/RobertsAsymmetry2011.pdf)   *TL,DR removed because it seemed to be misleading some people.* ---   *In his papers, Benatar also argues that non-existence is always preferable to existence-- this is not my view.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This view unrealistically simplifies the complexities of life. Why is &amp;#39;happiness&amp;#39; the ultimate goal anyway? What if someone is unhappy for 51% of their life, but even when they aren&amp;#39;t happy they are doing rad shit and they are REALLY happy 49% of the time? What does &amp;#39;happiness&amp;#39; even mean in this context? and how can it be quantified? I think any way of trying to actually make that happiness calculation are so flawed as to be useless when making any decision.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What about a person who is unhappy quite a lot, but they use that experience to write a book that makes 10,000 people much much happier than they would have been otherwise? Does that net happiness cancel out the misery of the author?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What if in the future there is a pill everyone can take to be totally happy and satisfied? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What if a person is mostly unhappy but wants to keep living for those rare experiences of &amp;quot;happiness&amp;quot;. That person surely isn&amp;#39;t better off dead. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How many people only suffer in their lives? I think almost none. most people experience a range that defies this absolute and unrealistic &amp;quot;suffering or happines&amp;quot; scale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, people don&amp;#39;t just want to kill themselves one day and then it stays that way for the rest of their life. That&amp;#39;s what choosing anti-natalism is like too- one day you might think it&amp;#39;s the right idea but tomorrow you might think that actually existence is great. Plenty of people try suicide, fail, and then live out the rest of their lives glad it went that way. Everyone in the world simultaneously deciding that it&amp;#39;s better to just go extinct is not really going to happen, and even if it did, the next day a bunch of people would change their minds. You have to exist in the first place to even make the decision to go extinct, either personally or as a species and that flaws the whole idea. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How do you know if your whole life is suffering until you get to the end of your natural life? Once you can make a judgement it&amp;#39;s all over, and by that point you already have had kids or hadn&amp;#39;t without knowing if it was going to be the right decision. This whole system seems entirely bunk to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of your points are based off of the risk factor. There is the risk that your offspring will suffer, therefor you should not have offspring. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;#39;s utterly ridiculous. No parent will ever know what the life of their child will be like. So because a small percentage of people born will experience suffering, you argue we should just stop reproducing all together. But then you taking away the potential non-suffering state of the rest of all the other lives. John and Mary are deciding if they should have kids. They decide not to on the grounds that their child &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; suffer. They feel the risk is too great to take the chance. They are then robbing the potential person of the potential joys of live. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So I would assume you would also disagree with the old mantra that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. If one person should die in order to save the lives of one hundred people, you believe that that person should not die, because his &amp;quot;suffering&amp;quot; in the sense of removing the rest of his life and the potentials joys he experiences outweighs the lives of the other hundred people? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;#39;t think (correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong) that you&amp;#39;ve addressed that the biological &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; of all life is to procreate. From a purely biological standpoint, we are baby making machines. That is what we are for. That is what our genes perpetuate. That is our &amp;quot;purpose&amp;quot;, if you will. How would that factor into your argument? Okay, so potential suffering is bad, so we should eliminate any chance that suffering may occur, but is that worth completely disregarding our 3.5 billion year instincts of survival? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"CMV: Religion created a fear of death, and it's time to get rid of both.","Religion has been a huge problem ever since its first inception, and has used its will over vulnerable people to make them fear death. We no longer have a need for religion or a need to fear death as we can now answer many of the questions that people fled to religion to find.   **1) Religion was created to answer questions of the unknown, we now have other resources that can answer these questions for us.**  * Science and technology have not only disproved religion but have made it almost obsolete. We now understand human biology, space &amp; time (for the most part), human psychology, chemistry, plant life, animal life, water, air, drugs, sociology, there is a lot more that we know now that were unthinkable in the days of religion. We no longer need religious texts to help us understand life.    **2) Religious books are outdated.**  * They're old, and they preach teachings of a much more ignorant and fearful time. (If you need further explanation here then refer yourself to the Bible, Koran, Torah, you get it. Or just do a basic google search, ""bigotry in the _____"")    **3) Religion has taught us to fear more than it has to love and has created utter hysteria on the topic of life and death.**  * Religion teaches that when you die you have two options in the afterlife, eternal happiness in paradise, or eternal damnation. This has caused people to worry over what will happen to them when they die and makes them act differently while alive as they only live to set their place in the afterlife.  * Because of religion people have been taught to fear death. Death is an inevitable event beyond our current comprehension that has existed since the beginning of time. It is not only pointless to fear death, but absurd.  * Death is something in life that is uncontrollable and simply just happens. We don't have to understand death or what happens after death, we just have to understand it and accept it.  * Death happens everyday, that's how life works, trying to come up with an answer to ""comfort"" yourself with is illogical and irrational. Accept that it happens, just like birth, and move on so that the fear of death is not lingering over you for the rest of your life.    **4) Religion separates humanity.**  * When a certain train of thought is drilled into someone mind, it is hard for them to change their views and no longer accept what they thought was true for so long. This has caused a separation of logical, progressive and political thought as people are on opposite sides of the spectrum on many social matters due to the teachings of their religion and has held back humanity atrociously.  * The separation that religion has caused can also be tied in with the problem of nationalism, but instead of people from different countries hating each other, you have people in the same countries who start violent feuds with each other due to different beliefs, even though all of their beliefs preach ""non-violence"" and ""respect"".     **5) Finally, people who cling to religion lack proper intellect and reasoning.**  * People so foolishly cling to religion as a form of comfort because they are too ignorant to open themselves to a different train of thought. It scares them to think that what they have relied on for so long is false and believe that a world without religion would be utter chaos.  * People who rely on religion need to wake up and escape the ignorant mindset that has been almost engraved into them.   * We need to stop preaching and supporting religion in our society as it is detrimental to the growth of human intellect, and is nothing but a flawed and hypocritical system that is run on fear, subjugation and false attainment/happiness.  Edit: To be more clear, this pertains to Christianity, Judaism and Islam, and any of their denominations. I do not hold the same argument in terms of Eastern religions as that is a separate argument. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Basic survival instinct created a fear of death. It is an innate part of our biological/psychological make-up. That alone nullifies your entire post. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) Religion has not been disproved by Science. Some aspects of some religions may have by not the whole of them all. And most of the questions that religion addresses cannot be answered by the sciences. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) To some extent. They also teach principles that transcend time. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3 &amp;amp; 4) Religions primary purposes are to give comfort and explanation for things that our logic and observation cannot explain, to teach and reinforce a societies morals and ethics (something vital for survival as a group), and to provide of point of fellowship that fosters community and oneness within a region or group of people. Yes these thing can be points of contention between groups, but without some unifying feature such as religion we would fraction into more sub groups, not unify into one global whole. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;6) This is a blatant lie and insult. Many of our top scientists were religious. To quote Einstein: &amp;quot;Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Pure presumption on your part.  You &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; religion was created in this way for this reason, a believer would disagree.  This entire point rests on your presumption that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; religion is false; or that it is at best a lie that serves a practical function.  You seem to discount any possibility that it might be true.  If you&amp;#39;re unwilling to question that presumption, this CMV will be fruitless.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Science and technology have not only disproved religion but have made it almost obsolete.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How do you suppose that religion has been disproven?  Various religious claims may have been found to lack support sufficient to prove them true, but I think you&amp;#39;ll find that the difference between a believer and a non-believer often boils down to what a person believes is sufficient evidence to prove something.  Oddly enough, there is no evidence that indicates how much evidence we ought to need to believe something.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit - This is in large part because many of the most important religious claims are &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability""&gt;non-falsifiable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) Time does not make the truth false.  Again, this rests on your unsupported presumptions of falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By what reasoning do you determine that these texts contain bigotry and by what system of values do you determine that bigotry is bad?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) This is a very simplistic generalization of religious beliefs; so much so that it&amp;#39;s difficult to correct.  Once again, you&amp;#39;re basing this on the presumption that it&amp;#39;s all false.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Religion teaches that when you die you have two options in the afterlife, eternal happiness in paradise, or eternal damnation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some religious believers think that, others do not.  Even if you&amp;#39;re not going to question your major presumption, you do need to recognize that treating religion as a homogeneous, singular entity is incorrect.  Beliefs vary widely and it&amp;#39;s disingenuous to engage only with the other side&amp;#39;s worst possible argument.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This has caused people to worry over what will happen to them when they die and makes them act differently while alive as they only live to set their place in the afterlife.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And this is necessarily a bad thing?  If this impulse kept them from hurting people or made them honest when they could have lied, wouldn&amp;#39;t it be positive?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of religion people have been taught to fear death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People begin fearing death as soon as they realize it can happen to them.  Religion didn&amp;#39;t cause that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You disregard any questions of existence after death as if you have some definitive evidence that it cannot happen.  In the absence of that evidence, this idea you have that the only rational response is to accept death and think no more is both irrational and arrogant.   You have no reason to make the claim, much less make it as confidently as you do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4) People are separated by disagreements of all kinds and getting rid of them without resolving them only works if you&amp;#39;re going to disregard anything the other side says.  You may be content with your assumptions about the nature of death and you may not need solid reasoning to back the values underpinning your morals and ethics, but others disagree.  For you to assume that the disagreement should be resolved because you feel like it should be resolved is irrational.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Make arguments and convince people that you&amp;#39;re correct, don&amp;#39;t just claim that the argument should be over because you want it to be so.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;5) I can&amp;#39;t tell if this is a strawman or just an insult to the religious.  You&amp;#39;re not just presuming that all religion is wrong, you&amp;#39;re presuming that no religious person actually believes what they claim they do and that they are willfully deluding themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So in other words: you feel that the falsehood of religion is a foregone conclusion despite the billions who disagree with you.  You believe this so thoroughly that you assume everyone else really knows it too, therefore everyone who says otherwise is either deluded, a liar or both.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So long as you keep this view, you&amp;#39;re precluding any rational engagement with a person of faith.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0

I'm particularly referring to cars I see regularly, at work for instance--if you drive a vehicle every single day that requires no insignificant amount of physical capability to crawl in and out of, you posess the physical capability to walk from the parking lot at large with the rest of us. This leaves those spaces open for those who really need them.   This isn't a rant, I'm truly open to having my mind changed here. I'm hoping there's something I'm missing!

CMV: Analog clocks are pointless.,"Analog clocks are a throwback to a time when we needed mechanics and gears to create clocks. They are unintuitive, and we are wasting time teaching first graders how to tell time on analog clocks when a superior alternative exists.  Digital clocks are intuitive, easier and faster to read, more reliable, and more accurate. The only acceptable place for an analog clock is on a watch because watches are jewelry first and time-telling devices second.   Technology has improved, and analog clocks are obsolete.  People don't use oil lanterns to light their homes, and they don't use horse-drawn carriages to get to work. So why are analog clocks still used so often?

Men's rights advocacy on reddit has lost sight of reality. CMV.,"http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1khs6k/guy_getting_attacked_by_girl_punches_back/[1]  The only reason this video is on the front page is because men feel truly oppressed by what they perceive to be a double standard that says they can't hit women even if they're being attacked. If you doubt that this video is purely about gender roles, ask yourself if it would be on the front page if all the parties involved were male.  By feeling oppressed by this dynamic, I think most men are fundamentally failing to understand~~ a) how much more common it is for men to be violent towards women,~~ b) the culture of fear and intimidation that such violence breeds, and c) how ridiculous it makes you look to cheer and go ""Right on!"" in the relatively rare case where a man is justified in hitting a woman.  Anyone remember the last time a story about a woman defending herself against a violent man was on the front page? Me neither.  EDIT: A few people have accurately pointed out that the frequency of cases of women perpetrating violence against men is roughly the same as men perpetrating violence against women. Others have also pointed out that what makes violence against women more pernicious is the greater damage that men are able to inflict. In making the initial point, I was attempting to demonstrate that violence is a way of asserting power or control, and in the case of men committing violence against women, that power dynamic is shifted heavily in their favor. The overall point about men equating violence against women with violence against men stands -- it is not a valid comparison, and most of the men making it seem to be fundamentally failing to understand how those power dynamics make the two situations quite different.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only reason this video is on the front page is because men feel truly oppressed by what they perceive to be a double standard that says they can&amp;#39;t hit women even if they&amp;#39;re being attacked.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I may be wrong but I&amp;#39;m fairly sure this has been fairly well documented as a double standard, men are usually assumed to be the aggressors in most situations based on the harmful female stereotype that all women are fragile and powerless and the harmful male stereotype that all men are violent. I know I would be weary to hit a woman who hit me since I would perceive it as wrong, even though logically that makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you doubt that this video is purely about gender roles, ask yourself if it would be on the front page if all the parties involved were male.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This might not be about gender roles and just about justice porn (we even have a subreddit for it) which reddit loves like &lt;a href=""/u/BenIncognito""&gt;/u/BenIncognito&lt;/a&gt; points out, but you don&amp;#39;t even have to agree with that. People wanting to see rules of gender roles being broken in justified situations doesn&amp;#39;t seem like something that has lost sight of reality.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;By feeling oppressed by this dynamic, I think most men are fundamentally failing to understand a) how much more common it is for men to be violent towards women&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think so, right? The idea that there is a great deal of violence done to women is not mutually exclusive with the idea that when violence is done to men by women there is societal pressure to endure the abuse rather than to defend oneself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;b) the culture of fear and intimidation that such violence breeds&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It would have been much cooler if the guy had somehow flipped the tables through a peaceful method, but I don&amp;#39;t think the video supported violence as much as it supported self defense. The victim seems to try to ignore the violent assailant, and to resist the attacks but as the assailant continues to attack the victim, said victim choose to defend himself. It is an answer of violence with violence, but the video itself doesn&amp;#39;t seem to promote violence. Now we may simply not have the full context of the situation and our assessment may be wrong but that would have more to do with lack of doing research on the video than our views of the video itself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;c) how ridiculous it makes you look to cheer and go &amp;quot;Right on!&amp;quot; in the relatively rare case where a man is justified in hitting a woman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I agree it&amp;#39;s a bit silly when we cheer people on for violence, even if it is self defense, for giving us that cathartic self righteous feeling but that doesn&amp;#39;t seem to have anything to do with gender roles. It seems to me however that you think this is ridiculous because you may still be attached to the perception that for some reason women are weaker or more fragile than men, which is a sexist assumption to make. Don&amp;#39;t worry, I do it myself, but just like every other gender stereotype we would probably benefit from moving on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyone remember the last time a story about a woman defending herself against a violent man was on the front page? Me neither.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That is true, and it is sad. However the reality is since the majority of the reddit population is male this is a more cathartic experience to them given they have experience this double standard in real life, so that although entertaining the same situation with the genders reversed would not give everyone the same tingly feeling. This isn&amp;#39;t a good thing by any means, but I don&amp;#39;t know if we could argue it indicates a loss of understanding of what reality is.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lastly you seem to generalize that all of men&amp;#39;s rights advocacy must have lost sight of reality, and that doesn&amp;#39;t seem justified. I sadly tend to assume most masculinists or MRAs are mysoginists based on my own personal experience, and thankfully this seems less true everyday, but even I would not be so quick to generalize. So I went to &lt;a href=""/r/masculinism""&gt;/r/masculinism&lt;/a&gt; and clicked on the first post I saw on the front page, and I will link it to you &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/masculism/comments/1j9vy4/objectification_and_the_male_power_fantasy/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where there was a fairly interesting analysis on the use of male characters as both objects and subjects. Which quite honestly I was impressed by, and seems fairly grounded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where MRA comes from: Take men who are not comfortable with some of their gender roles. They turn to feminism as a model to rebel against these gender roles. Many feminists believe that these men do not have the right to complain as they have privilege in society. So, these men go off on their own and often outright reject feminism as many feminists have rejected them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Others have also pointed out that what makes violence against women more pernicious is the greater damage that men are able to inflict. In making the initial point, I was attempting to demonstrate that violence is a way of asserting power or control, and in the case of men committing violence against women, that power dynamic is shifted heavily in their favor. The overall point about men equating violence against women with violence against men stands -- it is not a valid comparison, and most of the men making it seem to be fundamentally failing to understand how those power dynamics make the two situations quite different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other words, unlike abuse against women, abuse against men can be ignored, because men have more muscle mass. In other words, when men want to make a point about abuse against men, you are more or less saying that that point is less valid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The whole thing about physical power differential is frankly insulting to anyone who&amp;#39;s been in an abusive relationship. After I called the cops on my abusive ex (a twink that is 6&amp;quot; shorter and 100 pounds lighter), I had to stay at a friend&amp;#39;s place as I did not feel safe in my home. He would keep calling me to harass me about how he would call the cops on me and they would believe him because he&amp;#39;s so much smaller. He would tell everyone that I raped and attacked him and I lost friends, because they believed him because he&amp;#39;s small and effeminate. I ended up using the local domestic violence hotline, because people banging on my upstairs neighbors door made me curl up into a fetal position, because I thought he was back to hurt me. But, of course, as he is much smaller than me, according to you my concerns aren&amp;#39;t as justified. (btw, before you make a claim about us being men, a similar situation happened to a lesbian friend of mine. Borderline is hell to be with.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The biggest issue with abuse is the psychological side effects. Bruises heal faster than one&amp;#39;s sense of safety. Women can be just as psychologically damaging as men and to mitigate the mens&amp;#39; feelings as many feminists do is just making the problem worse. The worse part, honestly, is feeling like nobody believes that you were abused.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, what about MRAs? Look, I&amp;#39;m no MRA as most of the issues they focus on don&amp;#39;t pertain to me. However, this comes back to them being normal people. People just try to do the best they can with the resources they have. Men and women &lt;strong&gt;both&lt;/strong&gt; are forced into gender roles. Many men don&amp;#39;t like some of these roles. Many feminists mitigate their issues. So, what are they to do? They are not allowed to use the solid theoretical framework underlying feminism, so they don&amp;#39;t have the intellectual framework needed to coherently make their argument. So, they go &amp;quot;Right On!&amp;quot; when a woman is justifiably hit (although, I disagree that this is a ridiculous thing to do). They don&amp;#39;t have the framework to coherently comprehend their frustrations nor a forum that will take them seriously (since they aren&amp;#39;t taken seriously by many feminists), so they share stories of when a man justifiably hits a woman as the only way they know how to express their issues.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Women justifiably hitting men doesn&amp;#39;t make the front page, because women don&amp;#39;t need that justification and everyone already agrees that hitting women (abuse or not) is a bad thing to do. Women hitting men is nothing new or shocking. However, men justifiably hitting women is often frowned upon (no matter how just it is), so MRAs post these videos and upvote them as their way to argue that men can justifiably defend themselves against women. They have a serious concern (abuse by women on men) and express this concern the only way they know how (articles about men defending themselves and cheering when men do).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"I think Weed is toxic to your psyche and it should be kept illegal , CMV","I'm not an angry mother,i'm actually 17 years old currently finishing school. I'm not very wealthy nor poor. Weed has spread in my city since I moved here 7 years ago. A few years ago the people around me and almost the whole part of the school started smoking on weekends,some during the week, some smoke before school has even started. I smoked on the weekends as well for quite some time until my brother talked to me (after busting me) and that was the first time i realized how much you fuck your life up smoking weed. People stop doing hobbies,they stop going to school regularly,they become shadows of what they used to be. Those are no exceptions which im talking about im talking about regular people (most of them 18+) ,who used to have a busy life until they just stopped doing anything. They seem to become dumber,they care less about everything and spend their whole time on weed. Of course,**there are people who can control their consumption** ,but that's the minority. It's something you don't notice,you smoke on the weekend,just in the evening,then behind the mall and then you buy your first weed on your own. And that is the crucial point **why i think weed should be illegal and it's just right that alcohol is allowed**. Becoming an alcoholic is a complete different process,which is more obvious and you can control the consumption,there are obvious side effects. You don't notice you're addicted to weed since the addicts don't care unless it's way,way too late. They just accept it and laugh about how stoned they are everywhere. They use boredom or other things as an excuse and miss most of their life. Legalization would just support the idea that it doesn't do any harm and getting high everyday is ok.   **It is not,when you need something to make your life okay,change your life,not the drug.**   * to clarify : I think somebody is addicted to weed when he stops doing the things he loved to do,he neglects his surronding friends and family and smokes every day,all the time.  **Note** I don't want to hate on weed and don't think every person who smokes it is a total loser. I'm just sharing my experience with you. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Legalization would just support the idea that it doesn&amp;#39;t do any harm and getting high everyday is ok&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What people seem to forget, is that we have a perfect example of what happens when drugs are legalized right in front of us, and that is alcohol. When alcohol was legalized, did everyone drink alcohol everyday and think that alcohol was completely safe? No. The same will happen for cannabis in fact more information will be available about the drug, because it will be easier to gain permits to use in studies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another thing you need to understand to have your view changed, is addiction. There is mental addiction as well as physical addiction. The rate at which cannabis users get addicted to cannabis physically, is around 10 percent. For alcohol, it&amp;#39;s around 15 percent. That means that you know 5% more alcohol addicts than you do weed addicts. Chances are you know possibly a few alcoholics, and the people litterally addicted to weed are much less than even that number.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also ask yourself, is there anything wrong with using a drug everyday? Why? If you answer, because its bad, how do you know? Multiple studies have shown that marijuana is actually a Neuro-protectant and may possibly help with Neuron growth. Multiple people use SSRI&amp;#39;s perscribed by doctors every day, which can cause tonnes of harm to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Life is about enjoyment, fun, happiness. We only have a certain amount  of time on this planet, is if fair that we have to work? Why do we have to work? to pay off debt that the government makes in a way. (this is a whole other topic) But basically, if they are happy and enjoying life, who cares?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider is the harm that alcohol does to others. Never will a person beat their wife or children because of being high, but that can be very prevalent in alcoholics. Alcoholism causes fights and violence, cannabis does not. Alcoholics get brain damage as well as liver damage, their is no evidence for brain damage from cannabis for people over 18. So don&amp;#39;t only look at the physical effects on the person, look at the effects of those around them as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;While abusing any substance is bad, I challenge the premise that it&amp;#39;s easier to slip into cannabis dependence than alcohol dependence. Going out to bars, drinking at parties, on holidays, with meals, these are all common and socially accepted behaviors. While cannabis enjoys growing support in the US, it is still seen as taboo by many. I can call up pretty much anyone I know and say &amp;quot;want to grab a drink?&amp;quot; But I can only call a handful of people and say &amp;quot;want to smoke?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would also challenge the idea that using alcohol is somehow less dangerous than using cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Firstly, in 2010 the rate of alcohol induced deaths, &lt;em&gt;excluding&lt;/em&gt; homicide and accidents, was &lt;a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/alcohol.htm""&gt;25,692&lt;/a&gt;. The number of deaths attributed to marijuana overdose is &lt;a href=""http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/Causes_of_Death#sthash.eFOl670x.dpbs""&gt;zero&lt;/a&gt; every year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is because alcohol becomes toxic if you ingest about six-times the intoxicating dose. Marijuana, on the other hand, has the toxic dose estimated at about 10,000 times the intoxicating dose. (&lt;em&gt;Illegal Drugs&lt;/em&gt;, Paul Gahlinger).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So from a practical social standpoint, cannabis does less harm than alcohol. But what about it&amp;#39;s addictiveness?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In fact, while there is evidence that cannabis can cause a psychological dependence, &lt;del&gt;it does not cause a physical one. This is because the &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens#Addiction_and_drug_use""&gt;nucleus accumbens&lt;/a&gt;, the brain&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;reward center,&amp;quot; does not have THC receptors, so using cannabis does not create the same physical dependence behavior as the use of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens#Addiction_and_drug_use""&gt;cocaine, heroine, nicotine, and alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, all of which excite the reward center.&lt;/del&gt; [1]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What about when it&amp;#39;s time to kick the habit?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look at the physical effects of detoxing from alcohol dependence. I&amp;#39;m just going to bullet point this one from &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism#Alcohol_withdrawal""&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal can be fatal if it is not properly managed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased stimulation of the GABAA receptor results in tolerance and physical dependence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person&amp;#39;s nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here are the worst withdrawl symptoms I could find for &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_dependence#Diagnostic_criteria""&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;insomnia, cravings, restlessness, loss of appetite, difficulty concentrating, sweating, mood swings, raise in temperature, depression, irritability, and anger.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, while those are definitely negative, they are no where near the drawbacks to kicking alcohol. The bottom line is that, on every front, alcohol addiction is more dangerous and more damaging in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit[1] thanks to &lt;a href=""/u/Hatious""&gt;/u/Hatious&lt;/a&gt; for point out that there &lt;a href=""http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/teaching-packets/brain-actions-cocaine-opiates-marijuana/section-iii-introduction-to-drugs-abuse-cocaine-opia-11""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt; THC receptors in the nucleus accumbens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0

CMV: I don't have a problem with the U.S. torturing people.,"Recently in the news the C.I.A. and Bush administration have been under a lot of heat for torturing prisoners. In the grand scheme of things, what are a few lives compared to the safety of thousands of others. The people they are torturing are a global threat; it's not out of patriotism that I'm trying to justify this for the sake of protecting good old 'murica.   I think the main argument against me would be that there's a chance that some of these people may be innocent. But if someone came up to me, and said three other people and I need to be tortured because only one of us is a terrorist and it's either the four of us or potentially thousands of others, I would volunteer in a heartbeat.   I am already well aware the government spends billions of dollars on military related things that the public has no idea about, and I'm okay with that because I understand that those are keeping us safe.  I think my overall opinion is that it's good to be a good person and cooperate with people, but you also have to understand there are people who you can't negotiate with and you just have to kill (or torture) them.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have stated the torture doesn&amp;#39;t work, and that the process of torture isn&amp;#39;t held accountable because it&amp;#39;s all done in secret.  I agree with all of that. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But just for a thought experiment: What if torture did work?  And what if it was done transparently?  What if questions of &amp;quot;Should we torture suspect A about case XYZ with method BCD?&amp;quot; were put in a referendum and everyone voted on it?  I&amp;#39;m trying to strip away the realities surrounding torture that (thank god) make it impractical and focus on the question - can you do something extremely horrible for a chance at greater good?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the fact that it doesn&amp;#39;t work? Some people might agree that it&amp;#39;s justifiable to torture a terrorist if he has the codes to a bomb that will go off in a few hours and that&amp;#39;s the only way to get them. But I doubt it&amp;#39;s very justifiable if you don&amp;#39;t know who the terrorist is, you don&amp;#39;t know if you even have the terrorist, and you don&amp;#39;t know which of the twenty people who gave you the codes after you tortured them to believe because people will say anything to get you to stop hurting them. Not only is the bomb still almost certainly going to blow up, you just tortured 19 (or 20, because who knows if you even got the terrorist?) innocent people. Worse, maybe if you&amp;#39;d been nicer to them, they would have given you useful information that could have lead you to, for example, the bomb manufacturer, which they certainly won&amp;#39;t do now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: I believe that our legal system is built on a capitalistic model which removes the fairness factor.,"It seems to me that our legal system is built on a capitalistic model. If a lawyer is really good with a proven track record they can charge more money than other lawyers who don't have such a good record. This seems to indicate to me that the people who can hire these more expensive lawyers are increasing their odds that they will have a more favorable outcome of any litigation. Say someone is being sued by someone else who has a lot of money and they hire a lawyer who has won 95% of his cases and with the first person who can't afford such a high caliber lawyer, wouldn't the odds be slightly in favor of the more seasoned lawyer with a proven track record?

CMV: I believe that all these Zoolander 2 related posts that make it to the front page today are part of an elaborate marketing plan and were manipulated to the front page.,"How likely is it that Zoolander 2 related posts are naturally having over 20k upvotes over the first five, front page posts?    I believe that this is an elaborate marketing strategy organized by a PR team to make the promotion of the film seem ""organic"" instead of a forced advertisement.  This can only be achieved by vote manipulation-- which is a violation of Reddit's terms of service-- so they either working against Reddit's terms of service or are in cahoots with Reddit to pay for the placement.  This type of advertising is becoming more and more common on platforms such as Reddit, because it makes the marketing message feel warmly recommended by the community referral instead of an invasive pop-up.  Furthermore, as part of PR damage control, not only are Zoolander posts being actively upvoted, but I believe anti-Zoolander posts are actively being downvoted.  CMV that Zoolander posts today aren't part of a large marketing conspiracy disguised as a natural occurrence.   EDIT: Thanks everyone for the responses. Feeling defeated by a wall of comments and at this point I am willing to concede my conspiracy theory.   A few users have convinced me it may be possible to spread a marketing message without relying on vote manipulation if executed correctly.   I can only draw circumstantial evidence (at best) that this particular stunt was helped unfairly, and it's always easier to ask conspiracy questions that cannot be answered. I suppose Whether or not these early votes were tampered with in the end doesn't matter anymore because the PR stunt was executed so precisely and purposefully it would have spread regardless.   I may not have awarded deltas correctly on mobile but will check again when I get home later tonight.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

What better place to announce this than fashion week in Paris, which is one of the largest gathering of models in the world? Doing this would obviously generate huge amounts of publicity for Zoolander 2 (which it has), which then results in people sharing things related to Zoolander 2 all over the internet, including on reddit.

Always. It is the factor we could never control, and struck with devastating effect. But when was the last epidemic of a flu that killed millions of people I ask? 1920ish? Medicine has come a long way. Diseases have been eradicated. Treatments are getting better. Health standards are increasing. And a smarter population leads to smarter choices when it comes to health and hygiene. For example, we know not to eat dried fruit bats off the floor, because that gives you Ebola. And we know not to have sex with people with AIDS. And we know not to sit behind an x-ray all day. Things like that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of nukes, nuking someone isn&amp;#39;t really viable unless it&amp;#39;s a particularly extreme act of terrorism. War is not (no longer anyway) profitable, and is very problematic for a lot of big super powers. Say for example Russia Nuke America, destroying it completely. What would be the point? All trade will cease with America, causing huge problems for Russia economy. All of America&amp;#39;s allies will retaliate against Russia, causing more problems along the way. Even Russias ally&amp;#39;s will suffer, because THEY traded with the US as well. Nuclear war is not viable. It is stupid to even consider it. Everyone knows that trade is king. Nobody wants to stop trade. Trade has propelled civilizations to power, sprung entire religions into being, and made and broken empires for thousands of years. That is not about to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Famine and lack of fresh water and over population are complicated problems, but I will try to explain. We will never run out of food. It&amp;#39;s just a fact. Even if every farm on the planet was run out of business we will find a way to grow food because we NEED to. Consider this, real modern farms yield a 200% increase with just 1% of the water used compared to traditional farms. If we evenly distributed food across the entire world (Taking out spoiling and transportation of course) we can feed people a steady 2,400 calories a day (last I read). This includes people in countries with little agriculture infrastructure. 2,400 is a very good amount. Now imagine we double up tradition farms with the hyper efficient modern farms. 2,400 + 200%? That&amp;#39;s an insane 7,200 calories per person. And Modern farms take up a tiny fraction of the land space as farms, and you can technically have skyscrapers dedicated to farming, meaning the calories can shoot up potentially infinitely. I believe they already have farming skyscrapers in Japan, so it&amp;#39;s totally a thing! This is all without delving into the infinite possibilities of harvesting insects for calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, we are running out of fresh water. But you&amp;#39;re also forgetting we have machines that can purify water. Again, 500 years is a lot of time to refine a method to get it done more efficiently and on a bigger scale. But as the same with food, if we need water, we will GET water. Not to mention aquifers that have not yet been tapped. (I believe there was one discovered in Sub Saharan Africa within the last few years. It&amp;#39;s huge man) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And over population, is not a big deal. The Earth is big. People don&amp;#39;t seem to realize how big it is. You can fit the entire human population of Earth, shoulder to shoulder inside down town San Francisco. We&amp;#39;re fine. Nobody is worrying about it because more people equals more innovators. More tax payers. More consumers and producers. If there is a need for more housing, we will deal with it somehow. It&amp;#39;s the least of our worries really. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ice ages and hot periods are a funny one... Hot periods are clearly our doing this time around. But the atmosphere will level out as we become more green in the next 100 years or so. We have done damage that can&amp;#39;t be repaired sure, but it won&amp;#39;t be a death sentence. And maybe life will find other opportunities in the new warmer climate, you never know. We may even become carbon positive as a species, and accidentally create a global cooling crisis. 500 years is a long time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s the point here, 500 years is a really long time. It&amp;#39;s more than enough time to solve all of our problems we have today. In fact, it wouldn&amp;#39;t surprise me to know that people 500 years from now will laugh at our puny problems and then whimper at the huge complicated problems they have that we can&amp;#39;t even comprehend. Think about it, if the Earths population increases as much as it has, we will have more innovators, more young people to invent solutions to our problems. I have no worry about the future. We are now aware of the problems we are causing to our planet. We will sort it out. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a strangely fun thing to imagine these sorts of situations, and I think it&amp;#39;s actually quite healthy to do in some ways. It helps us imagine the greatest risks to our society, how we can improve our chances, and what we should be sincerely worried about.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While humanity is - in general - experiencing a level of health, wealth, and stability that we really haven&amp;#39;t experienced at any point in the past, this comes with its own set of problems. First off, we have never experienced the kind of population growth that we&amp;#39;re experiencing today, and each person&amp;#39;s lifestyle demands more resources from the earth than it ever has. So we have more people demanding more resources. That&amp;#39;s the part where you start talking about food shortages as a result of population increase.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To be sure, food is going to be a serious consideration in the future. However, with genetically modified organisms and advanced farming techniques our agricultural surpluses are the highest they&amp;#39;ve ever been, which is why we can sustain 7 billion people and counting. It&amp;#39;s also important to remember that these advances often grow exponentially. As the population increases and more people are given access to education, our ability to create larger and larger agricultural surpluses tends to increase as well, as we have more minds working on these problems. It works dialectically.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That said, the introduction of manmade climate change is going to be a new challenge. Previously fertile land will be made largely infertile. &lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, the growing periods in Northern regions are going to increase while this happens. Whether or not that will make up for the loss of agriculture in other regions isn&amp;#39;t a certainty, but it&amp;#39;s worth considering that climate change will affect different parts of the world differently. Nordic tundra areas might gain more farmland and freshwater. To be sure, freshwater will be an issue, with the rapid pace of technological advancement, more efficient means of cloud-seeding and desalination are not beyond our scope.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for the mention of nuclear war, that threat is diminishing consistently. War is a very different thing nowadays, and there is much less of it than there has ever been in our history. As a military tactic, well-respected commanders like Colin Powell have said nuclear weapons aren&amp;#39;t particularly useful. Furthermore, despite what we may see in the news, the world is a much more stable place today than it really ever has been. Now, humanity never had the ability to wipe itself out until 70 years ago, so we really can&amp;#39;t tell what will happen. However, war is not something that occurs internationally so much as &lt;em&gt;intra-nationally&lt;/em&gt; nowadays, and paramilitary groups are not likely to use nuclear weapons in their own cities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A very important theory to consider here is called the &amp;quot;21st century bottleneck.&amp;quot; This is essentially the idea that if society can hold it together through the 21st century, our population will stabilize at about 10 billion and stop increasing. That requires poor countries to continue getting richer, however, as populations tend to stabilize as people get richer. However, looking at economic growth worldwide you&amp;#39;ll see that the fastest growing economies are, in fact, in the Global South. We are curing diseases, providing education, and improving agricultural techniques which allow a middle class to grow in these poorer countries. As Bill Gates continues to point out, things are actually going very well in poor countries, which is going to help global stability in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Right now, we&amp;#39;re relying on the development of new technology to face the challenges posed by our current lifestyles. That may not be a bad idea, as the other option is to simply revert to a population and lifestyle that isn&amp;#39;t conducive to an advanced society. We can&amp;#39;t simply stop using fossil fuels tomorrow or else our society will fall apart completely, so the hope is that we&amp;#39;ll be able to develop advanced forms of energy, as well as techniques to help us cope with the environmental changes that will occur as a result. If nothing else, humanity is adaptable. If we can just get by the 21st century, things really should stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All in all, I think the better statement would be to say &amp;quot;human society as we know it may not make it through the next hundred years,&amp;quot; rather than the arbitrary 500 year mark. If we do make it past the 21st century bottleneck things are going to start looking up, mainly because of our immense rate of technological development based on increased population, access to education, and the exponential growth of technology. Remember it was only about 200 years ago that infant mortality rate in the &lt;em&gt;richest&lt;/em&gt; countries was worse than it is in the &lt;em&gt;poorest&lt;/em&gt; countries today. If these trends continue, we will develop new advances in health, agriculture, energy, and resource development that we need to really thrive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After that, it comes down to exploring and colonizing space, which is what many of our brightest minds are encouraging us to start thinking about now. The best way to assure the continued survival of the human race is to start moving off the earth, so that we needn&amp;#39;t rely on only one planet. Sadly, I don&amp;#39;t imagine that will be something that you or I will ever witness in our lifetimes, but there&amp;#39;s a good chance our descendants will benefit from the resources found outside of earth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;tl;dr I&amp;#39;m actually pretty optimistic. Technology and global trade are growing faster than we&amp;#39;ve ever seen, and that&amp;#39;s only going to help make things better.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;EDIT: I&amp;#39;ve ignored things like a meteor impact because they&amp;#39;re essentially impossible to predict. That said, with increased technology we can track space debris like never before, and that will help us should the need arise to avert a meteor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"CMV: If Portland can throw away 38 million gallons of water for no rational purpose, it should be selling water to California.","So a teenager (not known to be carrying a horrible plague) peed in a reservoir, and Portland responded by draining the entire 38 million gallon reservoir. I believe this to be extremely stupid insofar as a single human's bladder contents cannot contaminate 38 million gallons of water in any meaningful way, and also insofar as numerous animals already ""soil"" the water daily.  I hestitate to call the move criminally stupid only insofar as Portland claims it has such a surplus of clean water that it could easily drain the reservoir on a whim and refill it several times over (without any real environmental impact).  If indeed this is true, and Oregon can easily afford the water for such shenanigans, then surely it's thirsty neighbor would be willing to pay for some of this excess water. It seems unfair and inefficient for Oregon to pour its rivers into the ocean while Californians have so little water to go around (and so much money with which to buy water).  CMV. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, 38 million gallons isn&amp;#39;t really that much water.  &lt;a href=""http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-americans-underestimate-personal-water-usage-study-says-20140227,0,3836890.story""&gt;Americans use about 98 gallons of water per person per day&lt;/a&gt;, so that&amp;#39;s enough water for about 400,000 people for one day, or about 1% of California.  That&amp;#39;s not that much water.  Also, it&amp;#39;s over 600 miles to San Francisco from Portland.  That&amp;#39;s a long way to pump water.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next, &lt;a href=""http://dpw.lacounty.gov/wwd/web/Documents/WaterRates/MDRNon-Tiered2014-01.pdf""&gt;water in LA goes for $2.627/hcf&lt;/a&gt;, or less than a cent a gallon.  Even in a drought, water is cheap.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So what it comes down to is that the amount of water is minuscule, and  the water isn&amp;#39;t worth that much anyway.  Portland is right, it can afford to drain the reservoir, and it probably costs more to ship the water to California than California would pay for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;numerous animals already &amp;quot;soil&amp;quot; the water daily&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of diseases are species-specific.

Also why cannibalism is dangerous for the cannibal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know whether it actually matters in this case given that it&amp;#39;s one person and 38 million gallons of water, but worth noting nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"I believe society's development of the view ""Don't Judge Others"" is not practical and judging others is unavoidable in real life. CMV","Judging is defined as developing a negative opinion of another.  However, Judging others is unavoidable in real life.  If a person lies within my jurisdiction, that is, it involves me directly or indirectly, then I should be able to judge them with no societal discourse.  If a crazy girl who I barely know claims that God told her that we were supposed to get married, I don't say ""I shouldn't judge her, who knows what she's been through"" and cater to her fantasy by marrying her or entertaining her longing by leading her on.  I run away.  Fast.  I judge her immediately, and choose to stay away from her.  I am walking down the street with my child, and a windowless van pulls up and drives the speed we are walking.  The side door opens and a man asks my child if she wants to go for a ride and tells her he has candy for her.  I would never say ""I can't judge this person, who knows what he's gone through.""  No, fuck that.  I am judging him hard, probably beating the hell out of him out of fear of my child being kidnapped.  I know those are extreme examples, but judging others by their actions, presentation of themselves (not ""appearance"" because I don't judge based on race/creed/etc.), or words is completely acceptable as to choose who to associate yourself with or develop opinions about.  TL;DR - Judging others is unavoidable, therefore, if those who you judge are within your ""jurisdiction,"" judging them is completely acceptable and society's damning of the act of judging is impractical.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is just that you are using a straw man to encapsulate the entire view of society. If a man rapes and murders 16 children, we certainly do judge him. We say that he is a bad person, regardless of what awful thing he went through, because he is a bad person. Even if he was raped and tortured as a child, we judge his actions and his person. No reasonable person would say otherwise. What I think you are getting at though, is when people judge others based on a lack of information that lead up to some marginal action. Rape and murder is objectively bad-at least most would agree-stealing a loaf of bread is simply something that can be forgiven depending on what caused a person to steal. &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t judge others&amp;quot; is a platitude used to say &amp;quot;do not judge others imprudently and cursorily, because you are judging based on only what you know&amp;quot;. Prudent judgement is encouraged, we even have an institution for it, the Justice system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one is saying that you shouldn&amp;#39;t use available information to make as informed a decision as possible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The warning against judging is meant in the sense of &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t be judgement&amp;quot;- i.e, don&amp;#39;t jump to conclusions about people&amp;#39;s motivations or characters based on insufficient information.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some examples: You are picking a babysitter.

A judgmental person may exclude the person with the tat - but it turns out the tatoo is in memory of a child she cared for who died of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some will judge someone who got divorced as a poor judge of character or unable to maintain a commitment.

I think the popular show The Big Bang Theory is the pinnacle of stupidity. CMV.,"I've seen a few episodes, much to my chagrin, and I fail to even crack a smile. It's always just ""Here's a thing that means something! Some people don't know what it means!""  ***AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA***  I just can't see how this is comedic. Especially after seeing videos like   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKS3MGriZcs   and   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjMWnOezGU0   I almost feel the BBT is trying to be a parody of funny things, and failing at that.  So I'm open to hearing how and when BBT is funny, but so far I just don't see it.  Edit: So the general response is that I don't see the intelligence behind it because I didn't invest into learning about the series - I've never watched a full season, for instance, so i can't appreciate the quirks that characters have. This is a fair point.  I will watch some of the first season to try and get a better understanding of it. I argued that even without an investment, I should be able to recognize intrinsic humor, but this is not a guarantee and is not some formulaic way of making a successful comedy, so I retract it and admit that BBT may have its smart moments that would only be recognized with a deeper understanding.  So my view has been partially changed - I still think that it's an unintelligent show, but it's probably not the dumbest one. We do have 'Honey Boo-Boo' and 'Jersey Shore' to compete with, after all.  Because people keep mentioning this, I never expected to have people change my view on whether or not I *like* the show, that would be ridiculous. It was about seeing a more intelligent side to the show. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the humour in the show is pretty shallow in my opinion but there are also some really great moments...such as: Howard dungeon master impressions: &lt;a href=""http://youtu.be/QewfNt_RX28""&gt;http://youtu.be/QewfNt_RX28&lt;/a&gt; Howard accidentally takes estrogen: &lt;a href=""http://youtu.be/uBW8KsbmNlY""&gt;http://youtu.be/uBW8KsbmNlY&lt;/a&gt; Those are just a couple of examples of moments I genuinely laughed at...

CMV: When people are overweight there should be much more pressure to change.,"So I love the idea of cultural acceptance and all of that, but when people are overweight to the point of it being unhealthy I think that there should be a constant social pressure for them to change.  Especially due to the rising health concerns in America there should be a much heavier focus on trying to get healthy. Now that's not to say there should be ""fat shaming"" or something like that.  Picking on someone for their weight is unacceptable, but accepting obesity as normal simply rises to them seeing it as acceptable, and then their convincing their children it is acceptable, when it really shouldn't be.

Plenty of people know that being overweight is bad for their health, plenty of people shame themselves or try to apply pressure to themselves to change, and it&amp;#39;s not always effective. Society applying more pressure will not likely make the situation better for these people, and would likely make it worse. I&amp;#39;d also speculate that it would increase denial of being overweight, increase people who just flat out give up because its the only way to cope. If they can&amp;#39;t overcome the struggle in a reasonable time, the pressure just builds up until it becomes intolerable so what other choice do they have but to find a way to stop caring. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Society can help improve this situation most by being understanding. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean lying that being overweight is not a health problem, it just means you accept that ultimately you don&amp;#39;t have control over their weight, the most you can do is support them in whatever way you feel comfortable to enable them to overcome the problem. Accept the reality of the situation, no matter how hard society tries, short of extremely invasive or extremely undeniably wrongful behaviors, the person who has the most control to change it is the person dealing with it. The best you can do is help them to help themselves. You might think that society pressuring them does that, and I&amp;#39;m sure at least for some people more pressure could be what they need, but you have to acknowledge how it affects others as well and weigh that against other options.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Granted there are some people who look at it from a different perspective, in that some of the issues in being overweight do not quite come into full effect until in the older ages of life and some people don&amp;#39;t find those ages to be nearly as enjoyable and potentially not worth living for. I don&amp;#39;t see why society should tell them that they are wrong. If you have a problem with it producing increased burdens/costs, that&amp;#39;s not their fault, that is on society to decide how they might put those increased costs onto people who choose lifestyles that put additional costs onto society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting &amp;quot;pressure&amp;quot; on people to change isn&amp;#39;t going to help them accomplish their goal, it&amp;#39;ll just make them feel bad or nervous, or just &amp;quot;pressured&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s like saying we need to get a million likes on Facebook to stop breast cancer; it might &amp;quot;pressure&amp;quot; scientists to find a cure, but it isn&amp;#39;t going to find a cure.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not obese or overweight, but I&amp;#39;m willing to bet that those that are already feel a lot of societal pressures to change. The problem is that to lose weight you need to change make huge changes to your lifestyle, and the bigger you are the harder that is. A 500lb person can&amp;#39;t realistically start running/jogging without causing major damage to their knees. They need will power/motivation in order to control their diet, and to go out of their way to perform some exercise. Not only that, but they have to do it every single day until it becomes a part of their life. They have to change almost their whole life. That&amp;#39;s not easy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you feel that obesity is such a large problem that you want to help, then there are actual ways to do it besides making them feel pressured.

CMV:The recent cheating scandal involving teachers Atlanta is not the fault the convicted teachers but instead of high standards placed by standardized testing and thus the teachers should not be convicted,"Link to article for those unaware: http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/14/us/georgia-atlanta-public-schools-cheating-scandal-verdicts/ A long read, but worth it if you have the time: http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/21/wrong-answer  Recently 9 teachers in Atlanta were sentenced for their roles in a large coordinated cheating effort involving elementary and middle schoolers and their standardized tests. Some of these teachers have been sentenced to jail for 7+ years and many fined upwards of 50k. I believe that while it may be easy to simply blame these teachers, it is more important to understand why these teachers felt the need to cheat. They did so because of the high stakes placed on the schools by NCLB (No Child Left Behind). These put immense pressure on teachers to get their students test scores up and instead don't allow teachers to focus on the individual needs of each student. I also believe that the punishment given is far too strict. Yes, what the teachers did was wrong, but it is not worth of 7+ years in Jail.

This is equivalent to saying that a judge&amp;#39;s job is to uphold the law as written, not to reinterpret it the way they think ti should be; the police&amp;#39;s job is to enforce the law is written not to apply their own best judgement about whether an action is &amp;#39;really&amp;#39; a crime. Teachers are not entitled to change the outcomes of the tests given to our students. Those tests, wrongly or rightly, are there for accountability and circumventing that accountability says that teachers know better than the communities we serve. Let&amp;#39;s be honest - we actually MIGHT know better than the community but that is ABSOLUTELY NOT our decision to make.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Teachers can offer parents guidance in opting their children out of these exams. Teachers can refuse to administer these exams. Teachers can beg and plead or stand up and scream against these exams publicly and intelligently until the community realizes the mistake it has made by allowing these preposterous funding rules to continue. But cheating on the exams is not a valid form of protest; it is a dishonest attempt at circumventing the consequences that the community has chosen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, I know - the people who wrote NCLB do not have hungry kids attending broke-ass Atlanta public schools - they have smarmy rich kids attending private institutions or sterling public academies in wealthy districts. That is a Problem. But it is not a problem addressed by these teachers&amp;#39; actions. In the fight for justice for our students, the absolute worst thing that teachers can do it lie, cheat, and make ourselves look dishonest. What our profession needs is to be treated like a profession and what our students need is equitable educational policy - neither of which we can help to accomplish from the wrong side of a scandal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: I don't believe that ""minors cannot provide consent"" is a legitimate argument in support of statutory rape laws.","To preface, I am a teenager. Consider it from the horse's mouth. Also, I am in no way advocating statutory rape or pedophilia, I'm simply saying that this particular argument is illegitimate.  I believe that, for *sexually developed* minors, the argument that minors cannot provide consent is illegitimate. Teenagers have sexual libidos, and do have urges to participate in sexual intercourse.  I realize that particular *repercussions* of sexual activity may be unknown or may not be thought of by teenagers, hence why teenage pregnancy is a large concern. But when I see reddit comments on news articles about statutory rape, the comments seem to simply be ""minors cannot provide consent"" repeated ad nauseum. It seems to have become more of a catchphrase rather than a coherent argument. Why *can't* minors consent? Why does the threshold for having the mental ability to consent begin at 16-18? I understand it in a legal sense, minors can't legally consent until they turn a certain age, but the justification for that seems to be the same argument, and it becomes cyclical.  CMV, reddit.  EDIT 2:40PST I'm on mobile right now, but I'll respond when I get home. Great responses. Lots of deltas. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

In a perfect world, we would be able to set levels that perfectly match the individual and the circumstances.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when dealing with a legal system for millions of people, you have to deal in abstractions.  This means you need to set these limits at a level that tries to cover the larger majority of cases.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Certainly there are many people who are 17 and completely able to consent, while there are likely some who are 19 or 20 and could use additional protection.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t just the case with age of consent either, but things like Blood Alcohol Level Limit for DUI or Speed Limit.  Some people can drive fine above the legal limit, while other people&amp;#39;s limitations are below the limit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However in the end, society needs to place the line somewhere and this is where it is chosen.  The numbers shift a bit in different states, but there is general agreement about where the line is drawn.

It&amp;#39;s to protect minors from being exploited by adults.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Teenagers having sex is perfectly fine, so long as they&amp;#39;re having sex with people who are considered at the same maturity level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: The behavior 9/10 times from parents in restaurants make me furious,"**Edits:** - Title should be 9/10 times from parents *with children*  - The 9/10 is obviously not empirical evidence, I didn't keep a journal of this at work. This is what it felt like to me. ""More often than not"" would probably be more accurate.  - To add clarity to my view: Obviously there is going to be *some* mess when anyone eats out. Restaurant staff obviously doesn't expect a pristine table. However, as an adult I wouldn't just dump my food on the floor when I'm done with it, or squirt ketchup over everything just because I'm bored.  - What I don't understand is why so many parents seem to think it is perfectly okay for their child to exhibit this behavior at a certain age and they make no effort to help when their child does do this. When I was a child I only went to ""kids places"" as a very young person, and when I was about 6 years old I very quickly learned what was acceptable and what wasn't in restaurants. If I did spill/drop something, my parents would help clean it up.  - Something I have always found interesting is dog owners bringing their dogs into restaurants. The dogs are ALWAYS well behaved and quiet (sometimes I didn't even realize they were there), but they respond really well to anyone wanting to pet them. If a dog can't behave in the restaurant, they simply don't go into the restaurant until they can behave properly. Clearly we wouldn't accept someone just bringing their dog into a restaurant off leash and letting them run around, why is this okay for children (not the leash part, the running around part)?  ---  The below will probably sound like a rant, but I really am looking for someone to offer me some perspective and a different point of view. As a person without children, my understanding is that there is some reasonable explanation that I'm just not aware of.   Was a server for the first 10 years of my professional career, and 9 out of 10 times parents with young children seemed to me to think that going to a restaurant is their opportunity to 'relax and take a break'.   They would simply just stop parenting and couldn't possibly care less about the workers or customers in the restaurant. My understanding is that this is because they believe it is the server's job to clean up the huge mess that their child just made. And since they have a child, other customers should just deal with how their child is acting because that is how children are.   **Examples:**  - Crackers and other food all over the floor just left there with no effort to clean it up  - Various sticky things left on the table. Spills, spit/drool, etc..  - Letting their kids literally run around the restaurant  - Just letting kids cry (extremely loudly) and doing nothing about it  - Letting kids pull sugars out of carriers, tear them up, and just dump them wherever they want  - Same thing with salt and pepper shakers, just tip them upside down and pour salt/pepper everywhere  **What causes me confusion about this:** - Sometimes the parents where just obviously rude people, but in most cases the parents were otherwise nice and courteous people. It was just with their child that they stopped being considerate. They weren't sloppy and rude themselves, but they don't teach any of this to their child.  - I worked at a normal restaurant that didn't specifically cater to children like Chuck e Cheese or Bullwinkles.  - The 1/10 parents actually **did** make every effort to teach their children manners, would remove a child from the restaurant that was crying, and would make reasonable efforts to clean up messes.  - For most of the parents, I would assume that if they were at a friend's house, they wouldn't let kids do these things.  My view right now is that these parents just see servers as less important than they are, and therefore are not deserving of any kind of respect or consideration. They also feel that their child is ""special"" and everybody should cater to the parent and the child. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Kids are a bit messier than the average person, but my experience was nothing like what you described.  Yes, it requires a bit more work, maybe I&amp;#39;d have to hokey under the tables after they left, wipe down the table more thoroughly, and have more napkins to throw away, but I think these are well within our job description as servers.  A very small child (3 and under) lacks the coordination to eat orderly, and even older children are more prone to spills than the average adult.  Ultimately, we already have the rag and sanitizer, the broom/hokey and in extreme cases, the vacuum cleaner that will reduce our workload to seconds (a minute max). EDIT:  Compare that to parents who would have to bother us for extra napkins and then struggle to clean the table with inadequate cleaning supplies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As far as keeping kids in check, most parents in my experience were really good about taking crying babies out of restaurants, keeping kids at or near the table, and not bothering others.

CMV: The only reasonable thing to do for people from countries not directly involved in an international conflict is to stay neutral,"I'm originally from Russia, but I moved to America a few years ago. I've been thinking about the conflict in Ukraine a lot. I've been arguing about it with my Russian and Ukrainian frieds for months. Even thought I don't approve how Russia handles this situation, I think that its actions are infinitely more reasonable than what the American media might make you think.  I strongly believe that most people from other countries have no idea what they are talking about when they discuss it. /r/worldnews makes me sick: so many highly upvoted comments are made by people who clearly know nothing about Russia, Ukraine or Crimea.   It made me think about my reactions to other international conflicts. What do I know about Syria, Egypt, Tunisia?  So my opinion about the war in Palestina is that I have no opinion. Whatever I say about it would probably be totally wrong and stupid.  To change my view, please explain how to determine with a reasonable level of confidence who's wrong and who's right in a conflict involving two countries (or two parties within one country) somewhere far far away.

Very rarely does international relations boil down to &amp;quot;who&amp;#39;s wrong and who&amp;#39;s right&amp;quot; on &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; topic.  More often than not, both sides in a conflict have done things that have rightly made the other side upset.

For decades, the US (as well as the UK, France, and the other G7 countries have been major players on the international stage in conflicts that don&amp;#39;t directly concern them.  They will often serve as arbiters in these conflicts, facilitating the two (or more) conflicting parties to sit down with each other on neutral ground, such as in the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The issue I think you really have is with people making rash decisions while remaining ignorant of all of the facts, and that&amp;#39;s a fair criticism to levy.  Especially on reddit, people are wont to jump to conclusions based on biased readings of what little facts they have, as well as being very willing to make sweeping generalizations.  But as I&amp;#39;ve said before, these sweeping generalizations based on few facts are destined to be ignorant.  But the simple fact that &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; people are ignorant and fail to recognize the nuanced nature of international relations does not mean that it is improper for one who is well informed of the facts and is willing to take those nuances into account (and rarely, if ever, make any generalizations whatsoever) to make the complicated judgements about these situations.  Indeed, being able to assess the nuances of situations like those in Crimea and Palestine is necessary for the function of the diplomatic machine -- if we are ever to have peaceful resolutions to these conflicts, then these complex judgements are a necessity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"CMV: The current structure of the military, where soldiers are unaware of why people deserve being fired upon, is morally indefensible.","edit: seems like I didn't know enough about army protocols when posting this. I won't delete it but you are more than welcome to downvote this post to oblivion.  ***  Let me preface this by saying that one of the most common points in these types of posts seems to be that there are a few different types of soldiers, and the national guard and such tend to help people. This isn't about those soldiers. This is about soldiers that kill people.  Now, as far as I understand (and if I get something completely wrong, please point me to resources I can read to correct my misconception(s)), most of the time soldiers aren't really sure why they are killing people. So what happens is, an order is given, soldiers get sent out, and they must make a choice: a)shoot people or b)be court marshaled (or c) do their best to make it look like they are contributing whilst racking up as few casualties while staying safe as possible).   Choice a) means the soldier values their non-court-marshaled life as being more important than the entirety of the life of the person they are shooting at to kill. If the person they are shooting at has killed one or more other people, it's a less cut and dry question but as far as I understand, the soldier is unaware of the killcount of the person they shoot at. It is therefore difficult, if not impossible, for the soldier to act in a moral fashion consistently. Soldiers may or may not act morally even if given the choice, but that's a different issue: here, it seems, they are not even given the choice.  Outside of refusing to go to dangerous areas and being court marshaled for it, c) seems like the most moral choice to make but I feel like soldiers shouldn't have to do that--they should be debriefed on the latest intelligence on how many people everyone (or as many people as possible) they encounter have killed before going on a mission and be given strict orders to use non-lethal methods when dealing with everyone else. If this becomes impossible to do while staying safe, the mission should be aborted and re-planned. Commanders who mislead their troops should face some kind of punishment.  So the TL;DR is that soldiers are people, and people killing people who haven't killed others (or have been a direct cause of the death of others) or are unaware of whether the person they shoot at has killed other or not, is immoral and should not be done.  CMV.  ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re starting from a bad premise. &lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=rules%20of%20engagement%20ISAF""&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a list of current ROE protocols&lt;/a&gt; which lay out the rules of engagement. The TL:DR is that you need two things to use any force.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive Identification of the target, AKA PID. PID is non-negotiable. You must positively identify the target, at a very minimum this means if you can positively identify muzzleflash coming from a window, you can put small arms (I.E. not rockets or grenades) into that window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hostile Act OR Hostile Intent. Man placing an IED, that you or an adjacent unit can clearly identify as an IED? That&amp;#39;s a hostile act. Shoot. Guy comes around the corner with an RPG and begins to point it at you?

Ever. I personally stood before a JAGO with one of my Marines to defend the shooting of a 14 year old [kid had a fucking sniper rifle, and it took us a few weeks to pull the video from air assets] and he and I had to account for our actions, what we saw, why we fired, what our mission was, why we were out there to begin with. Every patrol starts with a patrol brief. Every warfighter knows exactly why they&amp;#39;re going there and where they&amp;#39;re going.

All of us bear that responsibility weather we pulled the trigger, or gave the orders, or put the weapon in the hand of the trigger-puller, or moved him to that location... whatever. We are operating in support of the guidance put forth by chain-of-command in support of whatever the defined end-result is. So you can&amp;#39;t morally separate out the trigger pullers from everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;they should be debriefed on the latest intelligence on how many people everyone (or as many people as possible) they encounter have killed before going on a mission and be given strict orders to use non-lethal methods when dealing with everyone else&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is more or less how it actually works.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;soldiers get sent out, and they must make a choice&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You want to be very very careful about creating a culture where the military will sit back and decide for itself when attacking is OK and when it&amp;#39;s not. Our job is to provide the credible force behind all options that the elected civilian leadership wants to consider. If people want the military to be used differently, they need to elect different leaders. If we drive a wedge between the elected leadership and the military members who carry out the orders, that&amp;#39;s just setting the stage for a military coup. As it is, every member of the military is briefed on what constitutes an unlawful order and is specifically expected to disobey any unlawful orders they receive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A helpful analogy is this: think of the military as an attack dog sitting in your yard. You want it to look very convincing and dangerous to passers by so that they know &amp;quot;there&amp;#39;s a house not to mess with&amp;quot;. But you DO NOT want it attacking on it&amp;#39;s own without orders.

CMV: I believe a fetus has rights worth protecting.,"I've long struggled with this and I'd like to here some strong arguments from the other side.

The argument was that if the zygote was ensouled during that time then it would be split in half. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another argument I heard was from a bio-ethicist. She reasoned that we decide the end of life with the cessation of brain activity and therefore it would be reasonable to begin life with the beginning of detectible brain activity, which is roughly 43 days IIRC.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, whether you believe in souls or not is something different, but I like that both of these arguments set a time frame in which it wouldn&amp;#39;t be unethical to view a fetus as more than a collection of cells. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"If I don't have any morning meetings and I stay at work later than others, I shouldn't be judged in the corporate world for preferring to stay up late and wake up late. CMV.","I know some companies have ""flex time"",  but they are decidedly and probably permanently in the minority. Most of the business world would judge me pretty harshly for this behavior and many places would fire me for tardiness.  I think this is a holdover from the work schedules of farms, factories and the military. It has no bearing whatsoever on my job or my performance, yet most corporate types would righteously call me lazy.  In trying to adapt to their schedule, I sit like a zombie through the morning hours and then feel groggy during what used to be my most productive time - late at night.  I am not a corporate malcontent. I like wearing suits and working in an office. I can totally accept that office politics are inevitable. I know why I have to have 3 bosses. I went to business school. I am good at this. But this one thing just kills me.  This is obviously a significant source of friction in my life and I would love it if someone could clear it up for me. CMV.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends on what exactly your job is. There are places where working the hours you describe is totally fine and accepted. But just because you have no morning meetings doesn&amp;#39;t mean you aren&amp;#39;t expected to be available to interact with coworkers, managers or customers. If you&amp;#39;re part of a team, its important that your working hours at least mostly overlap with those of your teammates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It completely depends on your job as if you have a job that involves working with other people most of the time it&amp;#39;s important to have a similar schedule. For example if everyone else in the team starts at 9 and finishes at 5 but you start at 10.30 and finish at 6.30, there would only be 5 hours out of the normal 8 hour working day that you will be available to work with the other team members.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another reason is that if this company has customer facing operations and something goes wrong in the morning (around 9am) they may need your help to resolve it, so your hours need to overlap with the expected customer support hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: Insults such as 'You're gay' are not an affront to gay people,"I've seen some discussion about this topic, where many kids and adults may call people something they aren't to try and insult them. For example: 'That's so gay' and 'You throw like a girl' type insults. Many people come to the conclusion that these type of insults are homophobic and misogynistic, but I don't believe that's necessarily the case at all.  I think the most insulting thing about being called a girl for a boy is the affront to his own identity. He is being called something he is not. He doesn't think its insulting because he hates girls and thinks they're inferior, but rather because his identity as a boy is being taken away.  Women in general also hate being associated with masculinity. They tend to want to be smaller than their partners because they feel masculine if they are taller. They religiously pluck facial hair and shave away body hair because that's manly. But they probably don't hate men.  Similarly, being called gay is a huge insult to many guys not because they are all homophobic, but because they are being called something they are not.  I think the best way to see it from my point of view is looking at how offensive it is for trans people when they are mis-gendered (Purposely). It is a deliberate refusal of their identity. No one says a trans woman is a misandrist if she hates being referred to as 'he'. The people calling them 'he' are also unlikely to hate men, but say it to hurt the trans person.   So CMV, insults such as those above aren't necessarily homophobic or misogynist. They sting because they are an affront to identity more so than because being gay or a woman is a bad thing.  _____  ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you be ok with an identity-based insult that you&amp;#39;re not already familiar with? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eg &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re so black&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re such a muslim&amp;quot;, in response to behavior stereotypically associated with these groups? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, being called gay is a huge insult to many guys not because they are all homophobic, but because they are being called something they are not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t think this is true at all.  Replace gay with another mistaken identity (Swedish, vegetarian, libertarian,  etc.) and it doesn&amp;#39;t carry the same negative connotation. Calling someone gay is in most cases specifically associated with pointing out that someone is exhibiting negative qualities that are stereotypically associated with homosexuality. No one is actually under the impression that their identity has been called into question in a serious sense. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling someone gay is homophobic because you are associating them with the stereotypical traits of gay people - effeminate, etc.   It has nothing to do with being called something you are not.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, I am Jewish.  Yet I would still be offended if someone said &amp;#39;You&amp;#39;re cheap like a Jew&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;You Jew&amp;#39;ed down the price.&amp;#39;  Despite them calling me something I am - Jewish - they are associating me with highly prejudiced stereotypes.   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Women in general also hate being associated with masculinity. They tend to want to be smaller than their partners because they feel masculine if they are taller. They religiously pluck facial hair and shave away body hair because that&amp;#39;s manly.

I believe animals have the same rights to life as humans and it is morally right to violently free them from farms. CMV,"The title sums it up just about. I’m a vegan and in my eyes, farms (especially factory farms) are glorified concentration camps. So liberating the animals by force must be a morally good choice just as forceful liberation of the Nazi concentration camps was. I guess I just want someone to convince me I’m an extremist and to moderate my views.  **EDIT:** It seems there have been two main arguments put forth:   1. Are wild animals wrong in eating meat too?  2. Humans need meat  And they can both be answered the same: Eating animals is wrong because it is **unnecessary.** If it were necessary I'd have no issues whatsoever (As with wild animals). But the fact remains that a degree of unavoidable objective suffering comes with the farming process, and it is totally unnecessary.  **EDIT 2:** Thanks for everyone's input. I got out of it what I posted for. I realise that direct action is probably too extreme and education is the way forward.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are actually several claims here. Let&amp;#39;s break it down:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Animals have the same rights as humans.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Situations where a human&amp;#39;s rights would be violated similarly violate an animal&amp;#39;s.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It is morally right to use violence in defense of individual rights.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first seems like a category error. So far as we know, animals do not have language, so the notion that they have a right to free speech is difficult. This shows the contradiction in the reasoning. Perhaps animals should have &lt;em&gt;some of the same rights&lt;/em&gt;, but they don&amp;#39;t appear to need &lt;em&gt;exactly the same rights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The second assumes that our empathy for animals is an accurate interpretation of their experience,  rather than anthropomorphism. However, anyone that&amp;#39;s owned a dog can see this isn&amp;#39;t really true. Dogs happily accept the collar and leash, but it would be a truly exceptional person that was willing to be led around in public that way. You would feel imprisoned by a cage, while a domesticated bird experiences it as a kind of security against predation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The third assumes there is no better way. Nearly every society eschews violence against people and their property whenever possible. Since you live in a Republic where it is possible to use advocacy to change the law, you are morally obligated to do so. Resorting to violence when others do not share your opinion is not generally acceptable, because you have many other alternatives in our society. It is only when no alternative exists that violence can be justified.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) While it isn&amp;#39;t a strict necessity, humans do depend on animal-produced proteins. Meat, eggs, milk etc. contain what is called &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_protein""&gt;complete proteins&lt;/a&gt;, while most plant-based sources would miss some vital amino acids in their protines.&lt;br/&gt; Now guaranteed, and as the wiki article suggests, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some vegan complete protein sources such as soy. But that wouldn&amp;#39;t be suitable as a replacement on a large scale, especially in overpopulated, undeveloped nations.&lt;br/&gt; So while you could do without animal products as a person in a modern country, it would be extremely hard to adapt for humanity as a whole, thus it is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) You&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;morally good&amp;quot; to use violence to liberate farm animals, but think about the other side; livestock farms are run by people, and if violence is employed there would be some human casualties. After all, those people depend on those farms for income.&lt;br/&gt; And even if the act of forcefully destroying their source of life-sustaining income (from their point of view) doesn&amp;#39;t lead to a clash, the farm workers would be out of a job, and if that was carried on a large scale the economy is likely to suffer, and press further on the world&amp;#39;s supplies of vegan alternatives.&lt;br/&gt; That and you have a bunch of grudge-holding unemployed people, which isn&amp;#39;t too good.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And though I agree with you that factory farms are horrible, I also think that farmers try to minimise unnecessary pain to the animal slaughtered.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On a side note, may I ask why did you chose to be a vegan and not a vegetarian? It seems to me that other products like eggs or cow milk cause no harm to animals if that was your reason.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: Anyone protesting for Michael Brown is automatically an idiot.,"I am extremely angered when I hear things like Michael Brown was executed. Cops are not secretly serial killers who are just waiting for a chance to get away with killing someone. But that's how these morons are portraying the police. I refuse to believe that a member of the police performed a public execution under scrutiny of other bystanders. The cop isn't mentally ill. His actions must done alongside of some kind of self interest. Shoot an innocent person who poses no danger in the head execution style in public? Really? What possibly way of reasoning could lead to that conclusion? I was 100% confident since the very break of the news that the cop was unlikely to have done anything wrong. These protesters automatically assumed the cop was in the wrong and refused to acknowledge new evidence.  I get pissed off that people think Michael Brown is still a saint after the video of him robbing the store was released. Retards insist that it has nothing to do with the shooting. It has everything to do with it. The reality is that Michael probably thought he got caught, and therefore, his interactions with the cop was likely to be extremely aggressive. I imagine it went something like-  Officer - Hey you're blocking traffic  Michael - I ain't rob no store you fucking pig.  Officer - I didnt say...  Michael - These cigars ain't from the store.  Officer - I didn't ask about....  Michael - Fuck all ya. Always tryin a hold me down  Officer - Ok put your hands in the air!  Michael - Fly high or die tryin!! YOLO!! AHHH [charges head first at cop and gets shot like a retard]  Seriously, if the cop was a sick fuck and gets a boner shooting up black people, he could have done so in a secluded area at night when no one was around. It would have been his word against the world, no witnesses. Somebody please explain to me why people protesting in favor of this dead thief isn't a moron. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The fuel has been gathering up for quite a long time with other (even more) clear cut examples of police brutality. I&amp;#39;m open minded and realize that what went down with Michael and the police officer is somewhat hazy, and does in many ways point to aggression on the part of Michael (initially). I get that. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, an anger has been building nationwide (again, with other examples) and when folks found out an unarmed kid was shot &lt;em&gt;six times&lt;/em&gt;, twice in the head, things tipped.

I believe that there is no logical argument for the protection of endangered species unless they significantly contribute to the ecosystem. CMV,"After reading [this](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/16/us-rhino-hunt-auction-winner-fears-for-his-safety/4517427/) article, I thought about people's reactions to the hunting of various endangered species such as black rhinos or sumatran tigers, and I came to the conclusion that these protesters are attempting to impose their own interests over others for no logical reason.  I don't believe that the value of a life is dependent on the number of existing lives left in that species. Extinction is a natural part of life and protecting endangered species can only be classified as a personal interest of these protesters, not some sort altruistic act to save the planet.  Therefore, I believe that there is no logical argument for banning the hunting of endangered species simply because they're endangered. CMV.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, all animals matter to the ecosystem. Sumatran tigers are apex predators, which means that they significantly contribute to the ecosystem even if there are only a few of them. It only takes a few tigers to control the population of many species that are lower on the food chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those animals have great economic value. Black Rhinos are major drivers of tourism to eastern and central Africa. Since there are so few of them, they are worth millions of dollars per capita to the safari and tourism industry in the region. If hunters kill those tigers, they are stealing away those people&amp;#39;s livelihood without giving them adequate compensation. Even if they pay the government a fee, very little of that money actually helps the people on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extinction is a part of life the same way that death is a part of life. But it is still wrong to actively cause someone else to die (murder,) and it is wrong to actively cause a species to become extinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extinction of a species is a part of nature.  So is your death.  so is human suffering, murder, rape, etc.  Why why should we stop it?  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;unless they significantly contribute to the ecosystem  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ahhh, good point, but that would mean we need to know almost all of how the ecosystem works, and I am afraid we are not at that point yet.  I actually think we know very little.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So to protect an endangered species is to a) reduce our negative effect on the ecosystem (like preventing you form dying whenever possible, for example) and b) a safe bet that this creature might play an important role in the ecosystem we do not dominate yet.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV:People of mixed race shouldn't be referred to by only half/part of their race.,"A few people to consider.  Barack Obama-Half Kenyan/ Half Caucasian. Known socially as:Black.  Tiger Woods:Black, Asian, Indian, Caucasian. Known socially as:Black.  ~~Mitt Romney-European and Latino ancestry. Known socially as:White.~~  George Zimmerman-Half hispanic/ Half white. Known socially as:White.  Each of these people brings up an interesting side of biracial perceptions. It used to be that any race mixed with caucasian would automatically be cancelled out. Obama is half black, half white, but people call him black, Tiger Woods is an amalgamation of racs and people call him black.   However in recent years, these social rules seemed to change somewhat with racially charged cases like Zimmerman being referred to as white, despite having a ""darker"" race of peruvian ancestry from his mother's side. ~~Romney himself does not acknowledge as latino, even though George Romney was from Mexico, defaulting to white to appeal to his base.~~   What is the point of all of this? It's that our terminology for classifying people seems to be outdated as more and more biracial people have come into American life and we need to rethink the logic behind it.  Some might say that it's wrong to label people, but identity is important. Obama has written about how he struggled to decide whether he was white or black as a youth, a society that could barely understand the idea of mixed race forced him to choose between one side of his ancestry or the other, when he should have accepted both.   Tiger Woods calls himself ""Cablinasian"" or ""Multicultural."", which gives a fair homage to all sides of his family. Referring to someone who is biracial by only one of their races ultimately discredits one or more people who played a part in that person being alive. Whether it is done socially, ~~or whether it is done voluntarily like with Romney (which is still brought by social pressures.)~~, I think that this approach of categorization is fundementally wrong and illogical because it ultimately makes a person deny a big part of themselves and their family.   Instead of referring to someone of mixed race as one race, there should be new terms invented to better suit who they are. Wood's approach with ""Cablinasian"" and other variations such as ""Eurasian"" or simply ""Multicultural"" being accepted into mainstream culture would be of a great benefit and a welcome addition to the lexicon for a society becoming more and more multicultural by the day.  That's my stance, please change my view.  EDIT:Removed Romney.  EDIT #2:Been asleep for a while, so sorry I stopped responding. The feedback to my view has been pretty civil considering the subject, so I'm very happy about that. I appreciate everyone who contributed and I will definitely hand out a few deltas, or at least an upvote for people who took the time to post.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand why identifying as a particular colour is in any sense a way of choosing your identity. For example, I&amp;#39;m mixed (won&amp;#39;t say the exact mix to protect my anonymity, but it&amp;#39;s a somewhat complicated mixture). I&amp;#39;ve been mistaken for all sorts of things, though typically people think I&amp;#39;m latino or middle eastern (I&amp;#39;m neither). But you know how I identify myself if anyone asks? Third generation Canadian.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to go a bit further. Black is not a race. There are more races in Africa than in the rest of the world combined. Pygmies are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different from Bantu, even though both are listed as black. Even describing Obama&amp;#39;s father as Kenyan misses a lot. Was he Bantu or Nilotic or Cushitic? Something else? Black is a description, because most people don&amp;#39;t have much of a clue about the strong cultural and ethnic differences in parts of the world not their own.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How do you refer to Indonesians? Do you distinguish between the Javanese and the Sundanese? They sure do. These people have been distinct for much longer than the existence of any one of these modern countries. To identify a man by his country is not to identify him by his race. There are no racially homogenous countries. My guess is that most people in North America would call them Asians, but they&amp;#39;re all quite different from Chinese and Indians (though there are many Indians in Indonesia). And even talking about &amp;quot;Chinese&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Indian&amp;quot; is to lump together a range of ethnic groups more diverse than all of Europe. The differences between a Tamil and a Punjabi are gigantic. The Punjabi language is closer to English than to Tamil, because Punjabi and English are Indo-European languages whereas Tamil is a completely different language group: Dravidian.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But in any case, I think races are a total fiction. Like, completely made up. The example I give is that Alice of race A marries Bob of race B and they have four kids, Charlie, Christina, David, and Delilah. Charlie and Christina marry persons of race A, David and Delilah marry persons of race B, and they all have kids. All of Charlie and Christina&amp;#39;s descendants marry persons of race A, all of David and Delilah&amp;#39;s descendants marry persons of race B. So Alice and Bob&amp;#39;s great grandkids&amp;#39; great grandkids are each either 127/128 race A or 127/128 race B (if I counted that right). But the descendants of Charlie are just as closely related to the descendants of Christina, David, and Delilah... even though Charlie and Christina&amp;#39;s descendants are predominantly race A and David and Delilah&amp;#39;s descendants are predominantly race B.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, what happens after seven generations or so is that &lt;em&gt;the definition of race changes&lt;/em&gt;. Seven generations takes something like two hundred years. The people of today are not very closely related to the people of two hundred years ago, no matter who they are and who you are. No one of your ancestors from seven generations ago is related to you by more than one part in 128, if you assume no inbreeding (and eventually, there is some).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So my point is that race is a totally meaningless and fictitious label that doesn&amp;#39;t help you to understand anything at all about a person. Those three people you listed, even the one you retracted? I&amp;#39;d use &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; label for them. American.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the basic reason why we don&amp;#39;t do this is because humans are kind of dumb and we want to have just a few categories of people. It&amp;#39;s not a particularly encouraging reason and is kind of depressing and sad, but the real answer to &amp;quot;Why don&amp;#39;t we say multicultural?&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;It would confuse people.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another important thing to keep in mind is that while ancestry is also extremely important in determining race, race is somewhat of a fluid concept and what race people guess you are can have a lot to do with how you&amp;#39;re treated in the world. Obama, Romney, and Carlos Mencia all walk into a store. Who&amp;#39;s racially profiled to be more likely to steal something? Who gets told a golf joke by another patron? Who gets spoken to in Spanish? The other shitty thing about the world is your experience will be different depending on what you look like. And going back to point one, humans are kind of dumb and want to group people into categories they think they can understand. Using the limited language of black and white helps explain people&amp;#39;s experiences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: I don't think people should be able to opt out of being a presidential candidate.,"Because there are so many career politicians that know what they are doing and decide not to run for presidency, they may be harming us, because lots of other people who think they are not worthy are doing so as well.   Only people who are foolish enough to think they can run an entire country are doing so. Take the exchange of the president of Ecuador with John Oliver of Last Week Tonight as an example.  You may ask, will a person who is elected and doesn't want to take office just not do anything? And to that, I say no, because that would land the country in chaos. They would feel morally charged to do what they can, with the support of a nation saying that they probably can do the best job.  As many people have said, ""only a fool thinks he's a genius"".

I believe that systematic genocide like the holocaust could never happen in a country like the US. CMV,"I was talking to my friend about this recently, and he said that the US is not that different from how Nazi Germany was back then. If the economy is low, and people need (a) minorit(y/ies) to blame, and a charismatic leader gets up and gives them hope, they would stand by idly.  I told him that it's ridiculous primarily because we've witnessed the holocaust and the Japanese camps and we would be extremely alarmed if anything of that sort started again.  The conversation went on, but I still think it's ridiculous.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would point towards the internment of the Japanese in WWII. Sure it might be a long way from internment to killing and we did end up going back on our decision but I definitely think it&amp;#39;s possible. I wouldn&amp;#39;t expect us to do it outside of a time we are in war though for the reasons you mentioned... &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;we would be extremely alarmed if anything of that sort started again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But it seems that we take our most draconian measures in times of war and I, while thinking it is far fetched, could see this happening if the situation was set up perfectly. I don&amp;#39;t think that you could say it would never happen, you would be better off saying it&amp;#39;s highly unlikely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever watched the movie or read the book &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wave_%28novel%29""&gt;The Wave&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;? Its true a story about a high school teacher who was asked how the German people were able to let the holocaust happen. He in unable to give a satisfactory answer to the students, so he tries an experiment. In the following weeks he starts a &amp;#39;club&amp;#39; called The Wave and indoctrinates his students into it. He is able to get a large portion of the school to join and the school faculty is behind him despite the negative impact it has - e.g. it&amp;#39;s led to people not in the group to be bullied and harassed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He eventually reveals that he&amp;#39;s been using Hitler&amp;#39;s techniques to make the student body obedient and loyal to him and that the Wave was created to demonstrate how people are susceptible to Nazi-like propaganda. Anyone who had questioned the group they were dismissed or attacked, which is part of how his movement got as big as it did. No one saw the Hitler-connection until he pointed it out. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a good read (and it&amp;#39;s a short book, so it shouldn&amp;#39;t take long, or you can just watch the movie). When people get a sense of community and empowerment, they can rationalize some pretty terrible things. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
I believe that women's only hours at gyms are sexist and shouldn't exist CMV,In specific I attend a university where all students pay athletic fees in exchange for the use of school gym facilities. While I already think that this should be changed to an opt in/out system I am more interested in hearing reasons why women's only hours are defensible. This renders particular pieces of equiptment totally unavailable to male students (as they are only present in specific gyms) for hours during prime times throughout he day. So if one is  paying equal fees to all other students why is one not allowed equal access and how is this a good thing? Doesn't it simply perpetuate sexism?   EDIT: I appologize for the sentence where I use the term I. I am female and have taken advantage of these hours in the past I merely meant it to be sort of illustrative but it ended up being very unclear.  EDIT2: Hey all this post generated a ton of great discussion and showed me a lot of ways that my view lacked nuance. My view has definitely undergone some substantial change and I'll work on awarding delta's to those arguments. Thanks all!,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree they are unfair, but you have to realize almost EVERY inequality between men and women comes from one belief. And that is.......&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Men love sex. They can&amp;#39;t control themselves. Sex is the only thing men want. Women don&amp;#39;t like sex nearly as much as men. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, obviously this isn&amp;#39;t true. But it is a common belief held (to at least some extent) by most people. This is the reason men are praised for having sex and women are looked down upon. This is the reason female rape victims are taken a lot more seriously than male ones. And yep, you guessed it, this is the reason women have their own hours at the gym but men don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a lot of other people have stated, women ogle at men at the gym just as much as men to to women. But because of this social stigma, this is thought of as &amp;quot;creepy&amp;quot; for a man to do but almost sexy when a woman does it (especially if it&amp;#39;s to you). And because women are taught the whole &amp;quot;men can&amp;#39;t control themselves,&amp;quot; they&amp;#39;re basically taught to see men as threats. Men don&amp;#39;t have this. That&amp;#39;s why if a man is checking out a woman, especially if it&amp;#39;s in a place like a gym, her immediate reaction is that he&amp;#39;s a threat. He may hurt/harass her. That&amp;#39;s when the term &amp;quot;creep&amp;quot; is used. Like I said, men don&amp;#39;t have this. They don&amp;#39;t feel threatened when women stare at them like that. They can go to the gym without worrying about getting this uneasy feeling that women do. That&amp;#39;s why they don&amp;#39;t need their own hours.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So yeah, it all stems from these gender roles. And odds are, you&amp;#39;re contributing to them. So you can&amp;#39;t fight one of the solutions to these problems created because of the gender roles because you think it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;unfair&amp;quot; if you aren&amp;#39;t willing to stop contributing to the gender roles yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my perspective, as a man, and as someone who has gone to great lengths to understand situations like this from other people&amp;#39;s point of view: To me, it seems to be about basic safety and comfort. A lot of women feel uncomfortable being physically vulnerable in front of men, especially men that may be more physically fit, if not totally ripped. Many women have to deal with the fact that men can dominate them easily, physically, at any point in time, and having to deal with that fear in a place where they are trying to become stronger and more fit isn&amp;#39;t really fair. I&amp;#39;ve had the concept of &amp;quot;rape schedule&amp;quot; explained to me before, and to me, it makes sense; it&amp;#39;s the idea that rape statistics are so out of control in this country (and in most countries; this isn&amp;#39;t an &amp;quot;America is the rapiest place ever&amp;quot; thing), that many women feel they have to plan their lives around the conscious or subconscious fear of being raped or otherwise violated. It&amp;#39;s just a fact of life for many women in this country, and it&amp;#39;s a fact of life that does not dissipate as soon as one walks through the doors of a gymnasium. To that end, I absolutely feel that it&amp;#39;s appropriate to have a women&amp;#39;s only hour at the gym. Now, if the question is whether a men&amp;#39;s only hour should also be instated, well, that&amp;#39;s a valid point of discussion, but on the question of whether women should have a safe place to exercise and become more fit, more strong, and more physically capable, without fear of sexual judgment or objectification or god knows what else (considering these are fears many women have to live with for the other 23 hours of the day), I think that&amp;#39;s a completely justified policy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edited to add that of course, all of that having been said, the administration can and should do more to make the whole system egalitarian. My central point remains, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I don't think that dropping my Gifted 10th Grade Literature class for a regular english class is a bad idea. CMV,"I'm a Sophomore who finished Freshman year with As and Bs (with two gifted classes, Literature and Biology) I only learned I had this class the first day of school and did none of the required summer work because of this. ( I have until labor day to read two books, do two essays, and do two projects) A very significant Girl (to me) is in this class and I only have one other period with her and she is the only reason I haven't dropped it yet.  I would actually like to have this class, but the amount of work being piled on me is really stressing me out and it's only the first week of school. So, uh. CMV?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are only in the class it is better that you drop.

I believe the reason for the toxic community of League of Legends is because of the matchmaking system. CMV.,"League of Legends is a game I believed plays based solely on catching opportunities and be able to do very small micromanagement (I will explain these this point later), and in order to succeed in knowing both these categories and execute them well, one need to have experiences in the realm of League game play, in simpler term, in order to be good at League one just need to play the game, the more they play the better they get at it. But when the matchmaking system pair experienced players with inexperienced ones, both parties expectations are not met because of their differences in skills thus both parties rage at one another.  In my personal experience with the match making system, more often than not, I get paired with newer players who have much less experience in the game, to clarify here is my stats:  * 733 wins in normal  * 345 wins in ranked  * 720 game total in ranked   With a little over 1,400 games, anyone with similar experience would know where a ward should be place so that it would give the best vision, not just any place in the bush, it has to be in a certain area within the bush (top or bottom or middle of the bush depend on the the bush position in the map) and if a person is playing Alistar, they know to keep Riven away from the Adc. These are the very small micromanagement that I talked about, and having knowledge about these micro is a huge factor in deciding the game outcome.  Thus when an experienced player get into a team fight with the opposing team, he have a certain expectation of his team mates to do things that they are suppose to do. The key word here is expectation, every Adc expects their support to help them by either attacking the other priority target or by keeping the Dps and Assassin away from the Adc. Now again, these things are not taught in the tutorial and one must experienced it in the game in order to know this.  When a player fail to meet these expectations, ""rage"" happens. The question often is ""Why?"" ""why didn't you do this, why didn't you do that"", they asks this because each player have an expectation of what another player should be doing, and each person's expectations is different based on their skill level in the game. An Adc with 50 games under his belt expects his support to act differently than an Adc with 400 games under his belt.  The issue with the match making system is that it paired experienced players with newer ones and the gaps are tremendous, (often I find my self playing with team mates less than 100 total wins in ranked, some even less than 30) and it is unfair to veteran players to lose a game because someone else is learning the rope.  Rage can happen to both parties, the experienced player and the inexperienced ones, some of the things that veterans of League does in a game (initiation, expecting follow ups, go for priority target) some time does not make sense to the inexperience players and vice-versa, so both parties rage at one another for not meeting their expectations.  The issue with the matchmaking system have been on my mind for a while now, I do not know if there are logistic in place for the matchmaking system or if it just match anyone to everyone, I just felt that this is a good place to put my thoughts process out there to see if anyone else think the same and I welcome any other ideas that would say other wise. I posted this in /r/leagueoflegends and did not get much respond or even a counter argument, I am hoping that it would be different here.  Tl:DR: Match making system pair experienced players with inexperienced players and everyone rage at each other for not doing what was expected from one another.   Thanks everyone for commenting, and a special thanks to /u/stipulation and /u/A_Soporific for adding onto the fundamental cause for rage of League of Legends. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;While what you say is true, I disagree about the fundamental cause of the toxic community.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A. The game is just stupid long and people blame everyone but themselves for things going wrong because everyone just lost an hour of their lives. You&amp;#39;re against someone really good in lane but to your team, you&amp;#39;re a feeding &amp;quot;noob fag thundercunt&amp;quot; or some variation of that. When you start dying, you go and blame everyone else by saying things like &amp;quot;oh you didn&amp;#39;t ward exactly where I would have&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;omgwtf noob, I should get the buff because I need it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;B. It&amp;#39;s a team game. Some champs mesh better with others. Some people prefer certain roles. If I like playing ADC and I wind up as support, I&amp;#39;m more likely to be a condescending critical asshole and pick at every little mistake the ADC makes whether I verbalize it or not. Furthermore, I may end up being stuck in a role / champ I am not all that great with - everyone has an hour invested in this game so they&amp;#39;re being little pricks about me knowing the character in-and-out perfectly as if I had the time to do so like their unemployed asses so they rage about why I&amp;#39;m not playing perfectly and how they could do much better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although experienced with inexperienced is probably a contributing factor I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s one of the larger reasons. I&amp;#39;m going to repost something I threw up a while ago about why I think people rage in LoL:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;MOBAs in general create the worst player-base, simply by their nature. This can be seen in four easy reasons: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to see what everyone else is doing and it&amp;#39;s easy to see what they did wrong.&lt;/em&gt; You see everything from the same perceptive so you can critique other players in detail and KNOW they messed up (even as you mess up yourself)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your success depends entirely on the team.&lt;/em&gt; Unlike other games it&amp;#39;s not about you doing well; your personal score counters for shit if you don&amp;#39;t win the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asymmetrical positions.&lt;/em&gt; A good support score is not equal to a good AD carry score. Thus the person with the best score on the team might be the worst player. Thus there&amp;#39;s no objective way to tell who is doing the best on the team so everyone can blame everyone and people don&amp;#39;t shut up when they are doing badly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anonymity.&lt;/em&gt; You will never see the players you&amp;#39;re playing with again. Thus their defaced, you don&amp;#39;t think of them as people really and can insult them all you like!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That all said, I really feel like the amount of trolling has gone down since the tribunal (that or I&amp;#39;ve just got really really thick skin now.) Anyways, hope that explains why league players are jackasses. It&amp;#39;s not that the players are more toxic, they&amp;#39;re just as toxic as those in any game, it&amp;#39;s just that the game actively makes things difficult.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I think a woman touching a guy's butt/chest is as inappropriate as it'd be vice versa. CMV.,"Just imagine the following situation,  a woman approaches some guy, touches his butt and says something flirty. Now imagine this guy saying something like why the hell did you touch my butt, that's inappropriate.. All of his friends would relate to him as a pussy or whatsoever, but I don't think my statement isn't just to related to social acceptance.  I think that if you'd sue the woman for sexual harrassment you wouldn't stand a chance, everything would think you just should man up, knowone would help/support you, not the cops, neither the judge.  If some guy would touch a woman's butt/chest he'd be related as a pervert, whereas the woman would be a independent, flirty woman...  I don't get it CMV","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mean, it&amp;#39;s changing considerably but I know what you mean, or at least how your perceiving it. This is why I think it occurs:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men&amp;#39;s chests aren&amp;#39;t deemed to be sexual areas, that&amp;#39;s why you guys can walk around with your tops off everywhere and it not be &amp;#39;obscene&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;public nudity&amp;#39; whereas women walking around with no clothes on top would be. You make the point below that it&amp;#39;s your choice where your want to be touched, yes - but society has deemed things that are ok, are sometimes ok and are not ok in public/without consent. So I can tap your shoulder from behind to get your attention, I can probably touch your elbow while flirting, I can&amp;#39;t really grab your junk without enthusiastic consent. If your lines are different from society&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s something you have to deal with, not society. The west has deemed men&amp;#39;s chests as relatively non-sexual, so you can&amp;#39;t expect people to act like your chest is different. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation. Obviously there will be exceptions to this - but in general women tend to touch men when they are flirting, whereas there&amp;#39;s a pretty strong trend for men to just grab at women. There has not been a single club night in which me and my friends have not been grabbed, and often we can&amp;#39;t even work out who did it. Ditto with whenever I&amp;#39;ve been/known a waitress. Whereas whenever I&amp;#39;ve seen women grab guys asses it tends to be after at least a little flirting, which would not necessarily make it entirely ok, but more a misunderstanding of how far the flirtation has gone rather than just a random, no warning, grabbing. I also haven&amp;#39;t had male friends get randomly grabbed, only ever during flirtation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;perception of power. There is no denying that average guy is stronger than average girl and that throughout history the power has been on the mans side and that even today men are considered the aggressors. This perhaps shouldn&amp;#39;t be the case, and i think we are reaching a place where we realise everyone can be sexually harassed, everyone can be the aggressors. But in the past this hasn&amp;#39;t been the case and we always take a while to shake off these double standards. So currently a girl grabbing a guy is seen as fun and flirty, and when he doesn&amp;#39;t want it &amp;#39;oops hahahah&amp;#39; whereas when guys grab a girl when she doesn&amp;#39;t want there&amp;#39;s an inherent perception of danger (if he&amp;#39;s willing to do that when I didn&amp;#39;t want it what else is he willing to do?) and in a world of averages the girl is in a situation where the guy fully has the ability to attack her/rape her with her having very little means to defend herself. Whereas (again, world of averages) the guy can usually pretty easily push a girl away if and when she goes too far. But, like I said, I think this is changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;as for the guys then calling each other pussies, this is the double standard of genders and sex. In general women are considered sluts if they sleep around a lot, so will aim to look like they&amp;#39;re not sluts, possibly by &amp;#39;overreacting&amp;#39; to being touched by a guy when they didn&amp;#39;t want to be (although some reaction is warranted of course) whereas men are all supposed to be super macho masculine guys and getting all the girls, so seeming to turn one down looks unmasculine. Obviously this double standard hurts both parties in terms of sexual harassment and grabbing, guys are told they should love it when it happens and do it to be a man, girls then get subjected to it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure you can show that people don&amp;#39;t take it seriously. I think men are less likely to report it as it&amp;#39;s seen to be weak, but I think once reported it would be treated the same, although I don&amp;#39;t have any stats, do you? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to start with the following disclosure: all people deserve to have their desire for personal space respected. All unwanted touches are inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/Nietzsches-Mustache""&gt;/u/Nietzsches-Mustache&lt;/a&gt; has done a great job of explaining the psychological aspect of a man touching a woman, but let&amp;#39;s talk a little bit about the social aspects of the male and female body.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Man chest vs. Female Chest -- Generally speaking people in Western countries are taught that female breasts are &amp;quot;private areas&amp;quot; part of the sexual organs that shouldn&amp;#39;t be displayed or touched in a public setting. That status elevates them to &amp;quot;no touchy&amp;quot; under most circumstances. Men however can walk topless without fear of being told they are being &amp;quot;brazen&amp;quot; or...oh fuck...what&amp;#39;s the word...idk...exhibitionist isn&amp;#39;t right but it gives the idea. Inappropriate, whatever. So man breast isn&amp;#39;t a taboo area of conversation, people wouldn&amp;#39;t be like to perceive it as a sexually aggressive move for a woman to touch a man&amp;#39;s chest/man boob.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Woman Ass vs Man Ass -- this one&amp;#39;s a little harder to break down, however, I think most of the issue with this comes from the social perception of who is normally the sexual aggressor, i.e. the one who initiates flirting and/or sex. Men do. Therefore the action of a man touching a woman&amp;#39;s ass is &amp;quot;typical man behavior&amp;quot; society has strict rules about this, and it is therefore accepted. A woman touching a man&amp;#39;s ass is...rarer and because of the typical perspective that men are the sexually aggressive gender any overt action by women is probably expected to be well received or at least tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think this speaks to the reason why lawsuits are easier to win from the female perspective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"I am sexist, CMV.","Physically, intellectually, and any other category of life I believe in general men are superior. I do recognize that there are very talented women in the world, some far better than men, but if you put the best man in a field against the best female in the same field I believe the male will dominate every time, no matter what the subject is. This seems to be true in academics, sports, and any other area in life. Even on a personal level I have found that girls are petty and silly, while men I have interacted with are far more interesting to have conversations with. I admit, I am very biased based on the fact that I have a male's perspective, but I have tried to be very open minded in talking to females but I find the majority of them dull and uninteresting. I think that the only successful girls in society are the ones that have natural ability (even then they don't get paid as much as men) or they use their looks to slide through life. Yes, I expect hordes of angry feminists to down vote me into oblivion (my sexism showing) and I could avoid this if I reworded my statements, but instead I'm choosing to pull on the oh so fragile female emotional strings. Instead of down voting me, prove me wrong. EDIT: You have all made excellent points.

Because I can talk to women like we&amp;#39;re both people, whereas men try to talk to me like they think we&amp;#39;re going to sleep together. Girls are a lot more to be flighty and silly when talking to a guy than they are when talking to another girl. Likewise, men are less likely to be creepy dumbasses when talking to you because they aren&amp;#39;t hitting on you. Both genders are much better conversationalists when they&amp;#39;re talking to a person, not a potential date/mate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By the way, it sounds like a lot of people in this thread helped you change your view.

Something like 8% more suicides in Canada are men. Something like 60% of students enrolled in post-education are females, and apparently the average amount of income for men has declined dramatically since 2000 where it has risen like 25% for women or something like that (although, women, on average, still make less). These aren&amp;#39;t exact, but you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re right, than we are in for one hell of a ridiculous century with all of these women coming to power. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry, but I equate the sexism of today with the racism of 100 years ago. Men come up with reasons (based on personal experience) to be sexist towards women; whether it be that you got passed up for a promotion by a woman, because a woman wasn&amp;#39;t as interesting a conversationalist as you, because a woman beat you in a public competition of sorts. Then you go on to claim that all women are not as smart as men. Men do this and then forget about the over prevalent need to address social and cultural issues effecting women. Maybe this woman who you don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;find interesting&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t want her boyfriend to beat her if he sees her talking to you. This example is extreme, but a LOT, and I mean, a LOT, of woman have been in this EXACT situation time and time again. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Women who are not as socially adjusted as you, or women who you don&amp;#39;t find intellectually as engaging as you, are held down by social constraints and norms reinforced by viewpoints held by people like you. As soon as you simply except that 1. you are wrong and 2. that you&amp;#39;re view point has absolutely no logic and no empirical evidence supporting it, not only will your life improve but the lives of billions of women will improve ever so slightly because one man came to except the reality of the situation instead of living under a blanket of fear. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 2013 dude.

"Alcohol is bad, please don't let me grow up boring","I'm 16 years old, and throughout my childhood my parents have been kind of pretty overprotective, not too much but eventually it resulted in me being fearful of smoking, any drugs, and alcohol.  The two former I don't mind, I wouldn't by far like to be interested in smoking and/or doing drugs, but the latter is kind of worrying me - alcohol is pretty damn normal in society, and I can't grow up sipping cola always and everywhere.  I'm afraid that alcohol will make drunk and eventually lose control of what I'm doing, and doing some extremely stupid stuff that I'll regret for ages. Also I'm afraid of any possible brain-damage.  Someone please convince me that alcohol isn't bad. :\  FYI; Alcohol at 16 is legal in my country.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your 16 now wait till your 32 and you have spent another lifetime of what you know now of always being in control. You might find that letting just a bit of that control go is a refreshing change. I am not saying go get hammered and drive home. If you want to try alcohol and you can do so legal then do it, but do it responsibly. Be with friends you trust who will keep you from doing anything too crazy when you drink. You will have to find your limit for what is too much and once you find it then don&amp;#39;t go overboard with it. Also don&amp;#39;t make assumptions about the drinking crowd, you say don&amp;#39;t let you grow up boring? Be in a group of people that are completely drunk off there asses some times with some people that can be more boring that hanging out with sober people. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You can be sober and interesting and drunk and boring. Don&amp;#39;t treat Alcohol as something that will suddenly make you not boring. Don&amp;#39;t fall into the peer pressure trap of do this like all the &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; kids. If you don&amp;#39;t want to grow up boring then take alcohol out of it completely. Read some books, find out about lots of topics, live your life, have experiences, find your opinion on things and talk about it with others and maybe change some of them over time. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My point is that Alcohol isn&amp;#39;t bad, and it isn&amp;#39;t good either. For me it&amp;#39;s a nice occasional break from the normal day which I can have a few drinks with friends and be silly but not out of control for a while. It is also a nice warm end to a good day with a bit of aged single malt scotch that I can enjoy the aroma of as I breath it in and sip on it slowly to just have a nice warm relaxed feeling to end the day on. Most of the good scotch is aged 16 years in an oak barrel. How many other things could you try out that were prepared by someone before you were born and were tended to for the duration of your life just so you could pour it into a glass and try it out to see if you liked the taste? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout high school and university I felt that alcohol would be too distracting/expensive and essentially didn&amp;#39;t drink at all until I was 25, except in rare situations such as vacations with family (we went to an all-inclusive resort in Costa Rica once during my university years where I let loose).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I might have had a better time if I wasn&amp;#39;t so puritan about how I viewed alcohol I definitely don&amp;#39;t regret not drinking. Alcohol is fun, but so are salsa dancing and snowboarding. There&amp;#39;s no reason to feel like you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; partake in a particular activity to lead a fulfilling life. There&amp;#39;s also absolutely nothing weird about hanging out with drunk people while sober.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That said, if you plan on heavy drinking make sure you have a plan on how to get home. There are some potential bad rookie mistakes you can make when drinking (dehydration, going too hard too early) but so long as you have a plan to stay safe you&amp;#39;ll be ok. Don&amp;#39;t be worried about being silly and stupid, that&amp;#39;s part of the fun! You&amp;#39;d actually be surprised how lucid you are while drunk, you mostly just lose motor control and inhibitions, not cognition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: Am I a hypocrite for watching Fifty Shades?,"I openly admit to reading the book Fifty Shades of Grey. Of course this is the internet and I have used a semi-private username, so it is easier for me to say this. The reason why I’m not completely open about reading the book made me reflect on the reasons for why I am ashamed about reading this book   The reason for this is that Fifty Shades of Grey is more than just about sex. It’s about relationship violence, manipulation, and the sexual objectification of women. The book is a source of romantic fantasy for women, but the key word is “unrealistic” fantasy. If you are familiar with the story, you know that Anastasia, the main character, and Christian Grey fall in love and she is the one to “change him.” It’s almost a sexual and abusive version of Beauty and the Beast, one of my favorite Disney movies. My concern is that women read Fifty Shades of Grey and get nothing but negative messages from it. These messages tell them that they can change an abusive relationship, they are to appeal to the man’s eye, and that it is okay to objectify your body for the sexual pleasure of men. I want more opinions about this, because to me I am a hypocrite for buying the book.  Edit: The hypocrisy here also comes from endorsing the series through buying the book and/or movie ticket.  Conclusion: I am not a hypocrite for buying and reading the book while disagreeing with the content. I think it’s important for me to express how I feel about the book, but in the end Fifty Shades of Grey was meant for entertainment. I didn’t enjoy the BDSM theme of the book and can’t relate to that sort of “pleasure,” therefore I am already bias to the book and I can’t understand this appeal. I think the fact that the actions were consensual in the book don’t an abusive relationship because it was about submissives, so the characters are not “encouraging” this type of relationship for everyone. It was my choice to read the book, and now it’s my choice to give my own review. I may feel it has a negative influence, but I never said “I would never buy that book” for these reasons, therefore I am not a hypocrite. I still think this type of imagery for couples, of any sexuality, is not healthy. Abuse and unequal power between men and women isn't an issue that should even be danced around. It's something to take seriously. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I&amp;#39;m legitimately curious, as I&amp;#39;ve never read the book, and know very little about it outside the BDSM theme.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;that it is okay to objectify your body for the sexual pleasure of men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is?

"Despite our love of 'freedom', i don't believe US citizens possess or exercise any rights or liberties not present in other similarly developed first world countries (britain, germany, etc.). CMV",,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gun rights are an obvious counter-example. Some will argue that guns shouldn&amp;#39;t be a right I guess, but it&amp;#39;s very difficult to argue that self defense is not a natural right and Americans undeniably have a greater ability to defend themselves than those in many other countries do and many choose to exercise that ability to the extent that they are able.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US is often much more lax in regards to speech rights than countries in the EU. Germany for example has made a lot of speech relating to Nazis and the holocaust illegal and also has very strict censoring laws for video game violence. Most EU members don&amp;#39;t allow any kind of hate speech, while the US only bans speech that poses an imminent danger. The KKK can hold a rally in support of white supremacy for example as long as they do not start making plans to head to a minority&amp;#39;s home and burn it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to gun laws and free speech, the US also have greater protections for the accused.

Once you request your council no one can so much as talk to you. Yes other countries have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of these in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; cases, but they are not universal rights. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We also have greater economic freedom than most other countries. We have lower barriers to entry, fewer regulations to start a business, and lower tariffs and taxes.

"I believe that just because someone ""Can't do better"" does not disallow their right to criticize. CMV","Allow me to explain.  In the past, I have witnessed online, and experienced myself, criticism against an unpopular opinion, specifically, on the topic of overrated contestants on the X-factor. [There was one contestant that stood out in a terrible performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrHcbrRSxTc), but I’ll give that she was underdeveloped in every respect, mentally and maturity-wise. I expressed my dislike for her performance, as one does, in the youtube comment section. Personally, I find that her voice is similar to a bleating lamb, and she is not fully capable with the enunciation of all lyrics. Consequently, I received many replies, with an outright majority of replies in which the essence of the message was that “If you can’t do better, you shouldn’t criticise”. However, I stand by the view that I have the right to justified criticism whether I am able to do better myself, or worse. Change my view!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, with regards to art - ability to criticize it is almost the entire purpose of art.  Personal interpretation and preference are integral to the art viewing/listening experience and anyone who thinks you should not be able to express a differing opinion is simply being silly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, people who truly believe they are &amp;#39;right&amp;#39; about art, and express their views in such a fashion are likewise being silly.  So depending on what you mean by &amp;#39;justified criticism&amp;#39; and whether that includes statements that claim a particular performer is factually terrible or irredeemable is probably beyond your critical ability.  It is indeed possible that someone with years of experience in that art form, whether it be an artist, a teacher, or a professional critic, would have a better understanding of an artist&amp;#39;s potential and thus be more justified in their criticism than you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To get a clearer view of the problem uninformed criticism can bring we can look outside of art in a more objective setting.  Let&amp;#39;s compare it to people criticizing scientific studies that they haven&amp;#39;t really read (much less understood).  An uninformed critic only makes the conversation wander from the important facts and constantly brings up arguments that are already addressed clearly in scientific literature.  I could see a music critic taking a similar view about uninformed music listeners claiming this or that artist is the worst ever when the topic could be about how that particular artist is pushing this or that musical boundary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right. This answer may be a tad complex and I&amp;#39;m unsure if I can express it well, but bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In practice, whenever you make a statement about something, in reality you say two separate things. Firstly, you say that the thing you are saying is believed to be true; if you say &amp;quot;on my left is a dog&amp;quot; you indicate that you believe that there is a dog on your left. The same goes for subjective statements; &amp;quot;that dog is annoying&amp;quot; indicates that you believe that that dog is annoying. Hopefully, this is all self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But from a sociological perspective, you also make a second statement; &amp;quot;not only do I believe that there is a dog on my left, &lt;em&gt;but I believe that this is worth saying&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. Upon reflection, this makes perfect sense; why would you say something that you didn&amp;#39;t think was worth saying? But this highlights that when you say something, you are not just an impartial dictator of truth; you are reflecting your beliefs &lt;em&gt;and claiming that you believe they are worth stating&lt;/em&gt;. Calling someone fat doesn&amp;#39;t just say &amp;quot;I think you&amp;#39;re fat&amp;quot;; it also, depending on context of course, can also say &amp;quot;I think you&amp;#39;re fat, and I am okay with saying that fact out loud in order to belittle you and therefore use your weakness to on some level establish social superiority&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You may be able to see where I&amp;#39;m taking this. When you say &amp;quot;X is shitty at singing&amp;quot;, the thing that people may take issue with &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; that first function. They aren&amp;#39;t saying that you aren&amp;#39;t allowed to have an opinion on the matter. &lt;strong&gt;What they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; taking issue with is that second function; the fact that, in some contexts, criticism can amount to not only an impartial expression of opinion but as a sociological wedge to gain a social advantage.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s not about your &amp;quot;right to criticise&amp;quot;, which is obviously key to freedom of thought and information; it&amp;#39;s about curtailing abuse of that right where it is used to unjustly gain a social edge. You write &amp;quot;God, that person is terrible at singing&amp;quot;; they interpret it, and perhaps legitimately in some contexts, as &amp;quot;He thinks that person is terrible at singing, and the fact that he said it indicates that he&amp;#39;s trying to use that person as a way of looking superior; after all, why else would he bother?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying that your Youtube comment, as a matter of fact, was an example of this. &lt;strong&gt;What I&amp;#39;m saying is that sometimes criticism can be a means of declaring, on some subtle level, superiority, and in those contexts, it is perfectly legitimate for people to sense this, and bring you back down to earth by reference to the fact that you yourself could&amp;#39;t match that level of performance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt; - Thanks for the deltas and the &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1uh8tt/utomf1sh_explains_how_criticism_has_two_meanings/""&gt;shoutout in /r/bestof/&lt;/a&gt;!!!

I don't think low voter turnout is a problem. CMV.,"People often say it is a major problem if not many people vote, and people try to encourage everyone to vote.   I think that if I don't know much about the issues or candidates in a referendum/election etc, there is no reason for me to vote. The vote would end up as either a nearly random guess or just the same as how people I know voted. The more people vote, the more it waters down the effect of people with a strong opinion or people with a lot of knowledge about the issues.  I guess it's better if more people get informed and vote, but many/most don't want to or can't spend the time and effort to do this, so should just not vote.  The counterargument is often that this would allow radical extreme candidates to get power. Well, if they're very obviously evil/idiotic, people would vote. Also, how would the evil candidate fool the few well-informed voters?  Change my view!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main problem is a lack of correlation. Yes, if uninformed people didn&amp;#39;t vote, then nothing is really harmed by that. But the problem is that many informed people don&amp;#39;t vote, and many uninformed people do because someone told them they should vote for X. (This is often &amp;quot;their pastor&amp;quot;, but there are obviously other sources of influence that are not sources of actual information.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dismissing everybody who doesn&amp;#39;t vote as uninformed is a false generalisation. Another reason people might decline to vote is the belief that their vote doesn&amp;#39;t matter and won&amp;#39;t influence the outcome. The people who are voting aren&amp;#39;t universally informed either as it&amp;#39;s not uncommon for people to loyally vote for their candidate/party regardless of (changes in their) position.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, the most important factor in determining whether or not people vote is whether there are candidates/parties running which are worthy of your vote. Voting for the lesser evil has you voting for an evil nonetheless. A large percentage of the eligible populations neglecting to vote should be treated as a systemic problem which requires to be solved. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: the human race is currently at it's greatest and evidence shows that the future will be overwhelmingly positive,"Many posts in this subreddit are overwhelmingly negative. What do you think of this idea? Economically, culturally, physically, we are at our peak as a species. I've personally experienced evidence of this in some of the poorest and richest places in the world.  Economically, every measure of activity and growth has consistently increased and is now at (or near) the best numbers we've recorded. Moore's Law still hasn't slowed down. Every minute new innovations are occurring somewhere around the world. Our governing and economic systems have been refined to the point where violence is no longer necessary to create change.   Culturally, we're more connected than ever. Via the internet, extremely cheap methods of travel, and extremely cheap methods of production, we are in a continuous Renaissance culturally. Everyone can be everywhere (virtually within seconds, physically within hours) and create almost anything (hardware, music, etc.) for anyone.  Physically, our version of natural selection over the years (killing the weak, rule by the strong) has led us to extremely fit genetics and war is no longer necessary. Nature has done us a huge favor and we only need to nurture ourselves to be great. Just look at the olympics, or any sport for that matter. Even warfare has become more humane.

Diverse species are perhaps the most amazing fruit of the earth, but when they are lost, they are irretrievable - even with scientific achievements like trying to revive wooly mammoths, the vast majority of extinctions are permanent loss of biodiversity on our planet. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are a host of environmental issues to consider: deforestation, waterway pollution, ocean gyres, vast overfishing, and climate change. I personally focus on loss of biodiversity. I believe that any of these problems becomes catastrophic once it leads or contributes to the permanent loss of species. Indeed, while anthropogenic climate change is a serious issue for human beings, thousands upon thousands of species far less equipped to deal with change than us will (and may already) be negatively affected.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By all accounts, it isn&amp;#39;t possible to know what we are losing, because we scarcely even know whats out there. Here are some facts from the &lt;a href=""http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/biodiversity/biodiversity/""&gt;World Wildlife Fund&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The rapid loss of species we are seeing today is estimated by experts to be between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;These experts calculate that between 0.01 and 0.1% of all species will become extinct each year.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If the low estimate of the number of species out there is true - i.e. that there are around 2 million different species on our planet** -  then that means between 200 and 2,000 extinctions occur every year.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;But if the upper estimate of species numbers is true - that there are 100 million different species co-existing with us on our planet - then between 10,000 and 100,000 species are becoming extinct each year.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have a dilemma; I want to maintain your rosy perspective on human achievement and potential, but I do want to change your view that the future is overwhelmingly positive without &lt;em&gt;lots and lots of work&lt;/em&gt;. Work that very well may not happen, leaving us with a less hospitable, and irrecoverably less diverse natural world. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A very scary part of all this is that the incredible economy you talked about, often fueled by exploitation and war, is the driver of a huge amount of the activity which creates so many of these problems. But the social side of environmental issues is a whole other can of worms, one that touches on the fact that the vast majority of humanity is not achieving any version of the comfort and security of the most developed nations, and that the global cultural paradigm is not set up for an &amp;#39;everyone wins&amp;#39; system - exploitation is, at a very deep level, built in. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is no evidence that this is in any way driving us towards an enlightened social future in regard to economic justice for most people around the world. Not that there aren&amp;#39;t social movements that are exciting, but money and power have a bit of a vice grip on society, and the pyramid scheme has worked out well for those few at the top for a long time. A bigger room at the top of the pyramid is not, in my book, human progress, especially when it is contingent on little paid or unpaid labor at the bottom. Oof, sorry for the social rant. Back to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you want just one small but detailed slice of the biodiversity issue, check out the documentary &amp;#39;The End of the Line&amp;#39; about overfishing in our oceans. It touches on how in such a &amp;quot;great&amp;quot; human civilization may manage to completely devastate our oceans for generations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: There isn&amp;#39;t much greatness in one species affecting a mass extinction of the scale we are currently seeing. It is so bad, that the current era is being labeled the &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropocene""&gt;&amp;#39;Anthropocene&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt;, and is largely characterized by drastic loss in biodiversity - which without us would have increased exponentially. It is hypothesized that we have created the sixth mass extinction of planet earth, and despite international efforts it is only getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;edit: added TLDR.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;edit 2: formatting!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 things.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) Global Warming. It is the most important issue of our time, and even relatively optimistic models show us blowing past the 2 degree mark that singals the comtinuation of a relatively stable climate. And yet, people and nations are not talking much about it or doomg much about it. At the best, Germany has made great strides in introducing much remewable power into their country lately. However, they have also taken a huge step backwards by ending all nuclear programs, becoming more relient on fossil fuels for intermittant power. Meanwhile, developing nations are spewing out greenhouse gasses s their industries and standard of living rise, and the wealthiest nation on earth can&amp;#39;t even convince half its population that global warming is happening. I believe we will make it through this, but at the expense of a large amount of our standard of living, a great deal of the beautiful ecology of this planet, and the lives of the world&amp;#39;s poorest.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) The information age has led to a great amount of connection, yes. And computers are becoming more complex and powerful by the day. However, the most advanced programs are not owned in a common space by all people, but are owned by private corporations, who will use them for profit. As the internet of things grows, you will be endlessly tracked so that the most persuasive advertisements can be made to entice you to part with your money, so that you are forced into a system of drudgery, slavong away at your job, only to be fleeced once again by an advertizing campaign so nuanced that you won&amp;#39;t even realize it is happening. As the number of jobs done by machines (owned by the companies) increases, the population of earth divides in two: the unemployed, and the owners of the companies. And as the machines become ever more knowledgable and complex, they dissapear from the public eye into the eather, becoming alongside their owners, gods. Ruling over the peasents of earth. All hail Ronald McDonald, hallowed be his name.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) As we develop new technology, the potential for an individual to be great increases. If you want to learn or do something, it is easier than ever. However, the fastest advancements come in the form of mindless distractions. It is now easier than ever to not focus on the world around you. We are given access to an ever increasing amount of drivel games, meme jokes, porn, and novel drugs. As technology develops, we will eventually develop virtual reality, where the illusion is so compelling, amusing, enjoyable, and ever so slightly challenging, that we never want to leave. Meanwhile, while we are so distracted, our world falls to shit as voter participation drops to zero.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
I believe we should leave the poor parts of Africa to their own devices. CMV,"I honestly think the white man should stop playing the saviour and just leave Africa alone, let nature take its course.

"I think property tax should be attached to the owner and not the property, CMV","Often when homes are foreclosed on or go up for auction for whatever reason, the new owner is responsible for any back taxes  owed or liens on the property.  I think this is wrong because it is a disincentive to buy the house if you have to pay thousands in *somebody else's* taxes right off the bat.  Many homes just sit and sit because they aren't worth buying due to back taxes.  Also it varies by municipality, but it can be difficult to accurately find out whether or not a home actually has back taxes or not.  So you blindly have to put in a bid and hope that there aren't back taxes  owed on it.  This only opens the game up to people in the industry and it's an unfair advantage in my opinion.  Basically I think if you live somewhere for however many years without paying taxes, the taxes should follow *you*, not the property.  **EDIT:** I'm trying to discern what makes property taxes special compared to other taxes.  If I owe $20,000 to the IRS because I haven't paid income taxes in years, the person who takes my job after I left doesn't suddenly become responsible for that.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California title will not transfer to the new owners without the taxes paid first. If the buyer is paying it is  because the seller doesnt have the cash / money. It makes no difference who pays (buyer, seller) since it will adjust any proceeds to the seller in the escrow process. When purchasing foreclosed property the current owner / bank pays the tax. Taxes are tied to the property since 5 years of default can cause the county to foreclose on you, but if you cant pay your taxes you shouldnt get the benefits ( police, firemen, streets, schools, etc). Putting a lean on the property means the county gets paid even if the seller wont/cant.  Tax rolls are not rocket science and are public information, so there shouldnt be a surprise to any new owners.  Also title insurance covers the new owner for any undiscovered leans not shown in the title report.   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OP: What state are you in?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the buyer knows about the lien then it shouldn&amp;#39;t make much difference.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m willing to pay $100,000 for the property and there&amp;#39;s a $10,000 lien on it then I pay $90,000 to the current owner and $10,000 to pay off the lien.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If I&amp;#39;m willing to pay $100,000 and the owner has a personal debt of $10,000 then I give him $100,000 and he pays off the $10,000. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Either way, it costs me just as much and the money ends up in the same place.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit: and don&amp;#39;t buy real estate without title insurance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"CMV:The fact that rich people can afford better/more lawyers than poor people is a fundamental miscarriage of justice. In order to combat this problem, each side in a legal battle should be forced to contribute equal money to their own counsel and their opponents counsel.","There are two parts to this view, and I will award deltas if you can change either of them. The first is that money in courts is a fundamental miscarriage of justice. When I see cases where a drunk kid kills people, but their rich parents get them off with their crack team of lawyers, or a powerful corporation destroys a regular person or small business with a costly court case on extremely weak grounds because the small business can't afford to fight back, I am sickened. Equality in the eyes of the law is in my opinion the single most important part of our society, and in the current system, the rich and the poor are not equal in the eyes of the law.  The second part of my view is that a good solution to this problem is to require that both sides in a lawsuit or court case contribute equally to their own legal team and their opponents. I've thought long and hard about this, and this is the best thing I can come up with. Other attempts to bring equality to courts that I've seen all fall short somewhere. The loser paying the winner's legal fees doesn't help, because it only takes place after the end of the lawsuit, and large corporations win by dragging on a suit until the small business runs out of money and has to give up. Preventing money from entering the courts in the first place doesn't work, because some issues actually are complex and nuanced and require lots of lawyer's time to analyse. Having each party contribute equally to their own and their opponents legal fees ensures that complex cases can be sorted out as long as one party is willing to pay for it, it ensures that both sides are equal in the eyes of the law, and it solves the problems I brought up earlier. In the case of he rich parents paying to get their drunk-driving son off easy, they would be forced to contribute an equal amount to the state's case, allowing the state to effectively fight back, and it prevents large corporations bleeding small entities dry, because the small entities aren't using their own money anymore.  Essentially, the legal system has in some cases been turned into a weapon, and this proposal would turn it back into what it should be: a way to determine wrongdoing.  One note: Don't try to change my view that this can't be done because it is a restriction on freedom without first trying to convince me that freedom is more important than equality. I believe that equality is more important than freedom and I'm totally willing reduce freedom in exchange for an increase in equality, within reason.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The problem is not a lack of resources on the prosecuting side, it is a lack of resources for regular people who are accused of drunk driving.  The better solution to that problem is to provide more funding for public defenders, not to give more money to prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Giving money to prosecutors wouldn&amp;#39;t even really make sense, since prosecutors aren&amp;#39;t paid on a case-by-case basis.

CMV: The gambling age should be 16. (U.S.A.),"I find it ridiculous one must be 18 to simply buy a scratch ticket. For one, buying a scratch ticket will not directly cause one physical harm.

Also, many argue that since gambling is addictive, only adults should be able to gamble. While I agree that gambling is addictive, not everybody who gambling becomes an addict.

Yeah, we have a gambling problem. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I know people personally who put their entire paycheck through the pokies time after time, having to rely on family for rent and food. This is an addiction, a very powerful one, and usually goes hand in hand with poor math and reasoning skills. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If it were up to me there would be no profit whatsoever to establishments which have pokies and instead they would have to offer table games like poker or blackjack. The lack of interaction with a person in order to gamble away one&amp;#39;s wages is in my mind a key problem with the current system. There is no incentive to help gamblers stop and spend their money in real economic gains such as items, rent, food, or savings. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average problem gambler loses $12,000 each year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is evil, and is akin to usury.

The answer is the gaming operators (Pubs, Clubs, Casinos) and the biggest winner of them all is the government who collect billions every year as gambling taxes - a much bigger prize.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So you see, it is something that the state governments profit off, the establishments profit off, and the users lose on. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Taking someone who has low impulse control as all of us do until about 25 and putting them in front of a machine or other system in which all the reward centres of their brain are triggered to make them strive for a win is a stupid idea. I would rather they raised the minimum age for alcohol and gambling to 25, weed to 18, and develop a lighter drug for those 15 and up, something clean which does not leave you messy, interfere with inhibition and does not damage the brain. I think the government should actually invest in developing these drugs to make safer versions of them, reducing medical costs in the future and increasing future revenue from taxes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would also be better to desensitize teens to gamble by giving them this right when they do not have to worry about bills, college tuition, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You think it is better to allow people to learn to gamble when they do not have the money to do so, and therefore any money spent on gambling would probably be more impactful?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The risk with gambling is that someone is not mature enough to realize that they have a problem or that gambling is damaging their lives. Obviously people can be over 18 and still not realize this, but there needs to be an arbitrary age for consent somewhere, and that age is 18.

"CMV: I believe that birth control is not a ""basic human right.""","I believe that birth control, while generally a quality of life improvement, is not a ""basic human right"" as many people would argue. The largest argument I have heard is one of women's rights, in that women should have control over their own reproductive choices, and birth control is a means to that end. I believe that the basic human right associated with reproductive choice is the right to refuse sexual intercourse. People are entirely free to not have children, and that freedom should be protected as a human right. However, I don't believe that people are entitled to having sex without consequences. There are many things in this world that are quality of life improvements, but that doesn't necesitate that they be provided free of charge and considered fundamental to decent human existance. As an aside, I understand that birth control pills are often prescribed as a treatment for certain conditions. I would consider that as medicine and a basic human right.

One of the sexes can have a child and one cannot and regardless of the father&amp;#39;s role in the life of the child, the woman is the one ultimately responsible for the well-being of the fetus and, perhaps solely, the child once it arrives.  Providing women with universal birth control for a medical condition or for the prevention of pregnancy is cost efficient and as a society lets the female know that she is valued, and that point, in my opinion, is congruent to what is a &amp;quot;basic human right.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I believe the topic would be moot if an oral contraceptive was available to men.

"Claiming that the dichotomy ""women can act like men, but men can't act like women"" results from the logic ""feminine = weak"" prevents needed discussions of masculinity by drawing the focus back to women. CMV.","It is a common observation that women can act and dress like men (more or less) without reproach, but that men cannot act and dress like women without criticism.   For instance: a woman who wears a suit, works a full time job, and knows how to fix cars is perhaps not a typical woman, but is not harshly judged. Conversely, a man who wears a dress, stays home to take care of children, and likes to arrange flowers is ridiculed and even harassed.   A common (usually feminist, but not always -- it's tough to generalize feminism) response used to explain or justify this observation is that ""femininity is viewed as weak, whereas masculinity is viewed as strong; therefore, weak --&gt; strong === good but strong --&gt; weak === bad.""  I want to argue that this common response prevents needed discussions of masculinity by drawing the focus back to femininity and women.   That is, we tend to respond to such situations by asking, as we ask in many other places, ""What's wrong with how we view women?"" Very rarely do we ask, on a large scale basis, ""Why is masculinity so restrictive? What can we do to help young boys feel more comfortable if they don't measure up to traditional 'masculine' standards?""  I believe that men are more confined than women by gender roles, and that if we continually approach that fact by attempting to change ""femininity"" and not ""masculinity,"" we will fail to facilitate change.  EDIT: I should note that by ""acts like a man"" (etc.) I of course mean ""the traditional man""; NOT that ""all men do or act this way.""  **EDIT II: VERY IMPORTANT**  I've awarded a delta to /u/GnosticGnome not for necessarily changing my view but for shifting the scope of my argument (I've added emphases):   &gt; I think the issue I have with your argument is that ""men can't act like women"" actually is to a large extent a simple subset of ""men can't be weak"". Men are permitted to wear their hair long. They are allowed to arrange flowers. They are allowed to carry water. They are allowed to cook. They are encouraged to take good care of children provided they also have a job. They are allowed to clean. These are all ""feminine"" things that men are encouraged to do **if they happen to be good at it.**  &gt; Men are not allowed to be weak. They are not allowed to wear stupid clothing, and it so happens that most stupid clothing is female or disappears from existence because who else would buy it. They are not allowed to be unemployed, even if they have kids.

But the domains of strength that might be called feminine (good with kids, clean, cooking, design, etc) are totally allowed for men just as any domain of strength is.** I don't mean to take this to an extreme, but I think it's more true that weakness is unacceptable for men than that feminine strength is unacceptable for men.

CMV: I believe that downvotes are about as useful as upvotes and should generally not be discouraged (for the most part).,"I believe that the sorting of comments is improved when people downvote almost as frequently as they upvote.  We are all familiar with the phenomenon of late posts getting buried and early posts remaining at the top of the thread.  This phenomenon is the direct result of the fact that most people only read the first few comments in a thread combined with the fact that people tend to upvote significantly more than they downvote.  Let me use a hypothetical example to explain my point.  Imagine there is a 5 hour old thread with 100 comments in it and the top five comments are all mediocre comments that 50% of people who read them upvote.  Then someone posts an extremely high quality comment that over 90% of people who read it upvote.  This comment starts with 1 upvote so it is at position 70 or so out of the 100 comments.  So after a couple hours 1000 people view the comments, 100% of them view the first five comments and only about 2% of them view the 70th comment.  So the top five mediocre comments would get upvotes from 50% of the 1000 people (500 upvotes) and the amazing post at position 70 would get upvotes form 90% of the people who read it (18 upvotes).  I hope this illustrates how, in a world where people only use upvotes and not downvotes, top posts will tend to remain at the top even if they are only moderately good comments while great comments that are posted late will tend to remain near the middle or bottom (unless they are linked to by /r/bestof or something).  I think we can all agree that it is more desirable to have comments sorted by perceived quality than by some other arbitrary method (how early you posted).  If instead of only using upvotes, people used downvotes just as frequently, this problem is greatly improved.  In the same example as before let’s assume that everyone votes, up or down, on every post they read.  So instead of just not upvoting the posts that they feel don’t deserve an upvote, they downvote it.  In this situation, 50% of people would upvote the top five posts and 50% of people would downvote them, so even though only 2% of people actually go down the list to read the high quality 70th post, its upvote count will still rise faster than the top five mediocre posts.  I believe that in a subreddit such as /r/CMV you should not downvote opinions just because you disagree with them, but I also think that you shouldn’t upvote comments just because you agree with them for the same reason.  You should upvote comments that you feel are of high quality and downvote comments you feel are of low quality.  We want the comments to be sorted from best to worst so that when someone visits a thread they will be confronted with the most compelling arguments first.  So that is why I think it is misguided for the mods of /r/CMV to encourage people to not downvote posts *in general*.  I totally support them asking people to not vote just based on whether they agree or disagree with someone, but I think people should vote both up and down based on how compelling they feel the argument is.  I’m going to preempt a few concerns here:  1) Downvoting discourages people from voicing unpopular opinions.  First off, I don’t think you should downvote an opinion for being unpopular, but only if you think it is a bad argument (i.e. it is a logical fallacy or it makes some assertions that are objectively wrong, like if they claimed that we shouldn’t invade Iran because it’s in South America).  Secondly, I think it’s more important to sort comments properly than to worry about people’s feelings getting hurt from negative karma.  I think if you are avoiding posting things because you are worried about a negative karma score, that is pretty ridiculous.   2) Even if most people think a comment is low quality, that doesn’t mean everyone will think so.  By downvoting comments that the majority of people find low quality, you are making it less likely that someone who might find it compelling will see it.  You could make the same argument against sorting it by upvotes only.  “Just because the majority of people consider a post to be high quality doesn’t mean everyone will and by allowing the highest upvoted comments to rise to the top you are pushing the less popular posts to the bottom making them less likely to be seen by someone who isn’t convinced by the popular arguments.”  I think if you want to make this argument, you can’t just make it against downvotes, but against sorting by perceived quality in general.   3) If people downvote OP’s comments, he/she won’t get as many responses so it will be harder to change their view.  I agree 100% with this and you should never downvote OP’s comments in their own thread.  But if you aren’t the OP, then I think it is better to address the most compelling arguments.   4)  It is better to report arguments that break the rules than to downvote them.  I am not talking about comments that violate the rules.  I am talking about totally legitimate comments that address the topic with real questions and concerns.  But if there are a lot of really great comments, they should be sorted in a logical way with the best comments first and the worst comments last.  Yes, you should report any comments that violate the rules.  Other than that, you should upvote comments you find especially good and downvote comments you find especially bad.  Maybe there are two comments making the same point but one does so with referenced sources and the other does so without sources and in a confusing or arrogant way.  So upvote the better one and downvote the worse one even though neither of them needs to be reported.   **EDIT**:  I'd also like to add that I don't think there is really any value in downvoting people into the negatives unless they are trolling.  I can see how that would be disheartening to people trying to contribute while not really adding anything to the sorting.  I would suggest that people down't downvote comments that are made in good faith that are already at 0. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

But it won&amp;#39;t and changing all the visitors to Reddit to post with this philosophy in mind is going to be impossible. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Secondly, I think it’s more important to sort comments properly than to worry about people’s feelings getting hurt from negative karma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Again, you are talking about how people should conduct themselves, which seems pretty totalitarian to be honest. I don&amp;#39;t think we should go around waving fingers at people, but instead it should be more important to work the system in a way to manipulate how people naturally respond to things.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, if people are going generally Upvote = Good/Agree, down vote = Bad/Disagree, why wouldn&amp;#39;t it better to sort the comments by which comments are closer to 50/50. Which would put the most split comments at the top. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I also think the tree system in reddit is pretty bad, and when comments are open it would be better to only have the root comments appear. If the first comment is interesting then open up a further stem of the root comment voluntarily or move on to a different perspective which is more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Downvotes and dissident views are generally buried and discouraged on this sight which in general is bad. I think a better solution to this is track upvote/downvote separately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think reddit would be just fine if not better without downvotes. First of all, most comments that generally get a lot of downvotes are trolls. By eliminating downvotes these comments simply wouldn&amp;#39;t get upvoted, and then trolls wouldn&amp;#39;t get the attention that they desperately seek. This is the same for content that people don&amp;#39;t want to see/disagree with: if it simply didn&amp;#39;t get voted on as opposed to getting downvoted then we would have the same result, which is that good content gets upvoted and seen by more people, while bad content doesn&amp;#39;t get voted on and ultimately isn&amp;#39;t seen by many users (which is the general goal of the voting system as I understand it). There would still be an incentive to post good content because people would still collect karma for it, but people who purposely post bad content in an attempt to get downvotes (trolls) wouldn&amp;#39;t be seen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"I think GoT is badly-written, misogynistic tripe. CMV enough to get through reading the books.","I'm tired of all the bad writing, rape scenes, references to rape, gang rape, threats of rape, senseless nudity, high percentage of female characters who are prostitutes, sexual assault on any character but especially those who are minors, constant references to a non-gender-conformist character as ugly and homely, and above all, the defense of all of these tropes by otherwise reasonable people.  The thing that bothers me the most is GRRM's wasted potential. He had the opportunity to create a new world, one that is *not* ours and could have its own rules, and for some reason for the sake of 'realism' opted to set it in a pseudo-medieval setting. Though in my view there's not all that much wasted potential, because he is overly verbose, repetitive, and generally uses a number of stock characters with minor tweaks that are not that compelling. Example: Joffrey. We know he is evil. We do not need to hear about him sexually assaulting his (minor) fiancee.  Reading this is part of a deal. I listen to my spouse read and he in return is making something of his own according to a hobby I have that he has never shared. However, there is nothing reprehensible or triggering about this hobby, so I feel I have borne an unfair burden in this 'deal'. I tried to watch the show but because of both sexual and animal violence, refused to watch it again and have never looked back. Do NOT talk about the show, please, but rather try to communicate to me that there is *something* worthwhile in these books that will keep me sane as we plod through them.  **We are only about halfway into the second book, so please keep spoilers out. I'm not refusing to read them but want to do my research first about whether these are even worth continuing.  Perhaps this isn't quite in the spirit of the forum, but I'm not looking to be converted into a rabid GoT fan.

But plod I did, and I&amp;#39;m glad for it. I don&amp;#39;t think that you and I see at all eye-to-eye on the matter of what&amp;#39;s wrong with them (case in point: Martin does a good job at, as time goes on, making things a lot less clear-cut for calling character&amp;#39;s like Joffrey &amp;quot;evil&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, this is a book that is at the forefront of the zeitgeist, and immensely popular. Any genre fiction has too many superficial critics (as well as un-self-critical fans). We need people who can play the loyal opposition, who can read it and be able to articulate well why it is that those people don&amp;#39;t like it, or what they feel is wrong with it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not only do you get to read it &amp;#39;fresh,&amp;#39; in the sense of not having people prejudice your opinion, but, if you do detest it, you will be able to find all the reasons why, and explain them, which may cause some of the people who are fans to rethink, in whole or in part, their own understanding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;he is overly verbose&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t find him verbose at all. Quite the opposite. His descriptions of things are so bland and basic the whole thing would feel very much like &amp;quot;teen fic&amp;quot; were it not for all the x-rated stuff. If it were verbose then maybe we&amp;#39;d see some personality or creativity in the writing style.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the record: I think the TV show did a better job of housing the story than the books did.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not looking to be converted into a rabid GoT fan.

The Remains of the Day?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#39;d recommend stop trying to convert yourself to them and pick up something new.

CMV: I Don't Think I Should Bother Voting.,"Hello, fellow redditors! I'm Grim, and here's your chance to tell me why I'm an idiot and yadda yadda yadda. Here's the deal: I'm a 22 year old White Male living in the state of Indiana in the United States of America. My first presidential election was in 2008, and I voted for Obama. I'd already written off the Republicans as the slaves of corporate lobbyists, private interests, and Christian Fundamentalism, and I still believe there's not a single republican worth my support in any way, shape, or form. I was one of those idealistic, optimistic young voters who honestly believed in the power of Democracy. I bought Obama's (false)Hope hook, line, and sinker, and aside from that, I didn't see any alternatives to him that were even remotely palatable. Romney and Santorum were both about as Crazy fundy as presidential candidates got, and Gingrich had Wallstreet so far up his ass that putting him in office would've been, in my opinion, only slightly less worse of an idea than electing Adolf Hitler.  So here I was: One vote to cast, only one option that seemed viable. I put my faith, my trust, my hope in Obama, and he fucked me. He fucked all of us. Gitmo is still open. The wars in the Middle East are still on. In some states, homosexuals still have to be afraid of being true to themselves. The rich keep getting richer, and those of us below the poverty line just keep sinking deeper and deeper into the mud. In short, I realize now that voting for Obama was a waste of my time and energy, and a huge blow to my ability to trust the American Political System.  So what do I believe in? Well, I like to keep it simple: I believe in an end to the Drug War, because it's been a complete and utter failure and a waste of everyone's time, energy, and money. I believe in an end to our participation in the Middle East conflicts, because again, we have achieved nothing: One dead dictator, thousands of dead civilians, a ""secret"" prison full of accused terrorists, who if they weren't terrorists going in, I could hardly blame them for being terrorists if/when they get out. Our soldiers deserve causes worth fighting for: Not Imperial Conquest and certainly not a war that does nothing but line the pockets of the Military Industrial Complex.  I believe in reasonable restrictions on gun ownership, but never an outright ban on handguns, shotguns, rifles, etc. I believe that it's not the government's business, nor anyone elses', who you love and who you marry. I believe in the complete and utter separation of church and state. I believe that, if corporations and business aren't going to pay their employees a fair wage, then a minimum wage (That's a whole other CMV) must be set that is enough for people to get by on without having to resort to working three jobs. if McDonalds can triple the pay of their CEO to 13.8 million dollars, then I can call bullshit on a raise in the Minimum Wage destroying the economy!  I believe that education is a universal right for all humans, and it shouldn't be denied to someone just because they can't afford it. I believe that Climate Change being caused by humanity's rising consumption of fossil fuels, and I want to see the government take an active role in shifting us away from their use, while funding and supporting alternative energies. I believe in spending our budget responsibly, and working to make a better country in the long term, so that it's a country I'd actually want to start a family in.  I don't like either party. Neither of them are anywhere near my stance in politics, and I don't know where to begin looking for alternatives, if they even exist. I'm sick of watching the American People elect morons and greedy, self serving jack-nozzles, and I can't allow myself to be a part of that endless circlejerk anymore.  So here's the TL;DR: Given the disgustingly revolting state of the American Political Scene, should I even bother voting? If so, then provide me with some pointers for where to look for good candidates. I'm looking for parties outside of the ludicrous ""Red vs Blue"" Spectrum. I still want to believe that the system can work. So help it prove itself to me.  EDIT: Climate Change bit, I believe it's man made. Also, stop reminding me how little power the president has. I'm using that election as an example because the 2008 was my very first federal Election, and Barack Obama's deceit and betrayal had a profound impact on my attitude in regards to American Politics.

His power is roughly similar to that of Congress, which is roughly similar to that of the Supreme Court. No one can get anything significant done without the others going along with it, and that is by design because of the long history of people getting unchecked power and going a little crazy about it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That being said, the Federal stuff is the stuff that voting matters the least for. More voters = less any one vote matters. Also because of the &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; number of topics that are covered on the Federal Level and the fact that we cast &lt;em&gt;ONE&lt;/em&gt; vote for &lt;em&gt;ALL&lt;/em&gt; the topics you aren&amp;#39;t going to get someone in office who agrees with you across the board. Every single candidate at this level is there for two reasons: They&amp;#39;re people that everyone can live with but no one actually likes, or they were able to whip people into a frenzy on a single topic and no one else can live with them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That seems pretty dismal when it comes to the case for voting, right? Except President and Congress aren&amp;#39;t the things that matter when you go to vote. It&amp;#39;s the City or County positions that matter most to what is actually happening right now around you. Want a higher minimum wage? The City/County can do that. Want a reduction in the number of drug users incarcerated? The City/County can do that. You&amp;#39;re talking about a race decided by dozens or hundreds of votes, not thousands. You&amp;#39;re talking about people you can have a real conversation with, not someone whose correspondence goes through three levels of interns summarizing stuff. They actually do stuff and they desperately need votes.  You&amp;#39;re also more likely to see views like your own here, this is the level where self-identifying socialists and Constitution Party folks actually win.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even state offices, which control rules on firearms, marriage, and can also do minimum wage rules are decided by mere thousands. A relatively minor organization can and do swing those elections all the time. This is also the level were Libertarians and Green Party folks can win.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you want to see your voice matter, keep your view local, talk to your representatives, and make friends you can to vaguely political things with. Then you&amp;#39;re actually part of the process. If you don&amp;#39;t, then you are either buying what Group-that-doesn&amp;#39;t-really-care-about-you A or Group-that-doesn&amp;#39;t-really-care-about-you B.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe that Climate Change is the cause of humanity&amp;#39;s rising consumption of fossil fuels&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think you got that backwards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re talking specifically about voting in the Presidential elections, I&amp;#39;d probably agree with you--its fairly pointless.  However, I think there is a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of utility in voting on local issues, and maybe on state level issues.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A few examples: &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kshama_Sawant""&gt;Kshama Sawant&lt;/a&gt;, a socialist, got elected to Seattle City Council by a grassroots movement, and against an incumbent Democrat.  And this arguably had a major effect on the minimum wage campaign that was successful there recently.  Regardless of what you think of minimum wage, this is a pretty good example where elections were effectively used to counter the two-party system.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another example is in the city of Richmond, California, which hosts Chevron&amp;#39;s biggest oil refinery.  People in the city have long suffered some pretty bad environmental externalities form the plant, but City Council has always been on the side of Chevron due to kickbacks and whatnot.  However, &lt;a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/us/chevron-hits-rough-patch-in-richmond-calif.html""&gt;over the past ten years ordinary people organized&lt;/a&gt; and now the Council is evenly split between people on Chevron&amp;#39;s payroll, and people who are anti-Chevron and want better environmental protections.  Another example of voting being effective at making tangible changes in people&amp;#39;s lives.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR On the federal level voting may be bullshit, but on the local level there is a lot of potential to contest the two parties, and voting is a key part of this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Your moral right to the fruits of your labor in excess of your needs does not outweigh your moral obligation to see to health and care of your fellow citizens.,"There is a substantial resistance to the idea that the wealthiest Americans have a moral obligation to pay a larger share of taxes as part of funding the ACA.  The way I've seen the counterpoint argued is generally something along the lines of ""I'd love it if everyone could get good healthcare too, but that can't be paid for by unicorns and rainbows"".  This seems to imply a principle that while helping people is nice and all, it would be immoral to take from others - their right to the fruits of their labor outweighs any benefit that can be garnered from providing healthcare to a faceless ""other"".  Is there a moral principle I'm missing that should compel me to believe my sovereignty over funds in excess of my sustenance needs demands higher authority than the need of others to survive?  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"CMV: I think Shia Labouf's claim of ""rape"" is offensive to rape victims everywhere","Recently, Shia Labouf did an art installation where he invited people to come and do whatever they wanted to him. He laid out various utensils, some pleasant and some unpleasant, on a table in front of him, and put a bag over his head in a room of complete privacy.  He could have stopped it at any moment, and chose not to. He also gave (some form of) explicit permission for the person to do as they pleased. The fact that he is using the same word to describe this as forced sex using violence or drugs is, to me, appalling. Rather open to hearing other sides of this, though, so please change my view.

In fact, I would be a little inclined to agree with you, so long as we can also agree that the following situation would be just as offensive:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A woman and a man come back to her apartment after a date.  They have sex.  At no point does she explicitly give consent to any sexual activity, but she made no attempt to stop the activity nor did she explicitly ask/tell him to stop.  Afterwards, she starts saying the whole ordeal was rape.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to the standard of affirmative consent, both of these situations would be &amp;quot;rape&amp;quot;.  Does that really make sense?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really have an answer, but, in the context of the ongoing debate on consent and college rape, I must point out: if we are going to call the second scenario rape, then we have to agree that Shia Lebeouf was as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All that said, even if we agree that the standard of &amp;quot;affirmative consent&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t practical, I think there is a strong argument, which I see others have already made, that he didn&amp;#39;t give &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; consent for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; sexual activity, which would still make it rape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your point is that he essentially brought it upon himself.  That he was asking for it by putting himself in a situation where it could happen, by creating a context where the premise was that anybody could do anything to him, so he can&amp;#39;t complain when somebody does something to him.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem is that your conclusion doesn&amp;#39;t follow from your justification.  We have to ask, &amp;quot;Would consent have to be given explicitly in this context?&amp;quot;, and the answer is yes:  engineering a situation where somebody &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do anything to him without fear of reprisal -- in order to make a point -- is not equivalent to agreeing to have sex with anybody.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The assumption that certain things might happen doesn&amp;#39;t mean that he consented to those things.  It&amp;#39;d be like walking into an enemy camp to kill a general; you might assume that you&amp;#39;d be killed if you&amp;#39;re captured, and yes, you&amp;#39;re putting yourself in a situation where you could be captured, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you&amp;#39;re okay with being captured.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The real point of contention is whether he consented to everything that would happen to him or if he simply allowed people to do whatever they wanted to him; the language of another installation with similar (if not the same) rules says that Abramović took a passive role, not a willing one.  It seems fair to say that Shia, given his outrage, also intended his role to be passive, not willing, and in sex, both parties have to take a willing role or the sex is not consensual.  The audience member was the one who made the choice to do what she did to him, whereas he simply didn&amp;#39;t resist.  I&amp;#39;m unclear on how or why you think having sex with that woman was his decision.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There could, conceivably, be a context in which consent is explicitly given from the outset, but in this morally dubious situation, we cannot assume that consent was implied from what we know.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s right to say that he was raped.  Having sex with that woman certainly wasn&amp;#39;t his will, even if he put himself in a context where someone could have sex with him.  To sum this up by saying what I&amp;#39;ve already said, allowing people to do things to you isn&amp;#39;t the same thing as willing people to do things to you, and for it to have been consensual, it would&amp;#39;ve had to have been his will too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"Arguments that laws that make people more safe (DUI laws, Statutory Rape etc) also make people more free are intellectually dishonest. CMV.","* Laws against drinking and driving reduce the number of traffic fatalities, this makes driving a safer experience. * Laws against drinking and driving exist to restrict people from partaking in such an activity. * Drinking and driving is something that some people want to or enjoy doing, even if they understand the risks involved to themselves and others.  The two most relevant definitions of freedom are   * the absence of necessity, coercion, or constraint in choice or action  * unrestricted use  You are equally free to choose to drive with or without drinking and driving laws.  You may choose not to because it is less safe in the absence of drinking and driving laws, but you are not coerced or constrained from driving.  You are not restricted from driving.  Drinking and driving laws do however coerce someone to not partake in that activity.  The activity is also restricted.  * Drinking and driving laws therefor limit freedom but increase safety.  * To argue that drinking and driving laws ""make me more free because..."" are intellectually dishonest, since you are equally free to drive with or without the additional risk of drunk drivers.   Your perception of risk does not make you more or less free.  The use of freedom in these arguments is dishonest.  Since you are equally free to drive either way, but drunk drivers are not equally free to choose to drive while drunk.  edit : we're done here folks.  Turns out this is a debate between -\+ liberty now.  &gt;Freedom in America comes from a distinctly negative connotation, and as a nation we are negative freedom oriented. But this specific scenerio is in fact a situation of ""positive freedom.""The conflict really arrives out of the fact that in a negative nation, something that is positive really creates a neutral scenario of sorts and the language becomes muddled because of this.So this does in fact become a different debate (I've issued a delta to the person that pointed this out).What this is really about is that America is a negative freedom nation and that DUI laws are a positive freedom scenario. So the use of the word freedom in here is... well odd. I'm not sure it's right or wrong yet, but it's certainly atypical because it is an atypical alignment of freedom (for our nation).Certainly drinking and driving laws violate the ideas of negative freedom and our nation is oriented to such a predilection. So the introduction of positive freedom usage is at the very least non-traditional. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take issue with your third premise, OP, on two counts. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Firstly, I would argue that the majority of drunken drivers did not make an informed choice (re: &amp;quot;even if they understand the risks&amp;quot;) to commit their particular crime.  Secondly, well, this is a larger issue with your post. Societies restrict the behavior of individuals for a lot of reasons, not all of them good, but usually because those behaviors in some way infringe on the rights of others. Someone may want to drive drunk or enjoy drunken driving as a recreational activity. That doesn&amp;#39;t validate the act of drunken driving, which is more likely to kill other drivers, pedestrians, bikers, etc. than sober driving. Similarly, to choose an extreme case, we restrict the ability of citizens to murder other citizens because we believe people have a right to live without being murdered. The desires of the murderer are irrelevant. A freedom to harm others has been removed, so that people are free to live with a greater likelihood of not being harmed. That&amp;#39;s the balance a good law creates. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You posit that &amp;quot;You are equally free to choose to drive without drinking and driving laws. You may choose not to because it is less safe, but you are not coerced...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I mean, technically, yes, but this is a little strange to see in a post whose main complaint is against intellectual dishonesty. No outside entity would be restricting me from driving in a drunken-driver-filled world, but saying &amp;#39;You&amp;#39;re free to make this choice that is more likely to kill you&amp;#39; does not strike me as a truly free choice. If I have a knife at your throat, OP, and am telling you to sign a contract or be killed, by your argument this would still be a free choice. I wouldn&amp;#39;t be restricting your actions. You could still choose not to sign and subsequently die. I could still choose to go on the road and subsequently get hit by a drunken driver. It&amp;#39;s all about what you define as a restriction, and for me, knowing that a given behavior carries a higher risk will usually restrict my actions, whether or not an external entity is imposing that restriction. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I might go even further and say that in both cases, laws and no laws, that there is an external restriction. One restriction is a legal penalty, the other is an increased risk of death or injury. In one case, a formal entity is imposing it; in others, the state of the world is imposing it. In both cases, I am free to make a choice. I can break the law and drive drunk anyway. I can get on the road when I know it&amp;#39;s unsafe. Neither the law nor common sense would actually prevent me from the free exercise of my will; they would, however, dictate the consequences of my choices. If you accept that knowledge of the consequences constitutes a restriction, independent of the ability to exercise one&amp;#39;s free will in the sense that a human can choose to perform any action they can perform, then both the law and the external risk of death or injury qualify as restrictions. Therefore, sober motorists in a drunken-driver world are not free in that sense. Legislating against drunken driving removes, or at least lessens, the external restriction of death or injury while imposing another external restriction, that is, penalties against drunken driving. One freedom (to drunkenly drive) is lessened, while another (to use the road with less risk of injury/death) grows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The freedom you describe in the OP might be called &amp;quot;negative freedom&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;freedom from...&amp;quot; because it is freedom from restrictions.  There is also another form of freedom thought about called &amp;quot;positive freedom&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;freedom to...&amp;quot; because the increase in ability, knowledge or access gives you the freedom to do things that you could not have previously done.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this case, a drink driving law impinges upon your negative freedom, because you now no longer have the freedom to drive while drunk.  You are restricted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, you now have increased positive freedom to drive around.  Why?  Because there is less chance that you will be hit by a drunk-driver.  Barring drunk-drivers from the roads make the roads safer and increases our access to driving.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, sure, your negative freedom is impacted, but your positive freedom is increased.  Only if you use the definition of negative freedom do laws &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; decrease your freedom.  However, be aware that that may not be the definition that everyone is using in all circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"I believe that personal firearms can do nothing to ""prevent tyranny"" in the modern age. CMV","During discussions of gun control in the U.S., I often hear folks use rhetoric about defending ourselves from the government. This argument seems disingenuous or just not well thought out. The armed components of the government (the military, the police, the FBI, etc.) have weapons and information technology/infrastructure that so far surpass that of ordinary citizens that personal firearms seem almost inconsequential. While I don't believe the government **should** have a monopoly on physical coercion, it seems to me that individual citizens are just plain outmatched. If the government wants to kill/imprison/deprive you of liberties, it can pretty much do so with impunity, and no amount of personally owned firepower is going to be able to stop it.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it like this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re a leader, presented with one of two scenarios. In both of them, you are going to use force to extort your people or do something that they don&amp;#39;t like. Something that would make them want to fight back, though it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what exactly it is. Use your imagination.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are the leader of an unarmed or very poorly armed population. You use your power to coerce the people into cooperating with your demands. They do so, and they are completely helpless and no more is heard about this injustice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are the leader of a reasonably well-armed (in terms of weapons available to consumers) population. You can easily overpower them, and in a fight they&amp;#39;ll go pretty quickly. But now you&amp;#39;ve got a bigger problem. That one or two-day operation that you had planned has turned into one or two weeks, or even longer. People are holing up in barns and houses and hospitals and fighting back. They&amp;#39;re obviously losing, but they&amp;#39;re making it extremely difficult for you to do anything. Meanwhile, the international community has caught wind of you raining bullets on your people for weeks on end as they desperately fight back. You are now much more of a villain, and it is very likely that everything you try to do in the future will be hampered by this ugly incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s absurd to believe that a group of rural gun-owners could overthrow the government with whatever they bought at gun shows, but it&amp;#39;s not about absolute dominance on one side or the other. It&amp;#39;s about a statement and a challenge. When you own a gun, you&amp;#39;re saying &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;ll win, but I&amp;#39;m going to make this as hard as humanly possible for you&amp;quot; (assuming of course that the government is out to get you which it is not in most cases). Owning weapons gives Americans a bargaining chip. It isn&amp;#39;t that they can now overthrow the government, it&amp;#39;s that the government now has to work &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; harder, and has to be willing to commit far more heinous acts against its own people in order to coerce them forcefully. We are basically forcing the government to go &amp;quot;all in&amp;quot; if they want to coerce us with force. In a government-versus-citizen situation, the government can get what it wants, but it has to be willing to go all the way in order to accomplish that goal against an armed citizen, and it is very rare that governments in first-world countries are willing to do that. That is the value of having the right to bear arms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Federal Government isn&amp;#39;t the only government.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of cases in American History where the tyranny comes from one or several very powerful men taking functional control over from a local or state government. A prime example being the Johnson County War, where several wealthy men attempted to force farmers from their land via an ad campaign, harassment, and murder. They even wound up taking a train load of mercenaries from Texas to Wyoming by train. They were stopped by the local farmers defending themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Who else could have? I mean, the Governor of Wyoming sent the US Army &lt;em&gt;to protect the hired gunslingers&lt;/em&gt;. In most cases of strike and civil unrest the state militia or national guard rarely protects the interest of local community, strikers, or private citizens.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Local police departments are occasionally seized by State of Federal agencies due to similar kinds of widespread corruption. This isn&amp;#39;t legitimate use of state power, this is criminal hijacking of that power. In a situation like that the only recourse is personal arms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Besides, the government can easily overrun a person in one instance, but there is only so many times it can before it finds itself facing off against a general resistance. While it could continue to operate, it is enough to argue for restraint. After all, the threat of force is usually much stronger than the application of force.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: Beauty and the Beast is NOT one of the greatest Disney movies.,"It has come to my attention that if you talk to any movie buff about greatest Disney movies made, Beauty and the Beast always - somehow - weasels itself into their lists. I'm not going to say the movie's awful, because it's not. I'm not even going to say it's bad. And while I did enjoy this movie, I never thought it was something great or revolutionary.   For the sake of argument, I'll list my problems with it:  1. Belle.  I find her to be void of personality whatsoever. She's very 2D like the old princesses such as Snow White or Aurora. And she's also somewhat of a Mary Sue. What is the likely hood that the prettiest girl in all of the town is also the most well-read, articulate, modest, selfless and non judgemental? She's too perfect of a character for me, with her only negative counterparts being that she is some of those descriptions to a fault.   - The love story.  Beast is an ACTUAL Beast. He's not just beastly/ very hard on the eyes, he's an actual monster/animal looking thing. He's not human. Like, at all. Belle has no way of knowing that he was once a human and cursed into being a beast. Sure, she goes into that one wing of the castle and sees a picture of the human him on the wall, but if you're telling me that she pieced everything together after that, you're lying to yourself as well. She willingly fell in love with an animal. In a romantic way. Not to mention the fact that he kidnapped her and she fell in love with him, which I think is commonly referred to as Stockholm Syndrome, but idk.   - Gaston's death.  Why? Why kill him? Because he tried to kill the beast? In Gaston's defence, the Beast is almost the same character, but with a second chance at redemption. To me killing Gaston was the easy way of just burying that story. We're supposed to hate Gaston and love the Beast but they're just too similar that I can't have such opposing views on them. At least Gaston was humorous and got a song.   - Human Beast (appearance wise)  No.  - Timing/ pacing  There actually seemed to be a very minimal time that went past in this movie. There was hardly any interaction between the two, thus making me feel as though the love between them didn't exist at all.   - The initial conflict.   I don't have too big of a problem with this, but his consequences for being a dick don't seem to fit. He gets turned into a beast, which sounds about right, but where my problem lies is where he can't be turned back into a human unless he learns to love another and be loved by another. This, on paper, seems fine, but at the end of the day, he falls in love with the prettiest girl in town. How does that prove anything? I know it's Disney and the possibility of an ugly female love-interest doesn't exist, but it seems a little counter productive to have the man who judges people off of how they look to fall in love with the prettiest girl.   /rant  It should be noted again that I don't hate this movie, I rather enjoy it. But there are far better Disney movies out there.  It should also be noted that while I find most of the songs in this movie to be forgettable as hell (how many are there? 3?), I rather enjoy the scene of Tale As Old As Time/ Beauty and the Beast.  So. Change my views.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Beast disarms him, and has him by the neck over the chasm, at which point Gaston begs for his life. We then see Beast&amp;#39;s face soften (perhaps realizing, as you said, that Beast and Gaston are very similar). Beast puts him down on the ledge and tells him to leave (giving him a second chance). At this point Belle shows up, Beast goes to her, Gaston literally stabs Beast in the back, loses his footing and falls to his death. None of the characters &amp;quot;punish&amp;quot; Gaston, he is killed by his fatal flaw, pride.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On a few of your other points, I would say Belle is willful, and has a &amp;#39;curiosity killed the cat&amp;#39; streak. Her father would have been happier if she hasn&amp;#39;t followed him, and therefore stayed out of danger.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t get your objection to the Beauty and the Beast falling in love montage either. Clearly time passes, and you see the Beast changing through things like eating his soup with a spoon instead of slurping it - those are improvements he is making for Belle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, as you pointed out, Belle is the smartest person in town. When she sees the painting, she realizes the young man&amp;#39;s eyes are the same as Beast&amp;#39;s. Also, doesn&amp;#39;t someone tell her the story of the Fairy pretty soon after that?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In any case, like the movie or don&amp;#39;t, but some of your objections don&amp;#39;t seem to be drawn from the actual &amp;quot;text&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: Christianity is all-powerful because they stack the deck in their favor.,"First I would just like to note that I am writing this in a neutral position. I am neither for nor against the motion of Christian propaganda.  With that being said, I have meditated and experienced first hand the effects a large gathering of Christians can have on the mindset of a person without a belief system.  After visiting a couple church sermons I am amazed at how fast a church is capable of taking someone with a completely opposite mindset and conforming them instantly within a couple sermons. I am even more astounded by how fast churches are capable of taking children and within a week they've got the child radically supporting an adopted belief system.  I thought to myself, ""Either Christianity is so true that a good preacher can convert masses out of how obvious the belief system is, or there is some sort of fallacy going on here."" Here's what might be happening:  Take this first set of statements.  - God exists  - God doesn't exist  Rationally, the average person should be able to live their life with an opinion that both possible statements exist as equally as each other, even though their contradictory.  However, the statements are usually phrased like this. - God exists. He is all loving, all powerful, and he is governing the universe with his sense of perfection.  There is no god. There is no perfect, all-powerful loving being protecting us from harm. The world is not perfect.  Even though both those statements have an equal value of being true, if we believe that the world is governed by a perfect, loving, supreme being, we would feel a lot happier.  Therefore, before anyone even enters a church, they are already primed to want to believe one statement over the other, even though they know rationally that both statements are equal in value. It's a positive outlook bias that our brain performs in order to lead our minds into believing things that make us feel good inside.  Now let's look at these statements:  - When we die, we are reborn and live eternally.  - When we die, nothing happens.  The first statement makes you feel better, therefore you're more likely to believe it. What happens after that, is the church plays on anticipation.  - When we die, we go to Heaven where we are blissfully happy and reunited with our loved ones.  - When we die, nothing happens.  In the first statement, you have something to look forward to. In the second statement, you have nothing to look forward to.  This is the same as flipping a coin and getting a hundred bucks if it lands on heads. Even though you know rationally that either possibility is just as likely the other, you want to believe more that the coin is going to land on heads.  So, is the church converting massive amounts of people weekly because Christianity is so obviously true? Or do pastors already have the deck stacked in their favor before nonbelievers even walk in the door?  My view is they have the deck stacked in their favor.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This is the fallacy you&amp;#39;re looking for.  It&amp;#39;s not at all true that two mutually exclusive propositions have an equal chance of being true.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll give you an example.  Let&amp;#39;s suppose you and I are having a conversation, and I tell you that there is a tribe of invisible elves living underneath my floorboards with whom I communicate telepathically.  What would it take to convince you I was telling the truth?  If you try to come up with any empirical means for discovering the elves&amp;#39; existence, I&amp;#39;d just say they are intangible and invisible and undetectable, in other words you have to take my word for it.  Is there an equal chance that I am either right and telling the truth or lying to you?  Of course not.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is most likely to be true is whatever has the most evidence for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;What happens after that, is the church plays on anticipation. When we die, we go to Heaven where we are blissfully happy and reunited with our loved ones. When we die, nothing happens. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a classic false dichotomy.  In other words, this is setting up the choice as if it&amp;#39;s only between two options when in fact there are many more options.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What you&amp;#39;re basically saying is Christianity offers a choice between two options:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;You believe in God, accept Christianity, and go to heaven after death.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You reject belief in God, deny Christianity, and go to hell after death.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is what is known as &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal&amp;#x27;s_Wager""&gt;Pascal&amp;#39;s Wager&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;#39;s a logical fallacy.  For one, what about all the other religions, why merely Christianity?  What about Islam?  What about Hinduism?  How do we know which one is right?  The choice isn&amp;#39;t between Christianity and atheism, it&amp;#39;s between Christianity, atheism, and about a thousand other religions.  If Christianity turns out to be wrong, and Islam is true, you&amp;#39;re still going to Hell even though you chose religion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, is the church converting massive amounts of people weekly...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is also simply not true.  Where is your source for this?  Both irreligion/atheism (lack of religion) and Islamic beliefs are growing faster than Christianity.  In fact, in some countries, Christianity is on the downfall.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it seems you have this idea of &amp;quot;nonbelievers walking into the door&amp;quot; as if this is a common occurence.  In reality, the &lt;strong&gt;vaste majority of people who are Christian are born into Christian families&lt;/strong&gt;.  As somebody who was both a Christian and active participant of a Christian church for two decades, new converts who are &amp;quot;unbelievers&amp;quot; are very, exceedingly rare.  About 95% of Christian church goers were born into it, so any growth in the church is likely due to families having more kids. &lt;a href=""http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/""&gt;This is precisely why Islam is growing faster than Christianity&lt;/a&gt;, not because it is more pursuasive, but because Islamic families are simply having more babies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So to sum up, Christianity does not have the deck stacked in their favor any more than any other religion because the example you used of choosing between unfavorable no afterlife and the more favorable heaven could be used by &lt;em&gt;any religion&lt;/em&gt;, not just Christianity.  Furthermore, Christianity is not spreading nearly as quickly as other religions and nonreligion itself.  Finally, the reason people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; join Christianity is almost always because they were born into it, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; because they were converted.  The number of actual converts from evangelism is strikingly low compared to indoctrination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every religion and philosophy does the sort of thing you are talking about, tweaking its message to its audience. That&amp;#39;s charisma 101, you adjust your words to your audience.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t explain why there are billions of christians worldwide by saying that a few of them are charismatic. You need something unique to Christianity that other religions don&amp;#39;t have.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_of_Christianity""&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_of_Christianity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Christianity has a strong history of caring for the sick. As well as this increasing their numbers during plagues, this means that while others flee to the countryside, Christianity stays within cities, the centers of power, building up their influence and numbers. Other religions often have much less of a tradition of caring for the sick.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They prohibit birth control, abortion, and infanticide. It&amp;#39;s fairly well known that atheists and non believers in the west have a fairly low birth rate on average. This is amplified by their belief in slowing their reproduction. If Christians produce more babies and convert their babies (children are easier to convert) then there will be more Christians.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They allow women to perform worship and get involved, making their religion sexier. It&amp;#39;s fairly well known in the modern world that many atheist groups are mostly male. e.g.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2011/02/gender-disparity-on-daylight-atheism/""&gt;http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2011/02/gender-disparity-on-daylight-atheism/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That means that if you join some sort of atheistic group and are a straight male you&amp;#39;re much less likely to get laid. The same was true of many pagan religions. This meant that the rate of secondary conversions was pretty low.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you look at the leadership of much of modern atheism, it&amp;#39;s heavily male dominated, and women frequently complain that their concerns, as such, are not heard. This makes it less effective at converting.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for factors that explain the rise of religion these sort of things are likely more important than rationality, which is present in every religion and group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Internet speeds above 20Mbps aren't useful for most people.,"I've noticed trends of faster and faster Internet speeds. Not usually where I live, but yes, there's a voice inside me that yells ""more fasterer! Better! Better!""  Now, I know there are some people with big bandwidth requirements -- those doing some major file sharing, or maybe needing a big pipe for a VPN to work. But I think that in the commercial marketplace, that's a small percentage.  I thought about this recently when a friend of mine was looking at his options for getting Internet services. He opted for the cable modem at 25 Mbps because it was faster than the DSL offering at 12Mbps, which is what I have. And I thought about it, knowing what he'll do online... surf the web, stream some audio, watch Netflix once in a while -- and even for that, 12 is overkill, let alone 25.  I know that the providers have to have significant bandwidth in their infrastructure, but I feel that consumer offerings of 25, 30, 50 Mbps and more are really just selling people the *idea* of a super fast connection that they'll really never use.

So the link is 100x faster than the actual usage will ever be. The reasoning i latency. The faster the connection, the faster the responsiveness of the sites on the other end. so now you look at the average web page, which is about a meg and a half (and growing fast) [1].&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Users prefer pages that render in 100ms or less. Pages that render in 1 second feel &amp;quot;sluggish&amp;quot;.

At 100Mbs that page renders in 0.096 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, a 100Mbs connection makes the web feel &amp;quot;instantaneous&amp;quot;, a 10Mbs connection makes the web feel &amp;quot;sluggish&amp;quot; and a 1Mbs connection is aggravating when downloading the &amp;quot;average&amp;quot; web page.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1: &lt;a href=""http://3vavpsbeqbk19ao0rfgkqm17sj.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/page-growth.gif""&gt;http://3vavpsbeqbk19ao0rfgkqm17sj.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/page-growth.gif&lt;/a&gt; 2: &lt;a href=""http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/perceived-performance""&gt;http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/perceived-performance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Of course there are a thousand reasons why this simple high level argument breaks down, caching, sluggish remote servers, packet loss.. etc. But internet connection speed is always a factor is the perceived speed of the internet up until that roughly 100Mbs mark.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(Also note that the web page size is in mega BYTES, where the download speed is in mega BITS, so you need to multiply the web page size by 8 to make a fair comparison)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your probably right,  99% of the time i don&amp;#39;t need that fast of a connection.

CMV: I think that parents who catch others molesting their kids should face consequences for seriously injuring the molester.,"[This view was triggered by this post, and I will be using it to draw examples from.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/2b2gh1/father_beats_up_man_who_he_caught_sexually/) Basically I can't begin to understand the rage felt by parents in this situation. I would guess it to be unbearable, but rage never excuse one from their actions. I could excuse some degree of injury to the perpetrator, but their are countless cases of parents severely or even kill the perpetrator, and I feel like this should face penalty under the law. While I wouldn't think a maximum sentence was necessary some form of punishment would be. ~~As a society if this is allowed to happen then the door is open for people to take justice into their own hands, and that is a very dangerous concept.~~  As a side note I'm sure some examples of it going this way can occur, but for everyone against my view that is provided I could find one supporting it. So the discrepancy between cases is another problem in this as well.    Edit: My view has shifted from thinking full charges are necessary to reduced charges are fine. My main problem is that they are rarely brought to trial.  Edit 2: Vigilante part is gone. Now it's down to the core view. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

In an affirmative defense, the accused admits to committing the criminal act but provides a justification or excuse for their actions--duress, necessity, insanity, self-defense, etc. In such cases, a successful affirmative defense reduces or even entirely removes culpability for a criminal act. One famous example of an affirmative defense was &amp;quot;the burning bed&amp;quot; case, where a battered woman essentially lost her mind and burned up her abusive husband while he slept. She was found not guilty of murder by reason of temporary insanity. So, while she faced consequences for her actions, the jury decided that she was not of sound mind at the time and therefore not responsible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors generally have a fair amount of discretion when deciding whether to bring charges against an individual for criminal actions. They must weigh the cost of a trial against the probable outcome based on the strength of their case. I can&amp;#39;t imagine that too many prosecutors would be willing to spend the time and money to prosecute a person for assaulting someone who &lt;em&gt;in the process&lt;/em&gt; of raping their child. It is highly likely that a jury would be willing to excuse such behavior, especially in the heat of the moment, and the trial would be a waste of taxpayer money.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I could excuse some degree of injury to the perpetrator, but their are countless cases of parents severely or even kill the perpetrator, and I feel like this should face penalty under the law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Countless cases of vigilante assault and/or murder that are never charged? I find this difficult to believe. I found a case of a Texas man who wasn&amp;#39;t charged when he beat the man raping his daughter to death, but again, he caught the rapist in the act and Texas law allows for lethal force when addressing aggravated sexual assault. Another woman actually faced consequences for shooting a man accused of raping her son, and she was convicted of a lesser charge in her first trial phase. I found several cases of inmates being charged with murder for beating convicted molesters to death. Where are these countless uncharged cases?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what country you are from but I am only really familiar with the court system here in the US.

"I don't believe the media shapes culture, i believe our culture shapes media. CMV.","There seems to be a widely-held belief that news, commercials, toys, and mass marketing are deliberate attempts to control the public's expectations and norms. A few examples of this phenomena are the idea that ""Fox news is brainwashing its viewers"", ""the media is trying to force everyone in America to become consumers"", and ""Media is trying to force women to conform to one specific ideal of beauty"".  I do not believe this. I think that the people who watch Fox news are already convinced that they're right, and simply want to see a TV show which shows a variety of highly credentialed talking heads grimly agreeing with them. They want to feed their bias, and they want to feel like they're ahead of the curve. And to be clear, this goes equally for people who watch MSNBC for the same reasons. People who consume drive-by journalism do so because they like how it makes them feel, and because they likely didn't have a strong affinity for correctness in the first place. Not because the media is stamping out their critical thought.  Similarly (for my second example above), people love being consumers. Nobody needed the media to want instant gratification - that is simply our nature. This is backed up by a dozen studies in primate behavior. All animals (us included) seem to prefer a bird in the hand over two in the bush, regardless of the cost of the one in hand. Further, individuals don't buy nice furniture and brag about their 57"" TVs because the media tells them to, they do it because they want to feel like they've got something special. Something that others ought to pat them on the back for. This isn't new, the entire concept of luxury goods extends back as long as human history.  Therefore, i believe that the idea that the media is forming our expectations and behaviors is ludicrous. It confuses the rise of mass media with the rise in mass manufacturing, and is trying to pin blame for human nature on a specific set of technology that caters directly to human nature - advertising.  Thanks for your time, i don't expect to CMV overnight, but i don't have any doubts about this topic, which makes me worry that perhaps i'm falling into the same trap that i'm describing.  EDIT: commas everywhere.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I disagree with your submitted view. I think it&amp;#39;s both ways. Feedback, as others have said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although there is deliberation involved, it&amp;#39;s not an effect of the media itself. Media is injected with symbolic and linguistic programming that our minds are receptive to.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Look to Youtube, Memetics, Hashtags, twitter, viral media, slang, etc. forms of media. People become acculturated. These things influence behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People create culture. People create media. Media is a part of culture. Culture is a part of media. Culture creates media, and media shapes culture. Stories can change us. They can influence our view. There&amp;#39;s symbols and words and arrangements of things that convey meaning and information. They&amp;#39;re programmed. The mind is receptive. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Media can show people things they wouldn&amp;#39;t have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not as if the media is wracking your brain and controlling you to do and say and believe this or that like a puppeteer. The degree of awareness per individual mind play into the degree of influence of media.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It influences, even when it&amp;#39;s as simple as a food advert, or a thought of opinion upon an event. A suggestion here, an attribution there, just like people you talk with have that ability.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those who are in control have influence, as mis4mike has said. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You might find the work of Doug Rushkoff interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree that today&amp;#39;s media is a direct result of our culture today, and that culture in general shapes the media, but that relationship isn&amp;#39;t mutually exclusive with the media in turn being able to shape the direction of culture. Culture leading to media is a simple law of supply and demand - the fact that there&amp;#39;s a significant population with a conservative leaning and biases is what led to Fox News&amp;#39; inception. But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that those who work at Fox don&amp;#39;t have their own leanings, biases, or agendas that they will consciously or unconsciously express in their coverage. With the exception of a few non-profits, essentially all media outlets have the primary agenda of making money, and even non-profits at least need donors and a steady viewer base to stay afloat. And given a media outlet&amp;#39;s inherent credibility in its viewers&amp;#39; eyes (because if viewers didn&amp;#39;t find it at all credible, they wouldn&amp;#39;t watch it) and the sheer amount of exposure , their coverage and opinions tend to carry a fair amount of weight. Saying that the media doesn&amp;#39;t influence people&amp;#39;s opinions is essentially disregarding that 1) people working in media have no biases or agendas whatsoever, conscious or unconscious, and that 2) people are so firm in their opinions that constant, repeated exposure to an opinion won&amp;#39;t sway their minds. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not to mention that a big part of successful advertising is the exploitation of people&amp;#39;s fears. You might be a little insecure about your weight or body to begin with sure, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean advertisers won&amp;#39;t jump all over that insecurity in an attempt to sell you a product. The media isn&amp;#39;t creating insecurity by any means, but it&amp;#39;s sure as hell magnifying it and bringing it to people&amp;#39;s attention. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Read this &lt;a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/20/world/study-finds-tv-alters-fiji-girls-view-of-body.html""&gt;1999 article&lt;/a&gt; on Fiji and body image, it might sway your mind. Essentially, a high BMI in women was considered attractive in Fiji for centuries, until the island connected with the modern world and girls started seeing skinny girls on television. Anorexia and eating disorders skyrocketed from nonexistent to dangerously problematic on the island in just a few years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: True, people have pre-existing notions and feelings about things, which the media reflects. But the media also can take those notions/insecurities/feelings and exploit them, which has the potential to create culture. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I don't hear any musical quality in the screaming vocals found in many genres of metal music. CMV,"To be precise, I'm thinking of the vocals heard in black metal, death metal and metalcore. Something like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Hv0tsvpyU), for example.  I really have tried to keep an open mind with regard to musical taste, but metal is one genre I've had the most difficulty understanding. Why exactly do people enjoy hearing screaming or growling in songs? I find it flattens out any melodic qualities and tends to make songs practically indistinguishable from each other.   I could add that it's fairly close to hard rock, a genre I enjoy, so this isn't a distaste for heavy/loud/agressive music in general.   **Edit**: *Thank you everyone for the brilliant response, I can say that you've certainly changed my view. Texture, atmosphere and emotion conveyed through the vocals are elements of musical quality that I was ignoring in favour of the more obvious rhythm and melody. Some of you just finding this thread may read /u/DrDerpberg's excellent post and leave it at that, but I'd encourage you to read through more of the comments as there are a ton of interesting arguments and examples!*","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of things you should consider.  Hopefully, they are succinct enough to be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) You will come to &amp;#39;musically&amp;#39; appreciate screaming vocals so long as you first appreciate the music that contains them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Personal experience here, but I couldn&amp;#39;t bear screaming vocals when I started listening to heavy music.  However, I found Opeth&amp;#39;s Still Life so incredibly beautiful, that I had to keep listening.  My fascination with the melodic and story telling aspects of the album compelled me.  With time, I found Akerfedlt&amp;#39;&amp;#39;s vocal performance as spectacular as the other musical components that drew me in.  Now, years and many albums later, I can appreciate metal vocals in any context or simply on their own.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is to say, if you love the music, you will learn to see the beauty and skill in the vocal performances that you are familiar with.  Then, with time, you can build a universal appreciation for metal vocals with that familiarity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The corollary to this point is: don&amp;#39;t force it.  If Cannibal Corpse simply doesn&amp;#39;t do it for you, don&amp;#39;t worry about trying to appreciate the vocals until you have more experience with screaming.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) Consider metal vocals as the only tool capable of conveying the extreme emotional content often contained in metal music.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Screaming and growling are physiologically potent forms of communication.  Like a crying baby, we are programmed to have strong emotional responses to such sounds.  Metal vocals use this to capture the emotions that inspired the music!  (I find this cool in itself.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Consider &lt;a href=""http://music.basickrecords.com/album/tectonics""&gt;Motion&lt;/a&gt;.  The vocals are gut-wrenching in their emotional appeal.  This could not be accomplished with clean vocals, nor without a significant amount of talent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A super important perspective arises out of this: In an argument, if an emotional appeal is made, the responding party must be empathic to the speaker in order for the appeal to be effective.  Metal vocals are no different.  The listener must be responsive to the full emotional content of the performance for the performance to be received well and appreciated.  Most people are not willing to subject themselves to such emotional content, so screaming vocals will never be effective or understood.  This is absolutely fine.  I don&amp;#39;t expect it of anyone.  If you find yourself having trouble appreciating some generic metalcore song about suicide, then its possible you don&amp;#39;t really want to truly engage the subject.  (Which, again, is totally fine.  I usually find such songs not worth the investment.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, if you really want to understand and appreciate such vocals, even from a musical perspective, you&amp;#39;d better be willing to invest yourself emotionally in them.  I cannot stress how critical this is.  You have to open yourself to a full range of emotional experience, including suffering, mourning, rage, etc.  It&amp;#39;s not easy, which is why it took me years to be able to listen to deathcore.  It may be advisable to start off easier, but once you are capable of this, you&amp;#39;ll find some incredibly powerful experiences through metal, which is the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) There is a lot of skill and character involved in screaming.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;a) Simply the training and conditioning necessary for using your voice in that way with out damaging yourself is quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;b) Not all performances are equal.  There are good and bad.  Most people argue that metal can get away with bad ones simply because they can be considered rough or edgy.  But this is a poor argument because let me tell you, bad screaming is really fucking bad.  Really.  However, you will find lots of generic, monotonous vocalists in metal.  Of course, these should be recognized and avoided.  Good vocalists will be powerful and dynamic, often capable of using inflection to activate their voices in a variety of different ways successfully.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;c) Pitch control is just as important as it is in clean vocals.  Depending on the technique, screaming typically involves a fundamental frequency that can be sung in a tonally pure manner (cleanly).  This means, a talented vocalist can seamlessly transition from a clean note to a scream without changing pitch.  (See below for example.)  This also means that screaming is subject to the same pitch scrutiny that a conventional vocalist is.  Metal vocalists also have to hit the right notes with the right inflection, but the notes they hit are often dissonant.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Take &lt;a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaEoBMJ0Xy8""&gt;Eric Kalsbeek&lt;/a&gt;.  Pay careful attention to the pitch of each scream and how it incorporates with the rest of the song as well as the incredible richness and texture of his voice.  And at 3:25, prepare for a spectacular clean to scream transition.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;d) Asians are not all smart.  Conservatives are not all racist.  Metal vocalists do not all sound the same.  If a vocalist takes the time to develop his voice, it will be distinct from other&amp;#39;s.  The more experience you have with screaming, the more you will agree with this.  One can learn to recognize that a vocalist has a unique sound and character.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4) They print lyrics for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Metal lyrics are often indecipherable.  That&amp;#39;s just the truth.  You will get slightly better at understanding with time, but never very good.  However, flip open the lyric book (you bought the cd, right?) and you will find that they really are speaking a language you understand, its just not quite as obvious.  Is this an obstacle to the music itself? Sure, but since when has metal been easy to listen to?  If you invest the time to fully explore the lyrics of a good metal album, I can guarantee that you will get more out of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have three basic ways of explaining my taste in music to people:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;the spicy food approach&amp;quot;: Do you like spicy food? And I don&amp;#39;t mean the painfully hot stuff, which is more of a fringe thing, I just mean stuff like the mild hotness of BBQ sauce or medium salsa on your chips. You would think, if spicy food had never been invented, that the concept of intentionally making your food painful to eat (even in small amounts) would be something exactly 0% of people enjoy. But in reality, most people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; enjoy some amount of spiciness, mostly because it makes food more interesting, or because it provides a greater range of ingredients to work with.  I see heaviness in music as being roughly analogous to spiciness in food: some people simply find it painful to eat something and can&amp;#39;t fathom why you would deliberately add food that makes eating painful, while others would have it no other way, and get hooked to spicier and spicier foods, each food providing a bigger thrill than the last. Everyone has a different spiciness threshold, like they do in music, before which spice is enjoyable and beyond which it simply becomes painful. Music is the exact same way, and what you consider unmusical noise is exactly the thing someone else gets a rush of adrenaline from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;everything can be done properly or badly&amp;quot; approach: Vocals in death metal are, admittedly, not used the same way vocals are used in most other kinds of music. They provide a more rhythmic component and tie the instruments together. You linked us to Cannibal Corpse, which is heavier than the example I&amp;#39;ll use, but listen to &lt;a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1FkbvGl-IU""&gt;Take This Life, by In Flames&lt;/a&gt;. Listen all the way up to the chorus, and feel free to stop the song about 2 minutes in. So... not very melodic, right (granted, the vocals are a little more musical than the Cannibal Corpse song you linked, but I can&amp;#39;t find acoustic Cannibal Corpse :P)? Now listen to some guy who deconstructed the guitar riffs, the screaming, and everything else in the song and is playing the &lt;a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPwRsXQs2oc""&gt;song on an acoustic guitar&lt;/a&gt;. Someone who listens to a lot of metal, like me, hears the same subtleties in the screamed vocals that this guy based his acoustic version on. It&amp;#39;s there, you just have to enjoy it enough to hear it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, that said, there are good death metal vocalists and bad ones. Everyone has their favourites, and there are lots of good ones who have different styles. If you just go and pick some random death metal album that nobody&amp;#39;s ever heard of and try to pick up on subtle vocal dynamics, I&amp;#39;m not saying you&amp;#39;ll find them. But then if you listen to some of the best singers, you will see them directing the song in many of the exact same ways that a traditional singer does it, just in an extremely different style. Off the top of my head, one example of really good death metal singing is &lt;a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqdZpxkzNvc""&gt;Lamb of God-Redneck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;the &amp;quot;Are drums music?&amp;quot; approach: Not every instrument is there to fill the same role. In a typical blues/rock/pop/metal band, you have basically the same setup: one to three guitars (three live guitars is rare, but there are almost always at least 3 guitars in recorded music), a bass, a drummer, and a singer. Many bands have keyboardists, some have other instruments like trumpets or saxophones, but for the most part that&amp;#39;s it - a band composed of 2 guitarists, a singer, a drummer, and a bassist can play pretty much anything from Chuck Berry to Cannibal Corpse to Adele. But the way each instrument is used in each genre is radically different, as is the ideal sound (or tone) of each instrument. You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; play Chuck Berry on the same guitar you play Cannibal Corpse on, with the same setup, but it&amp;#39;ll be hard to find a tone that works well on both. You &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; play some Red Hot Chili Peppers on the same bass that you play Adele, but again, the ideal bass sound and playstyle are so different for both those artists that it almost isn&amp;#39;t the same instrument. Instruments play different roles in different styles: to play Adele you barely want to hear the guitar, while if you&amp;#39;re playing Jimi Hendrix the guitar provides a beautiful wall of fuzzy noise weaving in and out of the vocals. Similarly you wouldn&amp;#39;t sing Aretha Franklin the same way you would sing Adele, even if they&amp;#39;re both powerful female vocalists. But wherever the melody comes from, the drums sit back and provide rhythm. If you heard &lt;em&gt;just the drum track&lt;/em&gt; from the greatest hits of the last century (however you define them), you would probably recognize less than 5% of the songs. You would enjoy some of the drums, you&amp;#39;d recognize the songs where the drums lead the intro or chorus, but while listening to the full song you would almost never say &amp;quot;I bet this drummer really knows his musical theory&amp;quot;. So are drums music? If you say yes, you understand that melody is not essential for something to be music, while if you think not, then you see a role for non-music in almost every song recorded in the last 100 years.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Similarly, in metal, the melody doesn&amp;#39;t come from the same places that it does in a lot of other kinds of music. You can&amp;#39;t look at death metal vocals the way you look at Adele: in death metal, the singer is unlikely to provide the melody, and almost acts as more of a rhythmic or atmospheric instrument. A great example is &lt;a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrBrH5PZtcc""&gt;Opeth - Demon of the Fall&lt;/a&gt;. Listen to the first two minutes or so, hearing the vocals not as a dude singing into a microphone but as a background instrument like any other. I think this song rocks even before the vocals come in, but when they do I get chills up and down my spine &lt;em&gt;every damn time&lt;/em&gt; because the vocals so perfectly mirror the feel of the song. It&amp;#39;s almost like looking at a painting missing the last layer of texture, and then the vocals come in and provide that texture. Another example of vocals filling a non-melodic role is older In Flames stuff. I already showed you one of their newer songs (their style has changed a lot), but in the old stuff they had 4 guitars in every song: 2 rhythm and 2 lead, with each pair of guitars harmonized to its twin. Between the 4 guitars, there was plenty enough melody to go around, and the role of the vocals was more to tie it all together than to add a 5th layer of music. Listen to &lt;a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IWSLeAusDo""&gt;Gyroscope&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_gh9p-pWVI""&gt;the entire album Colony&lt;/a&gt; to see how when there&amp;#39;s that much going on with the instruments, an extra layer of &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; singing would just get lost in the mix, while the death metal vocals provide a layer of sound that isn&amp;#39;t there. Another example of singing kicking you in the pants is &lt;a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep_9S9WH8TI""&gt;Quo Vadis - Silence Calls the Storm&lt;/a&gt;: when the song starts, literally every instrument in the band is going balls to the wall, and things could not possibly get heavier, right? Wrong! When the singer kicks in, he is just as loud as everything else, only soars over it all because they&amp;#39;re all playing fast and he just holds that note for what feels like an hour. Try to imagine that song with Aretha Fanklin holding a bluesy vibrato, or even Robert Plant singing &amp;quot;ooh baby&amp;quot; or something - those are undeniably two great singers with incredible styles, but they would seem absurdly out of place in this song.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, that was a huge ramble, I can expand on anything you don&amp;#39;t find credible or want to learn more about but it&amp;#39;s time to shut up. &lt;strong&gt;tl;dr: metal is the spicy food of music, death metal vocals compliment the music in ways that other styles of singing wouldn&amp;#39;t, and just because I like it doesn&amp;#39;t mean every death metal vocalist is any good or that everyone likes the same ones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lastly, a bit of a disclaimer: if metal just isn&amp;#39;t for you, that&amp;#39;s cool. I hope that I never came off as saying you &lt;em&gt;have to learn to love the deth meddle&lt;/em&gt;. I just really love heavy music and was hoping to show you why, and if you still don&amp;#39;t like it that&amp;#39;s fine by me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Holy crap, such an overwhelming response.

I believe that HOAs (Homeowners' Associations) decrease property values by scaring away potential home buyers. CMV,"I don't currently own a home, but I've heard so many HOA horror stories that I know that when I eventually go looking to purchase one, the presence of a HOA will greatly devalue the property for me, and I know many others feel the same way. Given that, I also believe that any increased property values that a HOA might impart are offset by a decrease in value from the HOAs mere presence. This is especially true when a HOA imposes monthly fees on the homeowners. In order to change my view, I would need to see convincing evidence that HOAs in general increase the value of homes.  Somewhat separately, I believe that any serious dispute between neighbors or unruly behavior should be dealt with under local law, and that HOAs are dangerous since they have the legal authority to act much as a local government can, but without significant restrictions or protections. Therefore, HOAs should be generally banned. CMV.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance agent here.  HOAs are important in terms of insurance, especially for condos.  For most condos, the buildings themselves are owned by the HOA and need to be insured under a master policy.  What you own when you purchase a condo unit is everything from the studs in.  Depending on how the CC&amp;amp;Rs are written for a particular HOA, the association can carry the insurance for as much or as little of the structure as is agreed.  This is important, as outside of a written, binding agreement, things can get pretty sticky in the event of a loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOAs (of some kind) are probably necessary if there are any significant pieces of shared property or shared expenses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Examples: building infrastructure in condos, security guards for walled neighborhoods, neighborhood swimming pools/parks, shared private roads, etc., etc.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In order to have such things (generally referred to as public goods), there needs to be an enforceable mechanism to get everyone to share in the costs of supporting them. Are they good? Are the bad? That depends a lot.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But I agree that a lot of HOAs go &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too far, and the fact that they are elected brings to them much the same evils that government has. When you live with an HOA, you can&amp;#39;t really say that you really &amp;quot;own&amp;quot; your property any more, as you don&amp;#39;t have the exclusive right to control and dispose of it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As such, I would never buy a home subject to one, but I can see situations where they could improve property values significantly, just at a cost I&amp;#39;m not willing to bear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV:Voting should require a lincese,"It's a relatively simple idea - much like driving, voting should require an obtainable license. You go through a several months-long course, which teaches you about basic macroeconomics, citizen rights and **obligations**, how to spot a politician lying through his teeth, how the government works, taxation and some other mandatory stuff, after which you take a test (multiple times if needed) and only then are you allowed to vote. Now ultimately the courses could not teach the subjects in-depth, but it should be enough to educate voters on what they can realistically expect and demand from the government and their representative.   The ultimate goal is to have a better educated voting base - a democracy is only as good as the citizen participating in it.  Also - this should be by choice and not thought in school. Why? Because the school system cannot guarantee that the student is going to pay attention or remember everything in class. You might say that this a failing of the educational system, but I'd rather take into consideration the imperfect world we live in. That and things given freely and without effort are often unappreciated, having people work for their right to vote would make it much more dear to them.  Some preemptive Q&amp;A:  &gt;What if the person doesn't have enough time for the course  Then said person probably doesn't have enough time to properly research the candidates and political parties as well, making his vote - uneducated.   &gt;Wouldn't that cut many people off  Yes, that's the point. You remove people who tend to vote based or no information or with false expectations.   &gt;What if someone fails the test   Then they can take it again.  &gt;How would such a system be implemented.   Dunno.  &gt;What stops someone from getting the license and then going ""fuck it""  Because the license would, ideally, need to be renewed every ten years or so.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole validity of this idea revolves around a pair of things. First, that it could be implemented (because an idea that can&amp;#39;t be used is useless). So the &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dunno.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t really all that compelling. But second, and far more importantly, that this class is something which is accessible to everyone and which makes some people &amp;quot;fit&amp;quot; to vote, or at least proves that they are. And you can&amp;#39;t really come up with a sound standard for that. Who decides what these standards are? Who tests them? Who enforces them? The idea of democracy isn&amp;#39;t to come up with the BEST decisions. The idea is that everyone has part of the power, to exercise as they see fit. Only by sharing the power can we share the responsibility. If you start demanding levels of education or certain knowledge, you&amp;#39;re well on your way to forming a privileged upper class that rules over a lower class which it regards as uneducated and unfit to rule even itself. Which is kind of what we worked so hard to get away from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, why do you believe that (American, or whatever country) voters are uneducated? Why do you believe that sending them to a class to learn about &amp;quot;basic macroeconomics, citizen rights and obligations, how to spot a politician lying through his teeth, how the government works, taxation and some other mandatory stuff&amp;quot; is the best way to educate them? Do you think it&amp;#39;s possible that even despite not knowing any of that stuff too well, an average adult still has a fairly decent grasp on politics?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Secondly, why do you believe the average voter needs to be educated in order to produce good results? Do you think it&amp;#39;s possible that in the 200 years of this country&amp;#39;s existence that we have developed systems which counteract voters&amp;#39; ignorance? Do you think it&amp;#39;s possible that uneducated, indifferent citizens play a role in a healthy democracy?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, and most importantly, is it possible that allowing uneducated citizens to vote does have some costs, but also has benefits which outweigh those costs? Do you agree that obtaining the right to participate in democratic governance is a sign of respect, dignity, autonomy, and control for individuals and perhaps for the group they represent?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I can point you toward sources representing the first two paragraphs, if you want, but the last one isn&amp;#39;t exactly something a study could prove.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"There are no ""nice""feminists on this subreddit CMV","So it seems like there have been a rash of articles on feminism recently.  Always the feminists defend their movement by saying that ""bad"" feminists are rare.

Are there any ""nice"" feminists on this subreddit?  I don't think so but it's not something that I'd go to the bank on.    By ""nice"" feminist I mean someone who isn't an anti-male sexist.

I believe the pharmaceutical industry has strong incentives to avoid curing diseases CMV,"&gt; Give a man a fish, feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime  In the logic of the quote above, I believe the pharmaceutical industry has a stronger incentive to 'give a man a fish' - i.e, to develop drugs that will manage diseases and their related symptoms. I do not believe that it is in their mandated profit-seeking interests to develop drugs that would turn a theoretically chronic disease needing constant drugs into a cure which would only need one cycle of treatment. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going based on pure selfishness, which is not necessarily true of most companies, if a company developed a cure for say the common cold. They absolutely would sell it. Why? Because they would obliterate a large money making business of all of their competitors with all the cold medicines out there while simultaneously making a profit that would beat ten years of selling the non-cures, plus they would do this as fast as possible before another company got the same idea and did it first. Why would pharmaceutical companies trust each other on their business practices?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing you have to keep in mind is that while this may be true about the companies in isolation, things like medical research hospitals and universities are also researching these things as well.  These are direct competitors to the pharmaceutical companies in this sense.  If a university publishes a cure for cancer, the pharmaceutical company has been beaten to the punch, and they can&amp;#39;t patent this cure and sell it, while also losing the demand for their non-curative treatments, so they have an incentive to find it themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"I believe that if the US is justified in placing an excise tax on cigarettes, then there should be an excise tax on high-calorie foods like chocolate cake.

"CMV: I believe the 9-11 attacks on the World Trade Center were almost certainly inside jobs, at least in part.","I used to be one of those who did not take the 9-11 'truthers' and 'conspiritards' seriously. Anyone who brought up the idea of a 9-11 related conspiracy was automatically written off in my mind as being a whacko.  But upon re-examining the matter I have found myself seriously questioning the official story myself. Here are the primary things which have led me to strongly question the official story, listed in order of most significant to least significant in my mind.  • The footage of the three buildings that fell clearly show them falling at freefall speed directly into their own footprints. Specifically, footage of the Building 7 collapse actually shows that the building started collapsing from the bottom, with the every part of the building beginning to collapse simultaneously in this way. And the twin towers, despite their height, do not tilt, buckle, or deviate from the freefall patter in any way, even though the damage to them from the planes was asymmetrical. This is a complete affront to my understanding of physics, mathematics, and probability. I consider this the most damning evidence because it is the most readily verifiable, as it can be observed by anyone in footage taken by many different sources at many different angles and distances. It is also the easiest to understand, as even a basic understanding of physics should be sufficient to send up a red flag for an open minded observer. What really made me question the official story for the first time was seeing the footage of the collapse again, 10+ years after I saw it the first time on 9-11, with a much better understanding of physics to serve as context.  • The footage of the newscaster reporting on the collapse of Building 7 when a live image of that building, still standing, can be plainly seen in the background. This is footage can be easily found and verified, although you would have to verify the exact time it was recorded and that the building in the background was in fact WTC7 beyond a shadow of a doubt to be completely certain – although I am aware of no allegations that this was not the case.  • Thermitic materials found in WTC dust by multiple, independent tests, including at least one that was published in a peer-reviewed journal. This has been considered evidence of nano-thermite or thermate being present during the destruction of the WTC towers. I list this beneath the footage of the collapse because I do not personally have the means to verify these tests or the source of the dust, and some have called them into question – though anyone can call something into question.  • Reports from eyewitnesses of molten steel being found inside the WTC ruins. Jet fuel burns at a maximum of about 600°F in open air, although this could be made hotter under confinement conditions. But the lowest possible temperature at which steel can even begin to melt is over 2,000°F. This further suggests the presence of thermate based explosives as they would be able to melt structural steel. Keep in mind that I'm just not talking about the molten material which was seen dripping from where the jets struck, which might have been molten aluminum, but material found in the ruins themselves. However, these reports of molten steel are anecdotal, unless they can be physically verified, and must be considered in that context.  • Reports from eyewitnesses of explosions from the buildings before they collapsed. I have not yet heard these alleged explosions on a recording (though I have not looked hard to find them), so I must also consider this anecdotal, although there are several such independent accounts.  The above evidence, taken together, strongly suggests to me that the official story of 9-11 is not only incomplete, but seriously flawed to the point of being blatantly false. Furthermore, if there was thermate involved in the demolition of the WTC buildings, then someone would have had to have put it there. Such demolitions require precision planning, and someone would have had to do that planning as well. And someone would have had to have had prior knowledge that there would be attacks on the World Trade Center buildings long before 9-11 in order to have executed that planning and placement of explosives. Whether this was merely prior knowledge based on intelligence or actual coordination with those who hijacked the planes is open for debate. The most reasonable conclusion that I can draw from this information is that 9-11 was an inside job, at least in part, and that the government agencies and officials which were involved in investigating 9-11, which would have to have deliberately falsified their reports, must have been involved in that conspiracy to some degree, at very least after the fact in order to cover the backsides of the culprits, if they aren't themselves the culprits, which is also very possible.  I do not pretend to know the details as to how this was pulled off or why. That is missing information, and any statement I make along those lines would be pure speculation based on circumstantial evidence. But I want to have my thoughts and information cross-examined to make sure I’m not making some serious error. Can you change my view?  By the way, as far as I am concerned, the idea of 'expert' opinion is an appeal to authority fallacy, and I do not blindly accept arguments based on expert opinion alone, unless they corroborate with other known facts and logic.

Also, using phone, so if there is a strange typo or word etc, you know why...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Op, I suggest you do different kinds of research about 911. I shared many of the beliefs you did, but I came to a certain realisation: most of the research I did was inherently trying to find certain results. What I mean is, I would watch way, WAY more videos in favor of the conspiracy theories than against. Admittedly, MANY of the videos claiming that 911 was not a conspiracy were ridiculously bad, but a few good ones made me really spend more time to think about it in a different way. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For instance, the nail in the coffin that made me a conspiracy theorist for years was the collapse of building seven, like you yourself mention. It  wasn&amp;#39;t until I specifically searched for anti conspiracy content that I discovered that the building seven content I had seen soo many times was not the only angle. There is in fact a different angle which virtually none of the conspiracy videos I watched bothered to show. The angle makes it clear that building seven was indeed burning severely, and that when viewed from that side, it is very clear that building &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; collapse in a less suspicious way. The video that is often used makes it definitely look like a demolition, but the footage I am talking about does not.

Why not just have the terrorists install the thermite? Why not just crash 10 planes into each building? You really think that the government is so good that they could pull off such a large conspiracy but you don&amp;#39;t think they can come up with a better plan then thermite?

"Disgusted by their antics, I will never vote Republican. CMV","Aside from maybe dogcatcher, Republicans' political antics and many of their policy stances have disgusted me to the point where I can scarcely consider voting for them even a hypothetical option.  * I consider the Shutdown and earlier budgetary show-downs to be exceedingly irresponsible of the Republicans, a party that likes to claim the mantle of responsibility. * I find it callous that the GOP claims the debt and reducing the size of government are the highest priority when their efforts directly hurt people already suffering in a period of slow job recovery. * The GOP's strong ties to the Religious Right are anathema to me. I am an atheist, and I support a scientifically informed view on public policy. Pushing things like prayer in schools, ""intelligent design,"" denying climate change, restrictive sexual mores, and the notion that the United States is a ""Christian nation"" turn me off. * I am not a fan of gun violence (okay, well, who could disagree with that?). I believe we can find reasonable safeguards to reduce the rate of gun violence and number of guns while preserving 2nd Amendment rights. I understand gun culture and hunting are a major part of the rural lifestyle in America, but in urban areas, we associate guns more with crime and murder. * The Republicans like to talk the talk about civil liberties, but I don't think John McCain or Mitt Romney would have done things much differently from Obama in regard to NSA surveillance and other aspects of security theater. * I think we spend too much on the military and rather that money be spent on a social welfare: infrastructure, education, research.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican Party was the one that freed the slaves.

"CMV: Most democracies are far too tolerant of extremism, especially the likes of neo-fascism, neo-nazism, radical Islamism and violent intolerance. The world has been to soft on these ideologies and they need to be eliminated whenever they appear.","I think some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes. It's either the extreme left, or the extreme right. Radicalism almost always leads to violence, and is a plague on democratic society and governments. Since communism has been relegated to just a handful of countries, the far-left has for the most part been dealt with. However the far-right continues to be a menace.  I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right. These groups are always extreme fringes, and a handful of people make the world a much nastier place.  Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed, using them as pawns in their ambitions of power.  Unfortunately with the world's obsession with free speech and personal liberty, such leaders are given a free hand. On websites like twitter and facebook we see ISIS recruit blind followers. Wouldn't restricting ""free speech"" put brakes on this sort of recruitment ?  Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash, but do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate. I see this as a major flaw in democracy. Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism.  Instead, I think governments should do much more and try to completely stamp out any signs of fascism. After the horrors of World War 2 I find it completely absurd that we still put up with their ideologies.  Bringing socio-economic growth to communities that feel disenfranchised just isn't enough, and their will always be a few bad apples. These bad apples need to be weeded out. Instead, we allow them to spread their rot, and infect society.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Global stability is a myth grown out of a population that has gotten good at balancing acts. The supports necessary for real stability simply don&amp;#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To carry out a balancing act, you have to avoid any extreme reactions, as they only make for larger oscillations. Censorship is an extreme reaction to an extreme force, and here are two very good arguments for why should be seen as an extreme option:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) There are many things we used to consider extreme that are now fundamental principles of our society. We claim that our old positions were wrong, and have good evidence to back this up. With this in mind, we are forced to acknowledge that we are probably making errors in other places, and may even have been led astray in one of the areas we have already changed. Censorship halts this process and locks in whatever is current.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) Censorship does not eliminate the censored individual. Indeed, they will work hard to evade the censor, carrying out their activities further from the public eye. This brings their arguments out of public discourse, where a solid counter-argument is more likely to be interjected. It also dooms any attempt to change their beliefs, as their opponents no longer understand those beliefs sufficiently to do this. Finally it gives them a true claim that they are being oppressed and targeted, which history suggests tends to strengthen a group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The limiting of extremist ideologies may make them more popular. See what happened to death metal. When you tell people things are bad, they will do them/be exposed to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The definition of extremism changes constantly. For example, The Church of Satan is a relatively inocuous group of essentially atheists, and we recognize that now. If someone tried to start that in the 1920s, they&amp;#39;d be swiftly shut the fuck down. The definition of extremism is too fragile and easily changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If someone advocated for gay rights in the 1850s, under your law, they&amp;#39;d probably be &amp;quot;stamped out&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to this point - as you eliminate extremist thoughts, more and more moderate thought begins to be extreme. People will start self-policing their beliefs, and this leads to a loss of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be a tool for censorship. Anything could be called extreme. Christianity? A religion about a man rising from the dead? Sounds like necromancy and death worship to me, ban it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you live in a society that values exchange of ideas, then you should know some skeptical principles. Anything could be correct. You look at ideas based on merit, not on what followers of that idea do. For example, ending Apartheid in South Africa took some violence on behalf of the anti-apartheid groups. Does that mean anti-apartheid, as an idea, was a bad thing? You&amp;#39;re using actions to stamp out ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your post is politically biased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right.

"CMV: Irony aside, most people that post in CMV are uneducated, and changing their view on one point won't solve this overall problem","There are some instances, yes where controversial topics are discussed here and people are actually interested in hearing the opposite side. I consider myself one of those people, and was initially driven to this subreddit in the hope that I would meet other people like myself that were posting here to educate themselves. The type of man that reads a book that argues against a position he already holds, in the hopes that he can understand the entire issue in a great light.  But far and away, this is not the case. Some of the posts on here include logical fallacies even in the titles: yesterday's [atheism post](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rfea1/) used a strawman fallacy in the title to misrepresent their own position to make it easier to defend in a religion vs. athiesm debate. The OP, if you read that post, was by and large not interested in changing his opinion, and this is true of the *vast majority* of posts that come through here.  And the problem is this: it is a tremendous waste of time for every knowledgable person that posts answers in here. A lot of times, the posts are not controversial: they are simply the product of stupidity. There are a thousand places, a million internet hits, which one can browse to discover facts on the athiesm/religion debate and even the specific subtopic that was discussed yesterday. An educated person, or rather, a person seeking to educate himself, would have simply utilized this vast body of resources rather than take time to create a new resource.  Additionally, the people that tend to post in this subreddit post on this subreddit have a certain mindset already, even before submitting. Go ahead, think of something you believe that is controversial and click ""Submit CMV."" Your mind will already be working to inhibit opposing opinions and you will be clinging harder than ever to the bulwarks of your argument. The fact of the matter is this: it takes considerable effort to open one's mind, even on things that are not of great consequence. And most people are simply unable to accomplish this.  Thanks for your replies. I intend to reply to each response to my original post, albeit maybe not today, and I hope to award many deltas for your efforts.  Quick edit: I realized I didn't address the second part of my title claim. Albert Einstein said that 2 things are limitless: the universe and human stupidity. For every stupid person that posts on this sub to address one point of their lack of knowledge, there are foreseeably dozens more points of misunderstanding that remain. What is the overall aim of this subreddit? To educate one at a time, indeed. But on issues that can be solved via Google search or the opening of a book, how can one fill the infinite pit of human stupidity? Only controversial issues, where both opinions are agreed to be at least understandable and held widely by educated people, should be allowed. This is a real debate: anything else is just convincing a stupid person of something that they fail to understand.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It would still be false to say that nobody ever changes their view, though. People have deltas awarded to them, and those signify that somewhere out there, somebodies mind was changed. Maybe it was insignificant, maybe it was only changed for a brief moment before some argument changed it back. Regardless, people do change their views here sometimes, and that&amp;#39;s a result of them taking the time to examine their views in light of others&amp;#39;. I view that as intrinsically good, the search for knowledge and the refinement of your own belief system, these things make you a better, more educated and well-rounded person. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You said it was a waste of time because most people&amp;#39;s views aren&amp;#39;t changed, or aren&amp;#39;t changed enough, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t say that makes it a waste of time. The mere act of getting someone to evaluate their own views and challenge them is a good thing to get in the habit of. You have to start somewhere, so to speak. Even if it&amp;#39;s about the most insignificant of things, or even if they didn&amp;#39;t change their mind at all, it&amp;#39;s still a positive step for that person to try.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Second, it sometimes goes the other way. Just because OP doesn&amp;#39;t change his mind doesn&amp;#39;t mean someone reading the comments hasn&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;ve read several posts where I went in disagreeing with OP, but after reading the arguments in favor of their arguments, I&amp;#39;ve come out with a different point of view. I had no part in the discussion, no comments were made, no deltas awarded, but someone&amp;#39;s view was changed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maybe it feels like slogging through shit sometimes, but if you can get someone to think critically about their own beliefs even for a second, isn&amp;#39;t that a good thing?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV:I feel guilty playing RPGs on ""Casual"" mode","I'm definitely on the older end of the gamer spectrum, and have pretty much experienced the entire history of video games first hand.  Back in the day, a lot of the better RPGs were turn-based, requiring some strategy but little in terms of reaction time.  I just finished playing Dragon Age: Inquisition.  I started it on ""Normal"" but downshifted into ""Casual"" fairly early into it.  I've done the same thing with Mass Effect, Skyrim and others.  I love the stories, but I find the battles tedious.  Now, I know I could go into turn-based mode on many of these, and get through most of the battles most of the time, but it just feels like work and not worth it.  Boss battles seem particularly painful - spending forever endlessly whacking the boss, who then hide so you fight the minions, for the chance to whack the boss again.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  But, still, there's a shame of wussing out.  REAL gamers don't use easy mode (or even ""normal"").  I didn't have to back in my day (of course, back then I had a hell of a lot more time to game).

CMV: Altruism is self-serving.,"This is something I used to go back and forth on with an ex. Someone mentioned altruism in another thread and it made me think of this. Since it's always been a very interesting topic to me, and she never succeeded in changing my view on it, I thought I'd bring it here to discuss.  My view is that all actions are self-serving, and that altruism is no exception. I don't see that as a bad thing, but people who like to think of themselves as altruists seem to get offended by the idea and rail against it.  Self-serving isn't evil.  ""But Zero,"" one might ask, ""how would a soldier throwing himself on a grenade be self-serving?"" Truly that is an altruistic action! It is, and I don't think it's anything less than it is. But that soldier would do so because in so doing they fulfill some moral obligation they hold themselves to. It is in adherence with who they wish to be, and through action serves to make it so.   It also bears noting that this isn't something I assert, necessarily. That is, I don't point it out to people as a counter to their claim of being altruistic. The topic only even came about as a result of discussing the view that all actions are self-serving. ""What about altruistic actions?"" ""Well, yes, those too, in their way.""  Less dire, a person may give to charity or the homeless for a desire to see good done, or because they feel that because they have plenty themselves they should share what they can because they're good people. It's a behavior which serves to maintain their self-image.    _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

However, I just started a job at an anesthesiologist billing office that uses a company in India to do their data entry (a LOT of anesthesiologists use our service so there's a lot of data entry) and it got me thinking that there's nothing actually wrong with outsourcing aside from just the potential poor quality, but my work really benefits from it and they do a good job.   The call centers I used to deal with at the airline would often try to hide the fact that they were outsourced. I don't think there should be a stigma. They provide a service at a lower cost. Why do I deserve a job more than Rahul, Priya, or Mahesh? If a company benefits from it, why not? But is there something I'm not seeing? CMV! I'm totally up for a change let's do it!   Edit: to clarify, I don't mean that I don't find it morally wrong. Morals don't have anything to do with it. I just mean that I don't think that a business owes anything to the country it operates in if that service can be provided elsewhere at a lower cost.   Edit 2: In regards to my original argument that I don't think there should be a stigma my view has changed in the following ways:   1-companies have been known to fire employees in order to outsource their jobs.   2-conditions of the outsourcing company can be very poor and unpredictable.   3-outsourcing takes away many entry level jobs that would help an employee get their foot in the door.   4-companies have been know to use unskilled workers to do skilled work in the name of saving money instead of actually talented skilled people. In other words, they're potentially slowing down technological advances so they can pay less for codes and systems that are bugged and written by people that don't know what they're doing and now they don't work properly.   Again it's not that I find these reasons necessarily wrong from a business standpoint. More from the perspective that I personally either find them shitty or distasteful therefore I can no longer say that I don't think there should be a stigma.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

When poor quality code is found, the individual who wrote it will invariably have been moved on (often because it&amp;#39;s known they write poor code). By that point we have paid the money for the code, and then have to spend twice as much trying to find someone good enough to debug it properly - only half the time we can&amp;#39;t even use them because we only pay the lowest day-rate. Because these roles are so transient no knowledge builds up, nothing is learnt and the same mistakes get made time and time again - even poor developers who we&amp;#39;ve moved off one project will just spring up again on another project of ours.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The culture in India is invariably one of hiding problems from sight. I&amp;#39;m sorry if that seems politically incorrect, but it&amp;#39;s true. I never hear anything from the Indian firms we deal with other than that there are no problems and everything is achievable. Unfortunately 9 times out of 10 my superiors would rather hear their good news than me trying to contradict them, and when it&amp;#39;s left as a pile of crap that needs sorting out then invariably I&amp;#39;m told it&amp;#39;s a &amp;#39;governance&amp;#39; failure by my team. There isn&amp;#39;t even a recognition that these out-sourcing companies make their money by introducing addional work into the system. They are not working for the benefit of my company, they are generating work for themselves for decades to come.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Everyone in India is an &amp;#39;expert&amp;#39;. Java expert, database expert, Testing expert and so on - even the kids straight out of school with zero qualifications are &amp;#39;experts&amp;#39;; this is how they sell themselves to bean-counters in firms like mine. We built one of our systems in-house, yet when we put out to tender for developers one firm claimed to have 27 experts in that very system that they had never seen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We now have the same Indian company doing both our development and testing, and - guess what? The number of defects in the code has plummeted. At least, it has, right up until the point we bring it all back in-house for final user testing, when it&amp;#39;s found to be total crap. We are now utterly shafted by this situation.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Because the code is outsourced then it weakens everyone else in the IT department who needs to know what&amp;#39;s going on. My job is near-impossible these days because I can&amp;#39;t find anyone who can either show me the code or explain how it works, so when I need to set up new projects my estimates become unreliable and my position is considerably weaker. It&amp;#39;s like something out of Kafka - the code that my company owns we can&amp;#39;t see because we have outsourced its ownership to a company so opaque and incompetent that it can&amp;#39;t even find someone who can find the relevant lines of code to show me.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;We have no future pipeline in IT any more, since all the entry-level jobs now sit with another company in India. All the Analysts, Architects, Project Managers, Senior IT Leaders etc who used to emerge from the development teams now don&amp;#39;t come from anywhere, meaning we have an ageing population in most of our remaining in-house IT department. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In all, we have priorised quantity at the expense of quality and are now barely functioning as an IT department any more, and it breaks my heart to see my company spending millions building systems that are so badly written that I know they&amp;#39;ll end up spending an impossible fortune trying to maintain them and build on them in future. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, is it morally wrong to outsource jobs overseas? No. It&amp;#39;s just daft that companies think that handing over the crown jewels of their IT department is a good thing (and believe me, if you&amp;#39;re not in control of your own code then you don&amp;#39;t have a functioning IT department) or that a company would hand over the job of &lt;em&gt;talking to their own customers&lt;/em&gt; to another company. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The old mantra remains true: you gets what you pays for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it depends on the kind of work being outsourced. There are some companies that outsource major programming tasks to teams in India. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a problem because the engineers in the US have no idea of the qualifications of their team in India. They also do not get to select their own team. This means you might end up with a team that is not at all qualified to write good code.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I am not saying that the quality is always bad; but going by several articles online, bad code is &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; common. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And for this reason, it&amp;#39;s a bad idea to outsource some tasks. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the team in the US can get to interview people in India to be on their team, this problem would be solved to quite an extent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"I don't believe wearing a seat-belt in a privately owned vehicle should be enforced by law, CMV","I obviously have a bit of a libertarian streak. Also, it's worth noting that I wear a seatbelt 100% of the time I am in a car, and always have.  That out of the way, I feel that forcing people to engage in an activity which at face value only serves to protect them from themselves is overstepping reasonable government regulation. Adults should be allowed to increase their risk of injury or death so long as it does not increase that risk for any other persons.  I've had talks with people about my take on this IRL and have had some pretty interesting discussions. People generally point to higher road fatalities causing taxpayers money due to costs of first responders as ways in which driving without a seatbelt hurts others, but I personally consider this negligible as there are many small actions  in all facets of life that on aggregate could cost taxpayers money.  I really see no good reason why private individuals should be forced by law to engage in a safety measure which is 99.9% personal safety.  CMV!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not just personal safety, though. It&amp;#39;s also other people&amp;#39;s liability.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Say you don&amp;#39;t wear your seatbelt. What if another car accidentally hits your car from behind. If wearing a seatbelt, you would have survived, but instead you hit the windshield and, with the harsh impact, die. Instead of a smaller insurance issue, it now becomes manslaughter. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s similar to why police (technically are supposed to) enforce jaywalking laws. It makes you a liability to someone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;#39;t think it should be enforced by law, but I think it should be enforced by insurance premiums.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t wear your seat-belt, it increases the likelihood that you&amp;#39;ll get seriously injured in a car crash. Therefore, insurance companies should be able to charge more for people who don&amp;#39;t wear there seatbelts. They could even have a clause that says something along the lines of &amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re not wearing your seatbelt during an accident, we will not be able to reimburse you for all damages...&amp;quot; etc.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, Government really isn&amp;#39;t necessary, but a free-market in insurance premiums is.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not sure if that&amp;#39;ll change your view, but it&amp;#39;s another way to challenge this argument.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"CMV: As an environmental engineer, I give up! PLEASE CMV!","Greetings  I am an environmental engineer, with a degree in environment and land management. I have studied and dedicated my professional life to make a change on our world, to make this planet a better place for future generations and protect it from those that would exploit it for greed and short term gain.  After 15 years of working in the field I am ready to give up. The fact is most people don't give a shit about our planet and the legacy we are leaving for future generations. I have worked hard, sometimes more than 70 hours a week, to see all that I have accomplished destroyed by short sighted corporations and the uncaring government that work for them.  I have been called a useless hippy who works only to stifle profits, I have seen the depths of which government and corporations will go to fuck us all for short term gains and I have lived for many years barely breaking even and financially keeping myself afloat because most environmental jobs that aren't about exploiting the system to maximize a companies profits pays for shit.  Well now I have a wife, a son, banks who are hounding me night and day to pay back my student loans and the dream of offering a better life for my family. This week I have been offered two new career opportunity. One is to manage a non profit organisation dedicated to protecting the last vestiges of forests and wetlands around the city i live in (while paying only 13$/h). The other is for a big construction company, to make sure that it is compliant with the pathetic environmental regulations while it bulldozes over the last natural ecosystems we have (but for more money per month than I ever made in a year)  I am to give my decision next week and I am truly considering for the first time in my life to give up my principals and go work for the money. I need somebody to change my views, but I am so tired of living poor, of not being respected and of seeing all my work be for nothing.  Edit: Wow I am getting finger cramps from replying to all of these great posts (very few of them were not so great ... you know who you are!) I sincerely thank you all for contributing to this great discussion. I have made this post as a whimsical experiment... I have already discussed about my career choice with my wife and close family and I have already come to a decision considering what to do with my immediate future. I just wanted to anonymously find out what the reddit community thought about my hard decision and I have been more than happily suprised with the response. This is the essence of what makes reddit so great... Many thanks to all of you... I will continue to respond to as many comments as I can and tomorrow I will update this post with my final decision and the reasons why I chose it.     Final decision Edit: First I would like to thank you all for this awesome CMV. It went way beyond what I had ever expected and I don't think I have ever spent so much time typing since my time at university. Like I said in the previous edit, I had already reached a decision by consulting my wife, my friends and my family, but all the incredible advice and the insightful comment gave me great hope that my decision will be the right one for my career, myself and my family. So here it goes  I have decided to take the construction industry job for the following reasons:  - Right now it is an awful time to be working in the non-profit NGO, where I live. The conservative government has slashed all funding in the environment sector and the provincial government only cares about austerity. If I took the NGO job, I wouldn't even be guarantied to be able to keep it for very long if the meager funding dries out.  - I have been working in the same field, with the same people for over 15 years. I am feel enthusiastic about learning new things and working with new people. Also if I learn the inner workings of the construction industry, I may become much more efficient to enact long term meaningful changes.  - I have been living poor (well much more then most engineer do) for the past 15 and I still have some student loans to reimburse. Banks have constantly been picking at my heels and it will be quite a load of my stress, if I can finally repay then and make then STFU! Also having some form of financial stability would be great for a change.  - Although where I live, our society has quite the safety net and I am assured that my child will never lack of his basic needs whatever salary I make, It would be great to offer my family a better quality of life. Rest assured I am not someone who will have more money go to his head. By nature, I am not a great consumer and I am very likely to put most of my money aside for personal projects and even help out the NGO I had worked for and respect.  - I have dedicated my entire life to fight for the environment and that in not about to change, even if I work in a different field. Over the years I have found that enacting change from the outside of a system is next to impossible, so it will be quite interesting to see if change can be had from the inside.   - My greatest fear is that the construction job asks me to compromise to much on my value and that makes me fall into a depression. In order to prevent this scenario, I will be following the advice given by many of you. Quickly put money aside, so I can safely bail out if thing get to rough and have multiple contingency plan if ever it does.   - Finally I must admit that the money does sound attractive. I never had a job that pays so much and I never thought I would. However having grown in a wealthy (relatively speaking) family, I know first hand that money doesn't buy happiness, it just makes misery very comfortable. Since I am a woodsman and love working outdoors comforts aren't that important to me, but it's been forever since I have dreamed of visiting the different forests around the world and for the first time in my life, I may actually be able to do that (If I ever get some vacation time... a concept that is equally alien to me)   Once again many thanks to all the people who commented on my CMV post (yes even the trolls, their idiotic antics proved somewhat entertaining) I wish you all the very best of luck in your endeavours and if anyone wants to help me in my quest to make this world a better place, feel free to go out an plant a tree. In the long run it does actually make a difference. Ardaron9 out!         Tldr: CMV really worked and I no longer believe that going to work for a big construction company is a huge betrayal of my environmental values. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I believe we put too much emphasis on science and engineering studies.CMV.,"I believe this, because I think human lives improved the most through social and economical revolutions and believe they will keep improving through social and economical changes.  Glad to hear your opinions  Edit: Thank you all for such an interest discussion.  Let me clarify my stance on this subject: Study biochemistry, but I find we tend to belittle the capacity of students in other fields to contribute to society (or ""the economy""). As much as it's true that science is the most constant and measurable way for society to grow, we put to much emphasis on these subjects instead of seeing the ""big picture"" and understanding that one great author may influence the lives of millions and completely change the way we live (for good or bad, think about how much influence Marx had on the world).","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe this, because I think human lives improved the most through social and economical revolutions and believe they will keep improving through social and economical changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These social changes wouldn&amp;#39;t have been possible without the technical advances.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Changes in the 1950s-60s were only possible due to television, radio, telephones, and transit (&lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281955%E2%80%931968%29#Freedom_Rides.2C_1961""&gt;Freedom Rides, among many others&lt;/a&gt;). The recent uproar in North Africa was possible due to the internet, social media, television, and cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not to discount the need for artistic expression, more liberal studies, a focus on the humanities, etc., but I think this should include a firm grasp of mathematics, technology, engineering, physics, etc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that the only emphasis on science and engineering that is excessive is that of the STEM education path. Profit to promote science can be quite beneficial, but pursuing science and using the resources solely for profit can be reckless.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you want an example of scientific advancement which had an incredible effect on the world, look no further than &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug""&gt;Norman Borlaug&lt;/a&gt; whose research resulted in avoiding world hunger. I would grant that the social change of wealth and high quality of life typically yields a slowing of population growth which assists in making these advances sustainable. At the same time, that is one of the beautiful parts of science where it works well in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Economical changes? Here&amp;#39;s a thought for you. The internet is a prime example of what has come from technological advancement. Without focus on the sciences, this tool would not be available to spread the knowledge and resources which drive social change. The revolution in Tunisia which kicked off the Arab Spring is heavily connected to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What I say here is that if you seek social and economic advancement, those changes almost always rely heavily upon scientific advancement to be effective or even viable. Science and engineering are important foundations for the social and economic structures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"CMV:As a black person, I feel I must tip nearly 40% to make up for the multitude of other black people who don't tip.","To start off, I am a black woman and I grew up poor. My mother took my siblings and I out only on Saturdays for fun. She would save up her money and take us downtown to the local mall for a treat and maybe a toy. We didn't have much and lived on the third floor of an apartment that we later learned was the local drug house. Even though for us going out for a meal was extremely rare, she instilled in us that you were supposed to tip when you got good service. She told us that you never go out to eat if you couldn't tip; you went to McDonalds or Burger King. She taught us that the people serving you are to be respected for doing their job as it often isn't pleasant. For us, there was no ""running"" a server or just being overly difficult for no reason. Go in, eat your meal, be respectful and tip for good service. Today I am an adult and it pains me to hear that so many black people either don't understand tipping or simply choose not to. So I feel obligated to make up for them by massively over tipping I guess. Please tell me that I shouldn't do this, I feel responsible for the actions of other adults who should know better but for some reason don't. Thanks :)  _____ **Edit**:Hi everyone, after sleeping on this issue and listening to many of the comments, my opinion has been changed. I realize that I am not responsible for the actions of other people, only my own.

"CMV: A group home may be opening near me, and I'm afraid that is will be bad for the neighborhood","People in my neighborhood just got notified that a house recently sold to a corporation and they have the intention of turning it into a ""group home"". We went to a meeting last night to get some details on exactly what that means, and I'm worried that it is going to be very bad for the neighborhood.  My concerns are:  1. The company may potentially be moving ""dangerous"" people into the house. I live in a very quiet residential neighborhood, and the thought of drug addicts being housed near me is disturbing. Even if the residents are well behaved, there is going to be traffic of their ""friends"" who I'm assuming will be similar in nature. The company won't say who may be living there. It could be just infirm elderly people, but it could also be ""sexual predators"" for all I know.   2. My house will lose value when people find out that it is near a group home. Even if it isn't logical, I'm assuming that when someone is looking to buy my house they will be put off by the presence of group home nearby.   3. The business buying the house is a tax-free organization. I don't exactly know what that means, but I assume that they won't be paying property taxes. That means that they will be consuming resources but not paying for them, and my share of the community taxes will increase.  4. Even if this particular place only houses people who are complete angels, this will set a precedent and open up the neighborhood for other homes, and there is no guarantee that the other homes will be run as well.   So, that's it. I'd love to hear from someone with experience with group homes moving nearby to tell me that all of my concerns are invalid.   And, in truth my **real** view is that I *don't know* if my uninformed opinions are correct or not, so if you happen to be able to **confirm** my thoughts I'd consider that to be changing my view as well. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that group homes can do a lot of good for a lot of people.  Rehabilitation should be our ultimate goal for them, and they&amp;#39;ve got to live somewhere.  It&amp;#39;s quite possible that they would be so well behaved that no one would ever know they were there.  Having said all of that, I wouldn&amp;#39;t want a group home built in my neighborhood either.  It&amp;#39;s really a gamble, and it isn&amp;#39;t a gamble I would willingly accept.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I can only address your first two concerns, as I do not know what type of an impact this could have on property taxes or what effect this &amp;quot;precedent&amp;quot; would have.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;I would worry about dangerous people as well.  If they aren&amp;#39;t dangerous, they may run in circles with those who are.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;I definitely would not buy a home in the neighborhood with this.  Would you have purchased your home if the group home had already been there?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You never know what you&amp;#39;re getting with any new neighbor, but this is a bigger risk than your average neighbor.  I would be concerned as well for my safety, my property, and the value of my property.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m your guy for this one.  I worked at a group home for 14 years and now work in real estate.   Odds are the group home is for adults with special needs and developmental disabilities.   That&amp;#39;s the majority of group home residents.  Assuming most group homes are like the one I worked at these won&amp;#39;t be violent (at least not chronically) people.  If they are they&amp;#39;d be placed in a mental health facility.   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is the possibility some may be sex offenders.  Because of the huge liability my state paid for a one-to-one staff for residents with a history of that.  In other words we had full time (24/7) staff whose sole job was to monitor these people.  Even then they were not often allowed in the community.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For property value concerns, I don&amp;#39;t think it would effect you much.  Buyers are not allowed to ask about the specific kind of people who make up a neighborhood and agents can&amp;#39;t answer those questions.   People with mental disorders are a protected class and we can&amp;#39;t steer people toward or away from a neighborhood for that reason.  On top of that agents don&amp;#39;t have information concerning these homes, just as your information is limited.  It&amp;#39;s a Right to Privacy issue.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Right now I think you don&amp;#39;t have anything to worry about.  Once they move in I&amp;#39;m betting you won&amp;#39;t notice a thing has changed in your neighborhood. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I can't see any logic in the anarchist ideology. Educate me and CMV,"I've got to be honest, I know nothing about the anarchist movement and everything i've seen on Reddit has made me think less of them.  I went over to /r/Anarchism and /r/anarchy101 and didn't find anything more thought provoking.  First of all what is so wrong with the state that is needs to be abolished.  I don't like it the way it is either but I think it just needs tweaking.  Secondly I don't see how you can't have anyone in charge.  Either you have the system we have now of representative leadership, you have direct democracy or you have a power vacuum.  If you have a power vacuum how do you stop the person with the most guns taking over?  I have other issues but those two are the biggest.  What are the advantages of anarchism over our current system and how will you anarchism stop itself being run by war lords.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t speak for &lt;a href=""/r/anarchism""&gt;/r/anarchism&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""/r/anarchy101""&gt;/r/anarchy101&lt;/a&gt;, and in fact, I know at least one Anarchy-related subreddit actually had a problem with mods abusing their power, which I find absolutely hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But if you want a look at how one form of anarchy might work, in comic form, I highly recommend &lt;a href=""http://www.bigheadpress.com/eft?page=1""&gt;Escape From Terra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the gist of it, as I understand:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;First of all what is so wrong with the state that is needs to be abolished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Power corrupts, and bureaucracy can be even worse. Yes, it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be fixed with &amp;quot;a little tweaking&amp;quot;, but those in power have an incentive to tweak it in their favor, not in yours. Democracy helps, but can you point to a democracy today that&amp;#39;s truly serving its citizens well?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Secondly I don&amp;#39;t see how you can&amp;#39;t have anyone in charge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;See the comic. Essentially:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have a power vacuum how do you stop the person with the most guns taking over?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is one problem I have with anarchy. Another problem is that to get from here to there, as with Libertarianism, requires weakening the state, and the corporations are right there to fill that power vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But suppose, as with the comic, we escaped from this planet and went somewhere that a few of us could make our own rules, and be self-sufficient by the time the state came after us. Could it work? I&amp;#39;m skeptical, but playing devil&amp;#39;s advocate, here&amp;#39;s what I tihnk the argument is:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How does representative democracy work? I think it&amp;#39;s equal parts agreement and implicit threat. Agreement as in, we all agree that democracy is the best system of government we&amp;#39;ve got (even if it&amp;#39;s still pretty bad), so we agree to participate in government to some degree (voting) and to abide by the government&amp;#39;s rules. Implicit threat as in, if I actually wanted to dismantle the government, well, the government is currently the person with the most guns.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anarchy would essentially work the same way, but with these two things combined. Agreement: When everyone is brought up to believe that individual freedom is incredibly important, and that anything resembling an actual state or hierarchy will inevitably lead to Very Bad Things, then &lt;a href=""http://www.bigheadpress.com/eft?page=965""&gt;when someone tries to seize power&lt;/a&gt;, the general population &lt;a href=""http://www.bigheadpress.com/eft?page=988""&gt;simply won&amp;#39;t allow it&lt;/a&gt;. That ties into the implicit threat -- when &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; knows that they&amp;#39;ve got a duty to preserve this true anarchy, then everyone owns a gun. Being the person with the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; guns just means you&amp;#39;ll be the most dead when you try to use them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can understand how it might be difficult for you to envision anarchy at a national/state level.  There are possibly two reasons for this.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One, you mistakenly conflate anarchy with &amp;quot;no rule&amp;quot;.  Anarchy is not a lack of government, per se.  It is against hierarchy, where some people higher up rule those further down.  This does not preclude the existence of rules and regulations, it simply means that they are developed by, and voted on, by everyone they will apply to.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anarchists have ways of making decisions and maintaining rules for a group.  One example is the consensus process of making decisions.  Short, basic version is, people discuss and ultimately vote on topics.  Some form of majority rules, but any individual can put a stop to a decision by &amp;quot;blocking&amp;quot; it, which is to make a statement that you feel so strongly about this decision that you&amp;#39;d leave the group if it proceeds.  Your concerns are talked out, the proposal is possibly modified, or it stays the same and you have to either live by the group&amp;#39;s consensus, or choose not to and leave.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Contrast that with most systems of law today.  You don&amp;#39;t get to &amp;quot;choose not to&amp;quot;.  Anarchy does not mean there are no rules or governance.  It&amp;#39;s there, it&amp;#39;s just different.  Rather than law being imposed upon people from &amp;quot;above&amp;quot;, it is applied by the people to themselves.  Power is horizontal and not vertical.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The second misconception here is that of scale.  Your prompt implies that you are envisioning anarchy at a &amp;quot;state&amp;quot; level, on a national scale.  This may well be infeasible, but this isn&amp;#39;t the only level at which anarchy can exist.  Many organizations, especially alternative or activist ones, are governed in an anarchist fashion, often utilizing some form of the consensus decision making process.  Occupy, notably, governed themselves this way.  Say what you want about the movement as a whole, but the camp sites routinely had organization, security, food (often free), port-a-pots and other sanitation facilities, and sometimes even recycling, compost, trash services, libraries... all functioning well with anarchist &amp;quot;leadership&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not only feasible on a smaller scale, it&amp;#39;s quite effective.  Anarchy, in theory and in practice, gives a voice to every individual, empowers everyone, involves each member in the process of governing and being governed.  If these are things that are important to you, or if you just want shared ownership of something, or want to run something in a way that no individual can take too much power or leadership, or so on and so forth, anarchist governance might look like an attractive option.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Can war lords emerge and rule everyone?  Well, sure, just like in our current society, anyone who can wield sufficient violence can rule.  However, you may have overlooked that there&amp;#39;s nothing that prevents anarchist collectives from forming a security force of their own.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You may ask by this point, &amp;quot;Aren&amp;#39;t these anarchists then just replicating all the existing functions of the state?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#39;d say yes.  There&amp;#39;s nothing about anarchism, fundamentally, that means that many if not most functions of the state can&amp;#39;t be replicated by that model.  The difference is, in the systems of representative democracy that characterize most &amp;quot;democratic&amp;quot; states, decision making, lawmaking, law enforcement, and general ruling is being done by an elite group of ruling individuals, whether they&amp;#39;ve taken power, been appointed it, voted in, or what have you.  There is a hierarchy.  Rule is imposed upon those further down, even when those ruled didn&amp;#39;t have a say in the rules.  Contrast that with a system in which people can directly involve themselves in every decision.  People have a direct say in the formation of the rules by which they are governed, and the capacity to walk away from a group whose rules they didn&amp;#39;t agree with.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, tl;dr:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; Anarchy doesn&amp;#39;t mean no rules&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Anarchy doesn&amp;#39;t have to be at a &amp;quot;state&amp;quot; level, it can be smaller in scale&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Anarchy is on a spectrum.  There is no &amp;quot;pure&amp;quot; anarchy, there&amp;#39;s stuff closer to that side than the other, and a lot in between.  Even if you might still not see the logic in &amp;quot;complete&amp;quot; anarchy, you might still want to consider the merit of some steps in that direction.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I wrote a thesis on the Occupy movement, so if you want to know more of the nitty gritty details about how exactly anarchism functions in practice, and even the divides between different types of anarchists within the camp and how they were resolved and other sort of telling stuff like that, let me know, I&amp;#39;m very familiar with at least this example.  (Really shines light on the &amp;quot;spectrum&amp;quot; thing.) I&amp;#39;ve personally seen anarchism work as a method for governing a group of people, and can provide examples of other anarchist groups, so we do know that it does, in real life, work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: I think that whoever has an addiction is weak and deserves whatever happens to him,"I don't really like this aspect of myself. I was reading through [this post about eating disorders](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/22nntb/vent_i_miss_overeating/cgorfb1) and I found myself thinking  &gt;""They're complaining that people who are addicted to drugs are treated better than fat people who are addicted to food. I don't care, they're all hopeless addicts. Wow I'm an awful person""  But I couldn't really think of a counter argument that could make me 'like' these people.   Just to make it clear, I think that people who try to get help and go to rehab (or gym, or similar) are doing a good thing for themselves, but until they actually prove they changed their habits I would still look down to them.  The main point is probably that you cannot not know what was coming at you, and you decided to do it anyway, you DECIDED to get addicted.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have an addictive personality and I find it incredibly easy not to overdo things because i don&amp;#39;t want to.  Am I strong because of this, or just lucky?  I would say lucky.   This probably isn&amp;#39;t the argument you were looking for, but when you look at the world through the lens that free will is not a thing, saying people deserve something makes no sense.  People are a product of their genetics and environment, both of which they have no control over.                                                                I remember watching an episode of house where one of his patients was disowned by her family for being a drug addict, but they found later that it wasn&amp;#39;t her fault, but rather she had a brain tumor on the part of her brain that controlled addiction.  How come in this instance, it is not her fault, but if her brain acts in the same way as the tumor is causing, without the tumor, it IS her fault.  It seems reasonable to me that one day we will be able to give people a pill to cure their addiction and make their brains work like yours and mine.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you&amp;#39;re deriving self-esteem from the fact that you aren&amp;#39;t addicted to anything. Like your whole life has been opportunity after opportunity to get addicted to things, but you&amp;#39;ve been mentally and morally strong enough to resist, unlike these fatties and junkies you see on TV. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reality is that some people are genetically predisposed for addiction. Some people experience shit so horrible that they feel like the only thing that can make them feel ok is an addictive substance. Some people have been made to think so little of themselves that they deserve addiction. Some people had upbringings that made it impossible for them to consider the consequences of their behavior. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The fact that you&amp;#39;re not an addict doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you&amp;#39;re better than anyone, it just means you&amp;#39;re luckier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: Beauty and the Beast is NOT one of the greatest Disney movies.,"It has come to my attention that if you talk to any movie buff about greatest Disney movies made, Beauty and the Beast always - somehow - weasels itself into their lists. I'm not going to say the movie's awful, because it's not. I'm not even going to say it's bad. And while I did enjoy this movie, I never thought it was something great or revolutionary.   For the sake of argument, I'll list my problems with it:  1. Belle.  I find her to be void of personality whatsoever. She's very 2D like the old princesses such as Snow White or Aurora. And she's also somewhat of a Mary Sue. What is the likely hood that the prettiest girl in all of the town is also the most well-read, articulate, modest, selfless and non judgemental? She's too perfect of a character for me, with her only negative counterparts being that she is some of those descriptions to a fault.   - The love story.  Beast is an ACTUAL Beast. He's not just beastly/ very hard on the eyes, he's an actual monster/animal looking thing. He's not human. Like, at all. Belle has no way of knowing that he was once a human and cursed into being a beast. Sure, she goes into that one wing of the castle and sees a picture of the human him on the wall, but if you're telling me that she pieced everything together after that, you're lying to yourself as well. She willingly fell in love with an animal. In a romantic way. Not to mention the fact that he kidnapped her and she fell in love with him, which I think is commonly referred to as Stockholm Syndrome, but idk.   - Gaston's death.  Why? Why kill him? Because he tried to kill the beast? In Gaston's defence, the Beast is almost the same character, but with a second chance at redemption. To me killing Gaston was the easy way of just burying that story. We're supposed to hate Gaston and love the Beast but they're just too similar that I can't have such opposing views on them. At least Gaston was humorous and got a song.   - Human Beast (appearance wise)  No.  - Timing/ pacing  There actually seemed to be a very minimal time that went past in this movie. There was hardly any interaction between the two, thus making me feel as though the love between them didn't exist at all.   - The initial conflict.   I don't have too big of a problem with this, but his consequences for being a dick don't seem to fit. He gets turned into a beast, which sounds about right, but where my problem lies is where he can't be turned back into a human unless he learns to love another and be loved by another. This, on paper, seems fine, but at the end of the day, he falls in love with the prettiest girl in town. How does that prove anything? I know it's Disney and the possibility of an ugly female love-interest doesn't exist, but it seems a little counter productive to have the man who judges people off of how they look to fall in love with the prettiest girl.   /rant  It should be noted again that I don't hate this movie, I rather enjoy it. But there are far better Disney movies out there.  It should also be noted that while I find most of the songs in this movie to be forgettable as hell (how many are there? 3?), I rather enjoy the scene of Tale As Old As Time/ Beauty and the Beast.

What is the likely hood that the prettiest girl in all of the town is also the most well-read, articulate, modest, selfless and non judgemental? She&amp;#39;s too perfect of a character for me&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The main reason why Mary Sue is a negative archetype, is not because people hate perfect characters. There are plenty of idealistic paragorn heroes, wish fulfillment audience avatars, or abstract representations of perfection, that are fun to watch/read about.  Mary Sue refers to how bad artists tend to write characters that are &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; in a specific predictable, unappealing way, pandering to the writer&amp;#39;s transparent desires. Like a fanfic character who bangs all the characters that the writer has the hots for, or an exotic character who reeks of a teenage girl&amp;#39;s laughable expectations of what is &amp;quot;exotic&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Belle&amp;#39;s character is basically a geek. Her not being understood by the common villagers, caring more about books than shallow socializing, yet dreaming of grand adventure, appeals to many audience members, redditors being one such demographic. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;he kidnapped her and she fell in love with him, which I think is commonly referred to as Stockholm Syndrome, but idk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No, it isn&amp;#39;t. Stockholm Syndrome refers specifically to the way prisoners can start to identify their oppresed status as &amp;quot;norrmal&amp;quot;, and believe that every act of decency from their captor is a special kindness, and start getting attracted to that &amp;quot;human side&amp;quot;. This is something that very explicitly &lt;strong&gt;didn&amp;#39;t&lt;/strong&gt; happen in Beauty and the Beast. Belle tried to escape from the Beast, and even afterwards, never put up with him acting violent or hostile.  The whole story was about the Beast learning to change and be a good person who is worthy of Belle, and &lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt; Belle fell in love with him, not about Belle tolerating his hostile attitude yet falling in love with him in spite of it because &amp;quot;he has a good side hidden deep inside&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There actually seemed to be a very minimal time that went past in this movie. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first act was clearly take place during Fall judging by the leaves, there was a snowball fight in the middle, and a spring cleanup, then the villagers&amp;#39; march in a rain. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the same time, if you keep track of the plot point, it&amp;#39;s also clear that the plot took 3 days. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s clearly meant to be abstract, on one hand to provide the feeling that a long time has passed, yet keeping the traditional 3 plot that also appeared in many stories from theatre plays, to many other Disney features. (Aladdin, Frozen, Hunchback of Notre Dame, Tangled, all take place through 3 days, not counting backstory expositions).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;How does that prove anything? I know it&amp;#39;s Disney and the possibility of an ugly female love-interest doesn&amp;#39;t exist, but it seems a little counter productive to have the man who judges people off of how they look to fall in love with the prettiest girl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The which was never supposed to be helpful, she turned all the servants into objects too, she was more of a malicious trickster than a force of good.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that while I find most of the songs in this movie to be forgettable as hell (how many are there? 3?)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Belle&amp;quot; (Little Town)/the &amp;quot;I Want&amp;quot; song. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Gaston&amp;quot;/ the villain song&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Be Our Guest&amp;quot;/ the dinner song&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Something there&amp;quot;/the love song&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Human Again&amp;quot;/ the one from the DVD version&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Beauty and the Beast&amp;quot;/ the central song&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Kill the Beast&amp;quot;/ The Mob Song&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, obviously preferences in movies are individualistic, but I&amp;#39;m a huge Disney/Pixar fan and &amp;quot;Beauty and the Beast&amp;quot; is my all-time favorite movie from the canon.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I find the soundtrack to be beautiful and haunting, particularly the repeating refrain that plays during the introduction and throughout the film.  I think that alone is one of the prettiest pieces of Disney music, never mind the clever and amusing &amp;quot;Gaston&amp;quot; song, &amp;quot;Belle&amp;quot; (which is one of the most succinct and charming introductions to a Disney character, as well as the French setting of the film), plus classics like &amp;quot;Be Our Guest&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Tale as Old As Time&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Belle is my favorite Disney princess - I didn&amp;#39;t find her boring and overly perfect at all.  Instead, she has a burning passion for literature, something many geeky fans can identify with, and her love of books often leads to her to behave in a socially oblivious, clumsy, or goofy manner.  She is fiery and speaks her mind, sassing the Beast even right after he saves her because he frightened her into running away in the first place.  She takes control while binding up his wounds, showing her practicality and assertiveness.  She is extremely curious and deliberately disobeys the Beast, giving the slip to the household accoutrements to sneak off to the West Wing.  None of the those characteristics are the boring, obedient, compliant traits of a Mary Sue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I also think that the human version of the Beast is the handsomest of all the Disney princes, but again that&amp;#39;s a matter of personal preference.  I happen to like blue eyes, unusual features, and Raphael-esque, Renaissance styling.  I find him more beautiful and interesting than the more typical features of, say, Prince Phillip or Eric.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You may be right that Gaston deserves redemption as much as the Beast, but Gaston basically kills himself by horsing around on a high place (chasing after the Beast to stab him).  This is the same way most Disney villains die - their demise is their own fault as they pursue their evil aims at a dangerous height (like in Tarzan, Up, The Incredibles, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Plus you have to take into account the nostalgia of people who are now 30 and saw Beauty and the Beast in their formative years.  It was my template for romance from an early age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I probably can&amp;#39;t convince you it&amp;#39;s a masterpiece, but hopefully you can see the value to other people, even if you don&amp;#39;t feel it yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0

Sure he offered the streak to others (kurt angle for example) but brock was simply the wrong guy.   VIEW CHANGED  jayman419 changed my view.    &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If the gimmick doesn&amp;#39;t work, or they get injured, or (as has been more common in the PG era) get a little popular and split for Hollywood, then you wasted the streak for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting it on a current &amp;quot;main-eventer&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;: You still run the risk of injury (e.g. Edge), and you pretty much lock them in as a perma-heel. The only ones who could&amp;#39;ve handled that convincingly are the &amp;quot;fan-favorites&amp;quot; who are so over, they transcend heel/face casting, and at the time, there were only two people who fit that bill: CM Punk, &lt;em&gt;and The Undertaker&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting it on a big name&lt;/strong&gt;: This is what they actually did, put it on a &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;, as a one off, huge match. It gives Taker an exit if he can&amp;#39;t compete for a year or so (I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;ll have at least one more WM match), gives you built in heat on whoever you put it on (i.e. years from now Brock: &amp;quot;Oh yeah, remember that time I broke the streak), and sets up a great &amp;quot;white knight&amp;quot; feud with someone (&amp;quot;you broke the streak, now I&amp;#39;m gonna break you&amp;quot;, etc). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;#39;t like the fact that they used Brock, I have no problem with them doing it the way they did. Personally, I&amp;#39;d have loved to see Kane take the streak if they were going to give it to a part-timer. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My &amp;quot;dream match&amp;quot; would&amp;#39;ve been having &lt;del&gt;Husky Harris&lt;/del&gt; Bray Wyatt take it, helping to put over the &amp;quot;Undertaker: The Next Generation&amp;quot; gimmick he&amp;#39;s got going on.   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to look at it. I don&amp;#39;t really have a preference, since I haven&amp;#39;t followed recent events or storylines very closely.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One, Undertaker&amp;#39;s concussion was pretty bad, and after Lesner dropped him the final time, Taker had his bell rung a bit and &lt;a href=""http://www.examiner.com/article/wwe-rumors-undertaker-legitimately-hurt-by-brock-lesnar-at-wrestlemania-30""&gt;legit couldn&amp;#39;t kick out&lt;/a&gt;. He struggled to get up (no one came to help them because he&amp;#39;s known to fell it), except it wasn&amp;#39;t him &amp;#39;selling&amp;#39; anything... He simply couldn&amp;#39;t continue, it took all of his strength just to get backstage before he collapsed and was taken to the hospital for the night.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pre-show betting, especially &lt;a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2014/04/07/gamblers-knew-the-undertaker-would-lose-at-wrestlemania-30/""&gt;in the final hour before the match&lt;/a&gt;, seemed to indicate this might not be true.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another way to look at it... WWE decided that no one in their current (full-time) stable was worth that kind of bump. They have some people who fans will turn out to see in PPVs whether they&amp;#39;d recently ended the Undertaker&amp;#39;s streak or not. Instead, this was simply looked at as a business deal... where could this result get the most bang for their buck. Well, they had a lot of money invested in Lesner, knowing full well that he was part time, but &lt;a href=""http://www.cagesideseats.com/2014/4/7/5589054/did-brock-lesnar-deserve-to-be-the-man-to-break-the-undertakers-streak""&gt;that investment wasn&amp;#39;t paying off with his PPV appearances&lt;/a&gt;, so they decided he was the best man for the job.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And yet another way to look at it... &lt;a href=""http://www.cagesideseats.com/2014/4/7/5591754/undertaker-handpicked-brock-lesnar-to-end-the-streak-at-wrestlemania-30""&gt;Undertaker handpicked Lesner&lt;/a&gt;. He knows his career is waning. He hasn&amp;#39;t been much of a full-timer himself recently. (And that&amp;#39;s no knock.. he&amp;#39;s already long since put in the work, so he&amp;#39;s earned it.) When it came time for him to pick someone to end his streak, he decided that a legitimate fighter, with the cache of having won the MMA World Championship previously in his career, was the man he wanted to go out to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"I believe that, in the Bible, Satan is a more moral character than God. CMV","Background: I am an atheist and largely consider the Bible a work of historical fiction and mythology, not fact. It is through this analytical lens I am considering this position. This mostly discusses the Old Testament.  I believe that God is more evil than Satan, and that when God or any of his prophets describe himself as ""loving"" or ""good"", or describes Satan as ""evil"", he is simply lying.  It's difficult to find actual examples in the Bible of Satan acting evil, and it seems that nearly every instance which could be described as ""evil"", is more often better described as ""against God"". If God is a character of pure good, then this would be evil, but if actions speak louder than words, there's very little evidence of God being good.  * He's incredibly jealous, and regularly kills followers of other gods.  * He killed who-knows-how-many people with the Flood.  * He once killed 40 kids for calling a guy bald.  * He wants his followers to be willing to kill their own children because he said so. (Sure, he stopped it, but what was this ""test"" supposed to prove?)  * He seems to be totally okay with rape.  Probably a number of more examples that don't come to mind just now. /r/atheism can certainly provide pages and pages. [Here's](http://www.rationalresponders.com/forum/3582) a link with a list and citations.  What has Satan actually done? Sure, he's regularly described as evil, but what evil acts does he actually commit? He got Adam &amp; Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which is one of those things that falls under the ""against god"" category; I think that knowledge of good and evil is a pretty good thing. He killed Job's family, *with God's complete approval*.  So, have I missed something? Is Satan really evil?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I disagree with you because the old testament doesn&amp;#39;t make a consistent portrayal of the personalities of either Satan or God, or even whether or not they actually have anthropomorphic personalities at all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Satan is not necessarily &amp;quot;against God&amp;quot;.  The identity of Satan, or the Devil is largely inconsistent throughout the old testament because the old testament covers a long stretch of history, and includes many different cultures, all with their own perceptions of good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll find that in the book of Job, Satan is one of God&amp;#39;s lackeys who is given the task of testing God&amp;#39;s subjects.  He&amp;#39;s actually on God&amp;#39;s side.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other cases &amp;quot;Satan&amp;quot; can be understood to mean the evil within humankind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In still other cases, Satan is associated with other names like Lucifer, Beelzebub and Baal, who each have their own cultural associations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The same can be said of God who ranges from being an unseen, unknowable force, to that of a physical dude who would literally come into the street and get into fist fights with unfortunate opponents.  He goes by many different names, each having a different cultural significance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The old testament is best understood, as you say, as a document that evolved as it was passed between cultures over time.  I don&amp;#39;t think it paints a picture that is coherent enough to judge the character of the personalities you&amp;#39;re describing, or even if they should be understood as personalities at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that this is placing your motives onto that of Satan. He is described in the Bible as acting out of malice and hatred of mankind. Some good reading material if you want to understand the Christian view point of Satan is Paradise Lost. He acts out of jealousy, malice and hopes that he may destroy all that God loves. When he gets Eve to eat the apples (though Satan isn&amp;#39;t even mentioned in Genesis but as we are going to speak from an area that you are mostly ignorant except for the selective areas that support your opinion and yet have formed a decisive opinion) it is not because he wishes her to receive greater knowledge of science and logic or whatever. It is because he is envious of the paradise they have been granted when compared to his residence in hell. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If we take moral judgement to be based on intention, not on outcome (see Kant and the Categorical imperative), then, as Satan&amp;#39;s intention is the will to destroy which fails miserably under the Universality Principle (if all were to follow the same goal the outcome would be bad), we must judge him to be immoral. Admittedly God works for the &amp;#39;greater good&amp;#39; which is also un-grounded under the Catergorical Imperative he has also performed redeemable actions (heeling the sick, raising the dead, feeding the hungry, freeing people from slavery, providing water to those without, saving the Jews from persecution, creating a paradise, sacrificing his son to redeem mankind) which place him in a much more preferable place than Satan. Though arguably none of this stuff actually happened this also applies to your argument. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV:Richard Martinez, the father of recent shooting victim is a tool.","Okay, so I feel terrible hearing about the horror and atrocity recently carried out by the psycho virgin in Santa Barbara. That is first and foremost and my views about the father's rants don't change that.     But here's the thing... Within hours of learning that his child had been murdered, Richard Martinez was holding a press conference and calling for more gun control. He has not stopped yet and keeps ranting about how poor gun control led to this killing.     I feel bad for him for his loss, but he hasn't shown any real sadness himself; just a lot of political pandering to push a liberal cause. He doesn't seem to register that 3 of the victims were stabbed (not shot) and the last ""victim"" was the killer committing suicide. So... less than half the victims were murdered by gun (not counting the suicide)... but gun control could have fixed this? I am NOT an advocate for gun control which is probably why this guy bugs me so much. I believe that psycho killers will always find a way to kill, regardless of laws, and the only way to really stop this would have been for other people to have been allowed by the government to be sufficiently armed to stop this loony before he got far.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"CMV: No one ""deserves"" respect based upon a position of authority or power","So I just finished listening to my art teacher childishly scream at our class that he deserves to be respected. When class started, my teacher scolded one kid (who is a troublemaker) for sitting on a desk; he didn't seem too upset at that point. Later in the class, as he began to introduce our next assignment, people we're still chatting as he began to talk. He stopped introducing the assignment and went on a tirade about how he as a teacher deserves to be respected because of what he had to go through to get that job.  I do not believe that anyone inherently deserves respect, no matter who you are. You can't demand someone to respect you, you have to earn their respect. CMV   Edit: I read the comments and I agree with most of them. I think when my teacher complained about us not respecting him I think he was referring to basic respect, and I misinterpreted his definition of respect. I still believe that a deeper kind of respect must be earned, but all people should have a sort of ""baseline respect"" _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I like this definition of respect: &amp;quot;due regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, or traditions of others.&amp;quot; I also agree that respect and basic politeness should be the default position when dealing with people. The problem with the idea of earned respect being the default position, particularly when dealing with positions of authority like teaching or even law enforcement, is that you are unlikely to ever know people occupying these positions well enough to develop feelings of deep admiration associated with earned respect. However, it is the &lt;em&gt;position&lt;/em&gt; a person should respect in these instances anyway, because many positions of authority are also positions of service. By disrespecting the teacher, those students are not just disrespecting the teacher&amp;#39;s service--they are also disrespecting the rest of the students there who may wish to benefit from that service.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have actively disliked many people in positions of authority, but would never dream of insulting them or being impolite out of respect for their position. I would not have thrown a shoe at Pres. Bush, Jr. I would never disrupt a classroom because it would be rude to the other students who had either paid good money to be there (college) or were actually interested in the material (K-12). I wouldn&amp;#39;t mouth off to a police officer no matter how much I disagreed with his opinion on how fast I was driving. I wouldn&amp;#39;t spit on a soldier if he or she had fought in a war I felt was unjust. I&amp;#39;m an atheist who strongly disagrees with many of the positions held by the Catholic Church, but I would not insult the Pope or a priest. I&amp;#39;ve hated many of my bosses, but I would not be impolite to them. Most of the time, there are more socially acceptable and productive ways to express displeasure in how things are being done by people in positions in authority. Complaints to the school board in the cases of incompetence, for instance. Voting for the other guy. Fighting the ticket. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think this is why many people talk about respect in terms of quantity, because for most people, a basic, default level of respect for other human beings is their starting position. People will say &amp;quot;I have a lot of respect for this person.&amp;quot; Or, on reddit, &amp;quot;Much respect.&amp;quot; I think that&amp;#39;s the feeling of deep admiration you&amp;#39;re talking about when you talk about earned respect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respect is something people often disagree on the definition of, especially without qualifying explanations of the degree of respect or the situation in which the respect is being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From my perspective, on the baseline, everyone deserves a certain level of respect until proven otherwise. This is what I would call the &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t be a dick&amp;quot; rule (Edit: Also sometimes known as &amp;quot;normal human decency&amp;quot;). But from another perspective, this is not &lt;em&gt;earned&lt;/em&gt; respect. This is standard. Everyone gets it until you have a reason to retract it, and if you&amp;#39;re one of the people who doesn&amp;#39;t extend this type and level of respect to strangers, then you&amp;#39;re probably someone I&amp;#39;ll quickly retract offering it to. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Respect beyond this can come in one of two ways. Most commonly it is earned, by forming a personal relationship with a person and learning their value. This is the type of respect most people are talking about when they say, &amp;quot;You have to earn respect&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s also institutional respect. This isn&amp;#39;t respect for &amp;quot;authority&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;position&amp;quot;, but a respect for a human being&amp;#39;s function in &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; life even if you don&amp;#39;t really know them. This is the type of respect that is normal for a student-teacher relationship (note: it goes both ways). It differs from &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t be a dick&amp;quot; only in that the people in question have been predetermined to fill a certain role in each other&amp;#39;s lives, and as such they need to spend time working together to do whatever it is they&amp;#39;re supposed to be doing in their roles without rubbing each other badly. It may also indicate one person doing a lot of hard work that is ultimately more for the other person or group&amp;#39;s benefit should be shown a certain minimum of deference. In your example, teaching and learning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"CMV: Most people who are prescribed antidepressant drugs as a treatment for depression do not need them as their depression isn't caused by a chemical imbalance, but by real-world stressors.","No, I don't think that all people diagnosed with depression should ""just deal with it"".  I understand that depression can be a terrible thing that negatively affects your life in a number of untold ways.  I also acknowledge that antidepressants can be an effective treatment.  However, I think that there are too few standards from separating depression caused by imbalances in brain-chemistry, and depression stemming from real-world stressors such as personal finance, relationships, career futures, politics, and much more.  Here are the top three arguments I hear against my position and why I don't agree:  &gt;1: People with clinical depression can't just ""get over it"" or ""deal with it"".  Antidepressants save lives by finally giving people relief from the depression and anxiety that plagues them.  Imagine that you are $150k in student/credit debt.  Despite having a bachelor's degree you make $30k annually, see nearly a third of that money eaten up with taxes, and nearly half of what's left get's spent on rent, which is increasing annually.  In the end, you barely have enough to make your minimum payments.  The cherry on top is that your boss brings home $500k annually and treats you like a peasant at work, albeit when he isn't ""working from home"".  Every day you have to think about the future and how your current situation affects you.  You have to think about future-you.  Your prospects are bleak - some might say *depressing*.  You can't just sleep it off or ""get over it"", because it's not changing.  The only thing you can do is try to earn more money, pay your debts, find a job that makes you happy, etc.  But instead you focus on how it makes you feel:  You determine you cannot eliminate the depression on your own so you get antidepressants.  All you are doing is numbing the pain of the real world.  You don't have a condition, but you *are* depressed.  The difference is that you are depressed for a reason, and that depression might be what you need to motivate yourself to fix your problems.  The pills just make you accept your fate rather than work for a brighter future.  In this context they are complacency pills...  &gt;2: Doctors don't get kickbacks for prescribing certain medicines.  No, they don't.  It's illegal to pay a doctor in exchange for prescribing people medications.  Instead pharmaceutical companies do what lobbyist do:  They send doctors to ""seminars"", which is just an excuse to send them somewhere exciting for a week at an all-inclusive resort all while bombarding them with marketing for the medicines they manufacture.  They don't have take the company's advice, buy your crazy if you think they aren't influenced by the bribery.  Not that it matters, Doctors already find it easier to prescribe ""miracle pills"" rather than look for less risky treatment options.  Though often, pills are all the only thing a patient can afford as therapy is too expensive.  &gt;3: People depend on Antidepressants for their day-to-day lives.  You can't just take that away from them or doubt the effectiveness of the drugs.  That's insulting!  The feelings of the patients are irrelevant, as they are not doctors and they are biased.  Some people truly need antidepressants, and they shouldn't be denied it.  That doesn't mean we shouldn't question the usefulness of these drugs when they are being prescribed more and more often, many times as a first choice of treatment.  These drugs have severe side-effects, including depression!  Why risk screwing someone up worse when they actually can get over it themselves.  **Tl;Dr:** The standards for prescribing antidepressants don't take into account whether the depression is chemical or circumstantial.  Many of the arguments against stricter regulation are appeals to emotion, not science.  Now we have a lot of people on pills that just numb the pain of the real world (which isn't much different than illicit drug abuse - minus the high).  However, clinical depression does exist and some people *do* need antidepressants to function normally.  These people likely make up a minority of those prescribed antidepressants to treat depression.  NOTE:  Yes, SSRI's marketed as antidepressants can be prescribed for a variety of other problems, including medical problems that have nothing to do with the brain.  I am not taking these situations into account; only drugs prescribed to treat depression. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

How would you tell someone &amp;quot;yes, I know you struggle to get to work every monday because you&amp;#39;re in such dire straights, but we can&amp;#39;t give you anti depressants because your depression is caused by your financial stress, so you need to pay 100 dollars an hour for a psychologist.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) That sounds like going back to &amp;quot;get over yourself depressed person&amp;quot; argument.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately the &amp;quot;ideal&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t exist.

It&amp;#39;s hard to sit down and figure out what to do when you feel like you are barely treading water. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In regards to point 2- Of course providers would rather prescribe drugs instead of therapies. Insurance reimburses very poorly for therapy, and often times has limits (like how many times you can see a therapist in a year). I wouldn&amp;#39;t say they are bought by drug companies, but our medical system is set up to favor drug therapies as opposed to other therapies. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From my personal life I have been on antidepressants. It helped me get through a very stressful and upsetting time in my life. I was in counseling, and doing my best to get through my life despite the emotional rollercoaster that had become my life. One day I was upset about something and I had the overwhelming urge to go home and cut. Thankfully I was still in a sane enough to realize that was not good. I took pills for a few months until I was stablized enough to not have that risk again.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"""Nuclear power is bad"", CMV","**My view has been changed, I am also sorry for abandoning the threat, I completely forgot about it. The two users who contributed to changing my view the most were awarded deltas accordingly.**  I believe that we should not use nuclear power and instead focus on renewable resources.  With rising population and advancing technology, the power demand of humanity is increasing. And we must meet that demand and provide sufficient power to cover all our needs. There are various ways of doing so. Today, the most of our power is suppiled by fossil-fuel-burning power plants. However, they present serious threat to the enviroment, so we need to look for our power sources elsewhere. The other options are renewable resources, scuch as water, sunlight, and wind; or nuclear power. I do NOT believe that nuclear power is the right way of progress, and I believe so for these reasons:  1) The price. Nuclear power plants are incredibly expensive to build and maintain. The building costs a small fortune, since all the reactors, shielding, and other protective structures are exteptionally hard and costly to build. Then there is the nuclear fuel, the mos common being U235. It is quite hard to get. The mining alone is quite tedious , moreover, it damages the surroundings a lot, and it's expencive to restore to the previous state. What's more, some of the damages to nature, the common heritage of mankind, are irreparable whatsoever. The fuel is also hard to process and transport, both of which are not only expensive, but also present a serious threat to the enviroment, which is, as I have explained before, not exactly a thing we want. And the same goes to the costs and risks of nuclear waste transport, reprocessing or disposal.  In conclusion, nuclear power is costly in both economical and enviromental aspects.  2) safety. I have to concede, that modern nuclear powerplants are quite safe and a major safety failure is just a rare occurence. However, the damage these potential failures can bring upon mankind and the enviroment is immense. In case of major breach of the reactor shielding huge anmounts of radiation and/or fallout escape the power plant. These horribly affect global enviroment and severely damage human health. although it is true that the failure is quite improbable, if it occurs, the aftermath will be disastrous. Another safety hazard is the risk of the power plant being damaged in the instance of war or terrorist attack. Power plants are important military targets, so in the case of war are likely to be attacked. The possibility of a disaster following the destruction of a nuclaer power plant also makes it an extcellent target for terrosrists, who just want to cause maximal damage. To sum this up, there is possibility of a safety failure, and despite its low pobability it is still not worth the possible outcome.  3) Alternative sources. As I mentioned at the very beginning, there are other means of getting power. The alterantive resources, such as water, air and sloar power are cheaper to harness and present barely any threat to our planet. I believe that instead of focusing on nuclear power, inovations should be ecnouraged in this area  I believe that nuclear power is simply too dangerous to utilize. We should therefore focus on alternative resources, as they are more enviroment friendly, safer, cheaper and do not present a major threat to mankind.  Wow, a bit longer than I expected. Mostly, the thing is that in my country, they are planning on expanding one of our power plants, and the Austirans think it's wrong, and I basicaly second this attitude. so, please, CMV  **EDIT: Thanks for the great comments! I'll try to respond to some of them, but I've had a long day and am totally exhausted, so I'll reply more tomorrow.**","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Nuclear power is only expensive because people are irrationally afraid of it and so it is vastly over-regulated. If it was treated like other power plants, much newer technologies would be on the market that would make electricity a fraction of its current price - making it possible for all economies to grow faster, especially poor economies in the developing world where people can&amp;#39;t even afford clean water, nitrogen fixing (food), refrigeration (medicine and food), and climate control (disease vectors and productivity.) Not much new has happened in basic nuclear reactor tech for over 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) nuclear power is far safer than any other power source, even taking into account Chernobyl, which can&amp;#39;t happen again since no one operates plants that primitive anymore. Three Mile Island and Fukushima will not cause a statistically observable increase in cancer or civilian deaths according to the WHO. Actually, not using nuclear causes millions of deaths, according to NASA&amp;#39;s research center at Goddard because coal is the usual alternative since renewables are only practical for a small fraction of the world&amp;#39;a needs. Coal, the worlds biggest and fastest growing source of energy - even in Germany - puts out far more radiation than nuclear plants.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) genIV nuclear actually is renewable as it can consume previous generations waste and can generate almost none itself. Other renewables are only able to be used for 10-20% of our needs as they are very limited by physical conditions. People also don&amp;#39;t realize that the supply chains and construction of renewables create a lot of pollution and accidental death during construction, installation, and maintainence. In the end, people afraid of nuclear mostly use fossil fuels - which are far more dangerous and inefficient in virtually every conceivable way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: nuclear sounds scary to some, but a future without much more of it online will continue to condemn millions to early death and poverty. China, India, and France mostly get this and are pressing ahead while many others waffle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price - Nuclear power plants are not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; prohibitively expensive. Look at France, it is 80% nuclear, and their energy is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; cheap that they sell it to the rest of Europe. France has one of the best energy systems in the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Safety - Modern western power plants are very safe, people just get the idea of them being dangerous from past events, like Chernobyl. Did you know the Chernobyl plant was just a modified Submarine Reactor? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Alternative Sources - A lot of alternative sources are prohibitive. Solar energy needs to be attached to a gas plant, because it isn&amp;#39;t reliable... Water can only be built in certain places, same with wind... etc. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit: Nuclear power plants are the answer to most of the worlds pollution problems. The only reason to oppose Nuclear energy is because you are misinformed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: The movie ""The Interview"" is an example of cyber-bullying, and making Kim Jong Un mad will do no good.","In the American education system, kids are taught that cyber bullying is bad. Then they get into the real world and see a movie like ""The Interview"" which is making fun of Kim Jong Un. Imagine if someone made a movie about you that is about people trying to kill you. It is simply cyber bullying.  Kim Jong Un is not a good person, and certainly is not trying to help the citizens of North Korea. However, you can get into trouble in school for cyber bullying someone who has even bullied other people him/herself. If Obama defends Sony for cyber bullying Kim Jong Un, why doesn't he defend cyber bullies in schools? Isn't is freedom of speech too?  edit: Additionaly, aggrevating Kim Jong Un is bad for the people of North Korea. It will only make him madder and more resisted to doing what Ameica wants, which is to stop the harm that is coming to the citizens of Noth Korea. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

His actions are qualitatively different from &amp;quot;bullying other people,&amp;quot; since he has sent people to prison camps for the rest of their lives and commanded and condoned the murder of many others.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To concretize this, here is an example of an evil thing Kim Jong Un&amp;#39;s regime has done.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;TOKYO — North Korea has sentenced Matthew Miller to six years of hard labor for committing “hostile acts,” after the American reportedly ripped up his tourist visa upon arrival at the Pyongyang airport in April.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-korea-sentences-american-matthew-miller-to-6-years-of-hard-labor/2014/09/14/aa91ac40-3c05-11e4-b03f-de718edeb92f_story.html""&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Can you imagine the rage and anguish this man and his family must be feeling? How would you feel if this happened to you or one of your loved ones on a visit to another country? Isn&amp;#39;t this wildly disproportionate to Mr. Miller&amp;#39;s offense and a violation of his rights?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;No moral person should feel any sympathy for Kim Jong Un, and every moral person should wish for his misery and death. Furthermore, satirizing Kim John Un is helpful and necessary for undermining the credibility of this evil man and highlighting his depravity, which is not a justification that real cyber-bullying ever has.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Jong Un being an evil dictator -- which he is -- kind of negates that.  He&amp;#39;s no Hitler, of course, but only because North Korea isn&amp;#39;t powerful enough to start annexing its neighbors and has no substantial minority population to send to death camps.  So, yes, the movie is &amp;quot;bullying&amp;quot; a dictator, and of course he isn&amp;#39;t going to like it.  But he likes oppressing and torturing his citizens, so I&amp;#39;d say his priorities hardly count.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s talk about what you call &amp;quot;freedom of speech&amp;quot;.  The idea is that you should be able to say anything without restriction by the government, and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that you should be able to say anything without consequences.  You&amp;#39;re still liable for what you say!  Conspiracy to commit a crime is speech and it&amp;#39;s still a problem, not because of the speaking but because of the crime.  Bullying is another kind of speech that hurts people; it&amp;#39;s not the speech that&amp;#39;s illegal but the hurting of others.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But you&amp;#39;re saying bullying of bullies is still bad -- well, sure, but Kim Jong Un isn&amp;#39;t a bully.  He&amp;#39;s a murderous dictator.  Bit of a difference there.  As a public figure, he&amp;#39;s a valid target, but remember libel and slander are still illegal!  As a work of satire, The Interview avoids that part, and since he&amp;#39;s an evil dictator, we really don&amp;#39;t care whether he likes it or not.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Making that movie about a regular dude -- or even a celebrity -- would be grounds for a libel/slander lawsuit.

I think Russia has chronically under-delivered as a nation of it's size in contributing to the progress of the human race. CMV,"The current conflict around Ukraine has returned this thought to the forefront of my mind, but it's something I've thought of quite frequently. When I think of nations of similar size and/or population and/or power, I can immediately come up with great ideas or cultural artefacts that it's contribute to the progress of the human race, either scientifically or culturally- India, China, the US for example. However, I always struggle to find anything great that Russia has contribute to human progress.  As a contrast, I'd offer Great Britain, as I am British. I'd like to point out, however, that I'm neither patriotic nor think of the British as particularly superior to any other grouping of people. I'd also point out that I think the Empire was not particularly a ""good thing"". However, I think it could easily be argued that Britain's contribution to human progress has been great, in particular when compared to it's size. In contrast, Russia is a country that covers 11.5% of the world's land, and has a large population (though small for it's size). Most of it's history is littered with cruel tyrants treating their population as slaves and when this finally changed in the 20th century, they were taken over by other tyrants masquerading as heroes of the people. And when those tyrants were finally overthrown at the end of the 20th century, they were replaced by gangsters who had previously worked for those tyrants. I think their greatest contribution has been to the defeat of Hitler in WW2, but I can't think of much else. Please, change my view!  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

By your standards, one has to assume you think Canada is the lowest of the low.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Comparing Russia to England isn&amp;#39;t that good of a parallel. First, English civilization is far older than Russian civilization (Moscow in 1450 reached the size of London in 100). Also England has had the benefit of a far friendlier biome (most of Rusian history has been battling the insanely infertile tundra they started in), weather (Russia has harsh winters, England has a very mild climate), and geography (Russia has been relatively landlocked for most of existence - it&amp;#39;s historical influence has been largely limited to it&amp;#39;s neighbors because of such). It&amp;#39;s actually impressive that they&amp;#39;ve managed to grow into such a big country from where they started, and they&amp;#39;ve arguably managed to expand their empire less genocidally than the British (though that&amp;#39;s not a high bar).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Overall, Russia&amp;#39;s influence on literature and theatre has been massive, probably only second to England (though it&amp;#39;s concentrated on a fewer key authors), and those authors have had a much wider influence beyond those spheres (Dostoevsky alone had a singnificant influence on people like Freud, Nietzsche, etc.). They&amp;#39;ve had many influential scientists, especially in physics, math, and chemistry, as well as many other significant artistic influences, from the sublime (Tchaikovsky) to the ridiculous (Malevich).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also they (or their winter) are primarily responsible for defeating both Hitler and Napoleon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you consider art a contribution to humanity or are you only talking science/technology?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Art - Russia has some of the greatest writers and composers in history.

"CMV: Football is an institution which causes more problems than it solves, and receives far more money than it deserves.","First disclaimer: I don't like football; I've never seen the appeal of men kicking a ball around a field while lots of people scream. I'm putting this here so my biases on the issue are clear.   Second disclaimer: as a Brit, I'm focusing on English football, not handegg. References to the latter are fine where relevant.   I don't think football provides any external benefit to society - by which I mean, it doesn't actually help anyone outside of the football industry. All I see, when I see football supporters, is people trying to assert their dominance over other people by reinforcing the status of ""their"" team, or putting down the other team. This is usually light-hearted in uni circles, but I know this gets a lot worse.   The 100 hour war, between Honduras and El Salvador, was triggered by a football game. Granted, the game itself was a small block removed from an already very unstable Jenga tower, but it seems to me that all football does it bring out the tribalistic, irrational animal in people that allows the 100 hour war and the Hillsborough disaster to happen. I can't see it as a tool for peace or friendship or discourse or understanding; all I see is anger, rivalry, shouting. It reinforces the same sort of in-group-out-group ""You belong to a different tribe therefore you are bad"" mentality that leads to xenophobia, and from there, racism and overzealous nationalism (read: UKIP.) This sort of mentality is something we need to keep a lid on, I believe, if we want to have a more peaceful society.   I'm aware, though, that there's likely a lot I'm not taking into consideration, and that my strong dislike for football has coloured my views no small amount. I'd like to gain a rounder perspective on the issue, so please CMV.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to address the sport of football rather than just professional football&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think football provides any external benefit to society - by which I mean, it doesn&amp;#39;t actually help anyone outside of the football industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other than bringing entertainment and happiness to Billions of people who watch football around the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other than being fun and an outlet for physical activity for hundreds of millions of people of play the sport around the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other than providing jobs for (hundreds) of thousands of non players (coaches, trainers, stadium staff, writers, TV crews) around the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other than making some players wealthy and helping to lift others out of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other than all those things, it doesn&amp;#39;t really have any external benefit to society.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I understand that some of those fall under &amp;quot;football industry&amp;quot; but its a huge group of people to just dismiss. If you really wanna get into it movies, television, literature, music and art really don&amp;#39;t have any external benefits to society. I know lots of people (and I bet you do to) who look down on others because of their choices in entertainment.

The second amendment is often discussed in terms of gun ownership, but it seems very clear to me that the purpose of the amendment is to grant citizens the right to band together and protect themselves and their communities, using deadly force if necessary.  Don't get me wrong, I'm very glad it hasn't escalated to such a disastrous degree.

They would have definitely seen it as a sort of civil disorder, like the Whisky Rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The second amendment has any purposes.  As you&amp;#39;ve mentioned it is a guarantee against tyranny, but the framers also viewed it as a tool to obviate the need to maintain a powerful standing army.  If states were able to provide units of equipped, trained light infantry it would allow the federal government time to assemble a national army in the event of a national security crisis.  To the framers a standing army was not only a Cromwellian threat to liberty, but also a phenomenally expensive endeavor with little marginal return. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition, guns were generally pretty central to the American way of life in the 1790&amp;#39;s.  You could feed your family with a long rifle, participate in social exercises, and defend your property from bandits and thieves in situations where law enforcement may have been remote.  It encouraged self sufficiency and community values.  The framers had seen efforts to restrict weapons ownership in Europe and  wanted to forestall that by just saying &amp;quot;everybody gets to own guns!&amp;quot; In fact, many were legally required to maintain a firearm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why in particular do you feel it&amp;#39;s so &amp;quot;specific&amp;quot; or clear? The text of that amendment has always read very ambiguously to me. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The security of a free state&amp;quot; could imply any number of things, couldn&amp;#39;t it? But it&amp;#39;s not explicit what in particular it implies. Does it mean defense against invasion by foreign nations? Protection from a government that some gun owners have decided is behaving tyrannical? Provision for the guerilla war we&amp;#39;ll need to fight when an alien war machine arrives from the other end of the universe to assimilate us?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I would accept that it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; mean any of these things, I&amp;#39;d argue it&amp;#39;s not incontrovertibly true that it does mean any of them in particular (although I would suspect that to many, defense from foreign invasion would be the concern that would trump all others). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You can definitely find perspectives from some of the founding fathers that support the view that the second amendment should act as a check on the government&amp;#39;s own potential for tyranny, but that is true of pretty much everything that&amp;#39;s in the constitution; you can consult the various founders&amp;#39; written views on everything and end up with a wealth of disagreement as to what purpose each article and amendment&amp;#39;s should serve, as well as to their limits and purview. Hence why we have a court system that exists to debate these issues since we don&amp;#39;t have the founders around to poll for their specific thoughts on every conflict that arises.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another issue that confounds the matter is that while the second amendment protects gun ownership (at least in some sense, the extent of which has been debated for ages), the Constitution also contradictorily empowers the federal government to put down rebellions. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Article I, Section 8:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Congress shall have the power...To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So we have two ideas that are sort of at cross-purposes. You&amp;#39;re saying &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;re supposed to use guns to resist,&amp;quot; but the response to that could well be, &amp;quot;The government is obligated to use force to quash your resistance and the potential threat it represents to the safety and stability of the republic&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lemme turn your founding father example around for a sec to look at it from the other side. A bunch of religious fundamentalists  get together and say, &amp;quot;Well fuck, we don&amp;#39;t like that the government allows for any kind of legal abortions anywhere. We think it&amp;#39;s a sin and we can&amp;#39;t believe the government is oppressing human life by sanctioning it! Fuck democracy, let&amp;#39;s start an armed rebellion and show these bastards that they can&amp;#39;t enforce their tyranny on us! Get your guns and let&amp;#39;s storm the capitol!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Are these people in the right? Are they not using the same reasoning you are? They believe themselves to be using force via the second amendment to resist the overreach of a tyrannical government.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the second amendment exists to protect what political theorists sometimes refer to as the &amp;quot;right of revolution&amp;quot;, then what determines when the exercise of that right is just? Am I allowed to murder agents of the government and defend myself by claiming that the second amendment enshrines my right to do so in protection of my interests? If I&amp;#39;d be wrong to claim this, why would it be so?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a thorny problem of recognizing that it&amp;#39;s easy to support a constitutional right to violent resistance when it&amp;#39;s in defense of a cause you support, but a lot tougher when it&amp;#39;s a cause you find abhorrent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"I don't buy the argument that ""you can't consent to being harmed."" CMV.","My mom was making an argument that (as I understand it) goes something like this: 1. Sane people do not want to be harmed.  2. Therefore, sane people will not consent to harm.  3. Therefore, by definition, someone who consents to harm is not competent to give consent.   3. Therefore, harm is always nonconsensual because even if the person *thinks* they are consenting, they are by definition incompetent to consent, because they are agreeing to be harmed.  (note: this assumes that consent means *informed* consent - we both agree that if you don't know what you're consenting to, that the consent is meaningless in the first place)  She extended this all the way out to suicide: if you attempt suicide, you are by definition mentally incompetent to make life-or-death decisions, because you're suicidal.   My responses to this:  1. This is circular reasoning and therefore completely unconvincing to me because I don't buy into the premise (which is also the conclusion).   2. From a more pragmatic/legislative perspective, who gets to decide what ""harm"" is? Is it physical injury? X level of pain? Visible marks? Permanent injury? What if I'm really into BDSM and the physical pain of getting spanked (or whatever) produces such a great mental benefit that the overall effect is positive? Would this fall under ""you're not really consenting to harm in that case""? Again, how would you measure or judge this?   3. Excluding people who think the harm will ultimately be a net benefit (the BDSM scenario), maybe there is no *rational* reason from a purely self-interested perspective to consent to harm, but human beings do all kinds of things for irrational reasons and yet we don't consider that to invalidate their consent. Why is this different?   Also as a side note, the fact that people who try and fail to commit suicide often claim that they're glad they failed proves nothing. Regret after the fact does not prove that you didn't consent at the time.  Second side note: I know Locke has this whole argument about how you do not have the moral authority to end your life because it's essentially just yours on lease from God and you don't have the authority to total the Almighty's car. So that's nice from a religious perspective, but I'm not religious so it isn't particularly convincing to me.   So...change my view? Is there a better argument that I'm not considering here? I'm interested in opinions both from a moral and a practical/legal perspective.   (edit: ack formatting!)","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure on your definition of harm? If someone breaks their nose or pulls their shoulder out of socket you must do harm to their bodies and inflict more pain in order to restore them to better health. You must re-break a nose to make it heal straight. If you have a dying tooth that is causing pain a dentist must pull out your tooth causing harm for your benefit. But I&amp;#39;d say if you don&amp;#39;t want this harm you aren&amp;#39;t being rational. By the definition of physical injury these scenarios are harm. So harm is a term that relies on context to decide morality. It&amp;#39;s not bad on it&amp;#39;s own. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a huge practical problem with allowing harming/killing someone with their consent: every perpetrator that wanted to cause harm without consent would simply make sure that they can present a written or recorded consent testimony of the victim.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Under innocent until proven guilty, it would then be up to the victim or their survivors to prove that the consent was actually coerced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV I am pro-abortion and believe that abortion is better than foster care or adoption,"Parents who consider giving up their child tend to be poor. There are already many poor children and it would be better to reduce their number by abortion.  Those children who go through the foster care system have higher unemployment rate and earn less income, http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/fostercare-agingout02/  Children who have been through foster care are more likely to be homeless, are less educated, or incarcerated, http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2007/06/foster-care-children-need-better-educational-opportunities  Many children who were adopted wish they had been aborted, https://www.facebook.com/AbortionNotAdoption  EDIT: My view is based on antinatalism and that to give birth is to often cause harm. While the future quality of life cannot be predicted with absolute certainty for a given birth, it can often be predicted with reasonable accuracy. Given the poor life outcomes of those in foster care, their parents were reckless in procreation. To change my view, you would need to show that life is always better even when the quality of life is very poor.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m pro-choice, but I find a lot of logical flaws in your reasoning here. The foster care system needs some serious reform, but encouraging abortion won&amp;#39;t necessarily help anything or reduce kids. Many children in foster care were not &amp;quot;given up.&amp;quot; Most children who are given up while they are babies are adopted - there are waiting lists for babies. Children in the foster care system were generally had by choice (perhaps a few of their crap parents might have gotten abortions if there were a high, immediate monetary incentive or something, but then people would get pregnant just to get abortions as a job so it&amp;#39;s not a do-able solution, nor what pro-choice should be about, IMO). Many are victims of abuse or neglect. Some are victims of circumstance, where parents are jailed or die later. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Most children who are adopted as babies live happy, productive lives. Except for additional healthcare needs (most coming from the adopted-from-foster-care population), adopted kids have high measures of happiness: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2009/11/adopted_kids_are_happy_healthy.html""&gt;http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2009/11/adopted_kids_are_happy_healthy.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://life.familyeducation.com/adoption/nontraditional-families/45763.html""&gt;http://life.familyeducation.com/adoption/nontraditional-families/45763.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Adopted kids even score higher than non-adopted teens in school-success. This does NOT include foster kids, who you are right - they have lower success rates. This is not necessarily due to the system they&amp;#39;re in, but rather how they got there, but the system could accommodate that better.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other results&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, the adopted teens in the study scored better than their nonadopted siblings or a sample of their peers in …&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Connectedness—having three or more friends and having access to two or more nonparent adults for advice. Caring—placing a high value on helping other people. Social competency—friendship-making and assertiveness skills. Adopted teens also scored higher than nonadopted adolescents in …&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;School achievement—having a B average or better and aspiring to higher education. Optimism—expecting to be happy in 10 years and expecting to be successful as an adult. Support—having a high level of support from parents and from school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The foster care system would not be diminished by promoting abortion, so unless you&amp;#39;re mandating poor people get abortions (which is as bad as outlawing abortions for the same reasoning that I am pro-life; I can get into that, but I feel your argument is not about compelling people to abort by mandatory law per se - let me know if I&amp;#39;m wrong). And even then, not necessarily. Additionally, those children would likely be adopted as babies if the parents had been identified as &amp;quot;poor parenting choices&amp;quot; by whatever magical means you suggest this could happen and adopted then. Then, they&amp;#39;d be better off than the general population, not worse, as adopted kids do very well!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents who consider giving up their child for adoption are usually young / kids themselves. If you give up a baby for adoption it will spend no time in foster care, as the waiting list for adopting a baby is usually 5+ years. There are people waiting to adopt children. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Children who go through foster care are not children who were given up - they were children who were taken away from their parents. They have usually suffered severe neglect or worse in their lives, and it is very difficult for children to deal with insecurity. The two (adopting a baby, adopting from foster care, welfare of general adopted children, welfare of children who go through foster care) are not comparable. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for your last point, many people wish they were never born. should we advocate no births, only abortions for the human species because a small minority of people wish they hadn&amp;#39;t been born? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"""Nuclear power is bad"", CMV","**My view has been changed, I am also sorry for abandoning the threat, I completely forgot about it. The two users who contributed to changing my view the most were awarded deltas accordingly.**  I believe that we should not use nuclear power and instead focus on renewable resources.  With rising population and advancing technology, the power demand of humanity is increasing. And we must meet that demand and provide sufficient power to cover all our needs. There are various ways of doing so. Today, the most of our power is suppiled by fossil-fuel-burning power plants. However, they present serious threat to the enviroment, so we need to look for our power sources elsewhere. The other options are renewable resources, scuch as water, sunlight, and wind; or nuclear power. I do NOT believe that nuclear power is the right way of progress, and I believe so for these reasons:  1) The price. Nuclear power plants are incredibly expensive to build and maintain. The building costs a small fortune, since all the reactors, shielding, and other protective structures are exteptionally hard and costly to build. Then there is the nuclear fuel, the mos common being U235. It is quite hard to get. The mining alone is quite tedious , moreover, it damages the surroundings a lot, and it's expencive to restore to the previous state. What's more, some of the damages to nature, the common heritage of mankind, are irreparable whatsoever. The fuel is also hard to process and transport, both of which are not only expensive, but also present a serious threat to the enviroment, which is, as I have explained before, not exactly a thing we want. And the same goes to the costs and risks of nuclear waste transport, reprocessing or disposal.  In conclusion, nuclear power is costly in both economical and enviromental aspects.  2) safety. I have to concede, that modern nuclear powerplants are quite safe and a major safety failure is just a rare occurence. However, the damage these potential failures can bring upon mankind and the enviroment is immense. In case of major breach of the reactor shielding huge anmounts of radiation and/or fallout escape the power plant. These horribly affect global enviroment and severely damage human health. although it is true that the failure is quite improbable, if it occurs, the aftermath will be disastrous. Another safety hazard is the risk of the power plant being damaged in the instance of war or terrorist attack. Power plants are important military targets, so in the case of war are likely to be attacked. The possibility of a disaster following the destruction of a nuclaer power plant also makes it an extcellent target for terrosrists, who just want to cause maximal damage. To sum this up, there is possibility of a safety failure, and despite its low pobability it is still not worth the possible outcome.  3) Alternative sources. As I mentioned at the very beginning, there are other means of getting power. The alterantive resources, such as water, air and sloar power are cheaper to harness and present barely any threat to our planet. I believe that instead of focusing on nuclear power, inovations should be ecnouraged in this area  I believe that nuclear power is simply too dangerous to utilize. We should therefore focus on alternative resources, as they are more enviroment friendly, safer, cheaper and do not present a major threat to mankind.  Wow, a bit longer than I expected. Mostly, the thing is that in my country, they are planning on expanding one of our power plants, and the Austirans think it's wrong, and I basicaly second this attitude. so, please, CMV  **EDIT: Thanks for the great comments! I'll try to respond to some of them, but I've had a long day and am totally exhausted, so I'll reply more tomorrow.**","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price - Nuclear power plants are not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; prohibitively expensive. Look at France, it is 80% nuclear, and their energy is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; cheap that they sell it to the rest of Europe. France has one of the best energy systems in the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Safety - Modern western power plants are very safe, people just get the idea of them being dangerous from past events, like Chernobyl. Did you know the Chernobyl plant was just a modified Submarine Reactor? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Alternative Sources - A lot of alternative sources are prohibitive. Solar energy needs to be attached to a gas plant, because it isn&amp;#39;t reliable... Water can only be built in certain places, same with wind... etc. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit: Nuclear power plants are the answer to most of the worlds pollution problems. The only reason to oppose Nuclear energy is because you are misinformed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;1: The price is mainly because of reactionary legislation based on irrational fear. If the procedures and safety measures were equivalent to those of equally hazardous non-radioactive chemicals, the price comes down a lot. There are also fuels other than U-235, including plutonium and thorium.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2: Radiation is a lot like fire, it can be very scary, but if you understand it it can be used safely. Nuclear power is extremely safe, even with the current crop of outdated power plants:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy Source Mortality Rates; Deaths/yr/TWh  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Coal - world average, 161&lt;br/&gt; Coal - China, 278&lt;br/&gt; Coal - USA, 15&lt;br/&gt; Oil - 36&lt;br/&gt; Natural Gas - 4&lt;br/&gt; Biofuel/Biomass - 12&lt;br/&gt; Peat - 12&lt;br/&gt; Solar/rooftop - 0.44-0.83&lt;br/&gt; Wind - 0.15&lt;br/&gt; Hydro - world, 0.10&lt;br/&gt; Hydro - world*, 1.4&lt;br/&gt; Nuclear - 0.04  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=""http://theenergycollective.com/willem-post/191326/deaths-nuclear-energy-compared-other-causes""&gt;http://theenergycollective.com/willem-post/191326/deaths-nuclear-energy-compared-other-causes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) Power companies need energy sources that can react to demand, Wind, and solar power are frequently disrupted, and hydroelectric power is still subject to droughts and geography.  As for pollution, the main by-product of a nuclear power plant is steam, that&amp;#39;s what comes out of those big iconic cooling towers: water vapor.  The radioactive waste is a problem, but not a technical, environmental, or safety problem. It&amp;#39;s a legal and political problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: I don't believe it's possible for a man to find me physically/sexually attractive, even if I lost more weight.","I would like to here some reasons why it might be possible though.  I know it's not right to think this, but I cant get the awful thought out of my head that a man would be more harsh and critical of the way I look than I would of them or a woman would be of me.  This is something I am constantly going over in my head and I wish I didn't have to. Just check my post history and you will see and get a lot more information. To give brief description, I lost around 50 pounds and still have more to lose but it's left me with some saggy skin that doesn't look like it wants to go away, extremely saggy, deflated breasts that do not look right now. I have an overall flabby looking appearance. I have very little experience with men so I do not have any in person reactions to the way I look. I can only go by picture reactions in previous threads, which are very mixed and not giving me the answers I'm looking for.  What are some things to consider that could change my mind?

That&amp;#39;s it. The awful truth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dudes care about looks, but we&amp;#39;re still people like any other and we look for partners like all humans do. We find someone we like who has the combination of looks and personality that suits us. Does this mean that there is someone out there who will love you? Actually it does. The question is now to put your headspace somewhere where you&amp;#39;re happy with yourself so you can go in with enough firepower to make dating decisions, rather than some loser dude who goes to lengths pursuing a woman who isn&amp;#39;t happy with her looks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now if you want to change your appearance, you should do that. I don&amp;#39;t know what you need to do, but continuing to improve yourself in the way that you want will make you more attractive and will give you more confidence, which is also really sexy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are also other things you can do to put yourself into a place where you want to be. Some are things that are common, like the diet and exercise you&amp;#39;ve been doing. Some are less common like cosmetic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let anyone push you around. It&amp;#39;s your life and body you do with it what you want. I got oral surgery and braces when I was 20 and it made a huge difference to my confidence and looks. I know that those are common procedures, but it&amp;#39;s fundamentally the same as other things. And maybe you don&amp;#39;t even need it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You have a goal in mind and you can do it. Average people can do it and you&amp;#39;ve shown more effort and initiative than average people. All the ingredients are there for you to get what you want.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am going to give you some perspective shift before I make my point.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lets say you looked like this, a 900 lb woman:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v354/westfire/900lb-mom.jpg""&gt;http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v354/westfire/900lb-mom.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Would you be happy? Of course not. But if you asked her if she would rather look like you then she would take that, because at least you are a lot more capable of moving around, and there are numerous advantages you have over her.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course this is not a post about making you feel &amp;quot;be glad that you&amp;#39;re not worse&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;things could be worse&amp;quot;, no mam, keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now take a look at this pic. This is a pic of same woman before and after breast augmentation surgery:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.locateadoc.com/pictures/gallery/breast-augmentation-breast-implants-before-fullsize-17540-32813.jpg""&gt;http://www.locateadoc.com/pictures/gallery/breast-augmentation-breast-implants-before-fullsize-17540-32813.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tell me something, if you looked like her, before breast augmentation, would you be more than happy with it, or would you get breast augmentation surgery like her? Chances are, at this stage, you would be more than exhilarated if you had body like that, and you wouldn&amp;#39;t need breast implants.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But the fact is, that woman did. Somehow, having a great body like that, is still not sufficient. What male attention was she lacking BEFORE her boob job, that she needed a breast implant? The same question is applicable for all those women who got breast implants. The fact is, having a body like that on the left, is still somehow not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So what does that mean? Considering women with great looking bodies are getting boob jobs to look even better, what are they missing there?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Who are these men for whose standards are so high that women need fake tits to get them to be attracted to them?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The fact is, humans are nothing but animals with a rational ability. What is this rational ability? Its the ability we have with which we override our instinct, and take a different route and achieve more desires than ever. A monkey sees a banana, and if he is hungry, he just wants to grab it and eat it. If a hungry you see a banana, you wanna figure out if it doesn&amp;#39;t belong to someone else, and if it does, then you try to resist your temptation and and this way, are able to fulfill a lot more desires than the monkey(I mean you have an apartment, you eat a lot more tasty foods than a monkey, you watch movies, you fly in the sky).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Same goes with human courtship. As much as our biological desires want most men to be attracted to attractive female bodies(so much that women put fake tits and that still work on most men), mankind moves along because attraction for it is still &amp;#39;rational&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I have no (major) attraction for the pics you posted, because they are not that attractive. But I HAVE dated a woman with stomach like yours(it was stretch marks and weight loss, plus some sort of surgery scar which I never asked about). I don&amp;#39;t know anything about you, so when you ask me to rate you, that&amp;#39;s precisely what you are going to hear.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But does that mean you are never going to find someone who is attracted to you? Absolutely not a valid conclusion. Are you going to find someone who is PURELY physically attracted to you? Chances are slim, but do you really want someone to be purely physically attracted to you?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You know it within you, that if you met someone who liked you, purely for your physical body and genuinely found it attractive(but only that), you still won&amp;#39;t be happy, in fact you would still be pretty unhappy. Because your rational mind recognizes the fact that that it won&amp;#39;t last much long if that&amp;#39;s the only thing there is to it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the biggest question is this(and you seem to be asking this at other places in the thread): &lt;strong&gt;Is it possible for a man to have sex with you and enjoy it, based on physical appearance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The answer is definitely yes. But then how can I say it with such certainty?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Consider it this way, lets say you are in the mood of eating some fruits. You walk around the neighborhood and you see a giant sign which says &amp;quot;Fresh Fruits juice!&amp;quot;, do you get water in your mouth, and excitement in your mind. Is the feel the same as if fresh fruit itself were to serve to you? Its because your brain(which has the rational capability) understands that a sign which says &amp;quot;fresh fruit juice&amp;quot; implies fulfillment of the desire of fruits you have.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a monkey which desires a banana can only be excited by the sight and smell of a banana(i.e. on a biological level, without a rational ability, we can only be excited about a real banana, and not an indirect consumption of it). The smell and the sight of a real banana is just a way by which a primitive mind seeks food to satiate its hunger.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Same goes with attraction. Yes, I am a guy and I am attracted towards women based on their physical appearances. But at the end of the day, its my brain which does the thinking and makes me act. Physical attraction is merely a more primitive way by which a man identified a partner who will give him the best offsprings, but almost all people in the world marry based on the rational basis, they marry and are attracted towards a person who would give them the most long term happiness. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also btw, on a sidenote, I wouldn&amp;#39;t ignore the person raising the potential of &amp;#39;depression&amp;#39;. An undiagnosed depression would make you look worse in terms of your own eyes.

"CMV: Couples who wait until marriage to lose their virginity, generally end up having terrible sex lives.","I've seen several friends and family who waited until marriage to have sex but ended up having bad sex lives.  Then when I go online and see blog posts after blog posts about how waiting to lose their virginity after marriage was a terrible mistake (like this one: http://www.xojane.com/sex/true-love-waits-pledge ) I really can't help but feel that ""virgin marriages"" just don't work out in terms of sex life.  I truly want to believe that people can wait until marriage to lose their virginity with the person they love. However I'm starting to get worried because of all these people who aren't being able to handle their sex lives after marriage.  A personal request to everyone who replies:   I used to have the opinion that its completely fine to wait until marriage to have sex but these real life empirical examples all around me is the thing that is most discouraging to me.  So if you can, please try to speak from personal experience, because knowing that I'm hearing a true story about a real person will be more assuring to me than a very well educated opinion at this point.

But then they BOTH are like that, so it should be more compatible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s bad sex - that&amp;#39;s still pretty subjective.  But the bottom line is that two people who really care about each other, are patient and listen to other are going to be able to get each other off.  You might not know as many positions (but there is this thing called the internet, where you can learn) or screw like a porn star, but, if you intentionally wait, sex probably means more to you than just a recreational activity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cheating, etc?  Well, it all comes down to basic compatibility.  Perhaps if one REALLY wanted to and the other insisted on waiting, there&amp;#39;s an incompatibility to be wary of.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For a couple to work, it&amp;#39;s got to be about mutual respect and a desire to make each other happy.

Of these three, only C seems potentially dangerous to me, although (of course) people who are culturally pressured into A and B are more likely to stumble into C.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now if A (one life-partner) is fine without C, then B must be pretty harmless without C, as well... if you do all your sexual experimentation with one partner, you are going to end up in pretty much the same place eventually, whether you start in the back seat of your parents&amp;#39; car or the bridal suite.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Note that teenagers are immensely insecure about their romantic prowess and sexual relationships. You will almost never, as a teenager, her a friend talking publically about how awful their sex life is, but if you go to &lt;a href=""/r/sex""&gt;/r/sex&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""/r/relationships""&gt;/r/relationships&lt;/a&gt; you can find hundreds of anonymous youngsters - sometimes on their third or fourth relationship - baring their souls and asking if sex ever gets better. Your adult, married friends may be frank about their sex problems because they are confident and happy and don&amp;#39;t mind dishing out TMI-style status updates in their journey from awkward virgins to sex deities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, there is not much statistical information about type B and type C, but if you go to &lt;a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr036.pdf""&gt;http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr036.pdf&lt;/a&gt; - specifically pages 19-22 - you can see information of spread of sexual partners. Note two things. First, people with bachelors degrees are most like to have only 1 lifetime sexual partner (and are also skewed into lower numbers in the other categories). We associate college with sluts and sex, but college grads, who presumably make the best decisions and statistically have the lowest rates of divorce, are more likely to have a single partner. Second, look at the breakdown by decade. If first-partner relationships were sexually doomed, you would expect to see twenty-somethings with only one lifetime partner leave their sexual failure of a marriage, and move into the 2- or 3-partner category. But that doesn&amp;#39;t happen: the percentage of people in the one-partner category in their twenties, thirties, and forties is remarkably similar, suggesting that these relationships are durable and thus at least relatively happy. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So overall, while I personally wouldn&amp;#39;t pressure anyone to stay sexually inactive until marriage, your fears aren&amp;#39;t supported by statistics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
I believe bullying should be an expelable offense at first evidence. CMV,"Good day. I'd like to present what I consider the most controversial opinion I hold on anything.  First let me start off by saying that I've been a victim of bullying during half of my teenage years so I know the intricacies of the thing on a first-person basis, that said I also admit that my view could be quite biased on the subject due to that reason. Which is the reason I've decided to put this matter on the table here.  Now WHY I hold this particular belief, because, I'll be brutally honest here, my personal opinion is that bullies are delinquents, nothing more. Schools exist to teach, to educate, having bullies running around making random kids lives hell just because they can't tell right from wrong isn't something anyone should have to deal with.  Now a common retort I hear to this matter is the ol' ""But the bullies might act like that because they have problems at home!"" or  ""Pushing the bullies out of school might make them into criminals"". To me that's just bullshit. Everyone has issues and yet they can still know right from wrong. Besides, schools don't exist to deal with young criminals and delinquents, that's what juvenile halls are for. So please if anyone can avoid using these arguments that would be pretty much essential to me because these two, to me, are pure horsehockey.  So, I guess that's it, come on down and try to change my view on this if you may, I'll be waiting.  My apologies for any mispellings or grammar errors, English isn't my native language and sometimes I tend to screw it up a bit.  EDIT: Alright guys, after reading your posts I came to a conclusion, this proposal is extremist and inefficient, period. Looks good on paper but terrible in practice, on a side note I also learned a few things about the origins of the modern education system, thanks for your opinions guys!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few problems (former inner-city teacher here, by the way):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Setting a policy that expels bullies on the first offense is like having a zero tolerance policy for other issues. It sounds great on paper, but much like the kid who forgets a Boy Scout knife in his backpack and is subsequently expelled for the year, or the kid who went hunting with his grandpa and is now treated like a killer because he forgot that a box of ammo was behind the seat, &lt;em&gt;we need to allow teachers and principals to exercise their judgment&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a teacher, there were numerous incidents where I thought a student was bullying someone else only to find that the situation was more complicated. Perhaps the student who looked to be the aggressor on a regular basis was being provoked by more sneaky and clever kids who knew that she&amp;#39;d get in trouble. I even had a period of multiple months where we thought that a group of Mexican kids were tagging the halls with gang writing and harassing a bunch of black kids. Of course, we later found out that this particular group of &amp;quot;victims&amp;quot; had been tagging the halls themselves, using writing that looked like what the Mexican kids wrote and using the names of gangs near their homes. And here I was thinking those boys were the ones causing problems...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, where do you &amp;quot;draw the line&amp;quot; with regard to such a policy? Where does harmless action suddenly become bullying? Is it when a kid decides to pick on someone else for the first time? Does it have to be extremely serious harassment or does it become bullying when there&amp;#39;s even the slightest inkling of a rude or mean attitude? One&amp;#39;s definition of bullying is often subjective to a certain degree, and the very last thing you need is some automatic-sentencing policy that affects a bunch of rather harmless kids. It&amp;#39;s kind of like the minimum sentencing policies in the criminal justice system: sometimes the punishment doesn&amp;#39;t fit the crime. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Additionally (and I&amp;#39;m not necessarily defending such kids, but instead pointing out something important), the &amp;quot;bullying&amp;quot; is often merely a symptom of something seriously wrong with a kid&amp;#39;s environment at home. Deadbeat parents, poverty, a reaction to abuse, etc. While I agree that bullies should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be allowed to stay in the regular classroom, wouldn&amp;#39;t it be better to put those students in an alternative classroom environment? Why not send them to a different building with appropriate support staff, such as a professional psychologist? If they get their shit together, bring them back. There&amp;#39;s no reason a kid&amp;#39;s stupid decision at 15 to harass a classmate should screw up the rest of his life. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A zero-tolerance, automatic-consequence policy is not as effective as intelligent, capable, and caring adults who assess the situation and act. Now I can &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; relate to the problem many teachers encounter--which is a school administration that will not respond to bullying and even go so far as to allow it to continue--so perhaps we should instead give schools more legal authority to remove problem students &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; an investigation. Maybe we even give teachers a way to get around having a principal approve such actions. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number one problem is that bullying is a blanket term that defines a vast array of possible behaviors, some of which are totally acceptable under some situations and are totally abhorrent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some schools have defined possible characteristics as &amp;quot;Name calling, joking, aggressive physical contact.&amp;quot; All of those things could totally happen between friends. Boys who actually are friends with each other will do those things and laugh about it because that&amp;#39;s what they do. Of course half of them would be chucked out under your proposal. Adults and schools will always be a step behind when dealing with kids and understanding their inside jokes. I think it would be terrible to have my friend kicked out of school because he played a harmless prank on me&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My other problem is sort of the opposite: while some people would be kicked out for behavior that was not actually malicious in intent, other kids would get away with snide under the radar bullying. It knew a kid who absolutely hated another kid, we&amp;#39;ll call the first guy &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; and the second guy &amp;quot;B.&amp;quot; Every day B would go up to A and say &amp;quot;Hi, A.&amp;quot; It was in a totally obnoxious voice, A hated the guy and hated that he did that. But despite being a form of harassment to an administrator it would look harmless and B would get away with it (which he mostly ended up doing anyway)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your idea sounds good on paper but would be impossible to enforce. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: This might sound mean, but I love Asian girls and yet I worry if I have a family with one and have a boy, he may grow up to have a small penis.","If you watch enough Asian porn this starts to get implanted in your head, I swear.

"CMV: it is not sexist to be okay with hitting women, provided you are also okay with hitting a man who is weaker than you in that situation. If you think it is, you are being sexist.","some people are gandhi level pacifists and think it's always wrong to hit anyone no matter what. some people think it's okay to hit people in self defense. some people think it's okay to hit people if they threaten you or your family. some people think it's okay to hit people if they hit you first. some people think it's okay to hit people if they insult you/ your family/ your beliefs. some people think it's okay to hit people if you feel like it.  whatever the situation, and putting aside the argument for when you think it's actually okay to hit someone, if you call someone a sexist for extending that to women as well as men, you're calling for special rights for women, which is inherently sexist. CMV  I put the caveat of 'men who are weaker than you' since the arguement i usually see is that it's worse because women are physically weaker than men. i can't change the title now, but i should have put 'women who are weaker than you' to make it symmetrical, but oh well.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;you&amp;#39;re calling for special rights for women, which is inherently sexist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Putting aside the general claim of whether it is or isn&amp;#39;t ok to hit women (which, yes, I know is your CMV), this claim in particular is a bit dubious, and since it is a major premise in the argument &lt;em&gt;as you have stated it&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Why is it sexist to call for special rights for women? Well I simply don&amp;#39;t think it is. There are plenty of appropriate rights that are simply for women or adjusted for women. This is mostly because Rights Theory, as it was first devised was the Rights of Man. Obviously man here means &amp;#39;Human&amp;#39;, but still they were devised from an inherently male perspective. Human rights have been changed and adjusted many times to more properly cater to women. Human rights apply to everyone but women are different from men in a lot of ways and if they are devised intending the average person to be male then they fail to fulfil their purpose as human rights. You only need to look at pregnancy and abortion to see that women should and do have different rights in those situations to men. If the Rights of Man are explicitly male focused then &amp;#39;No man can force another man to have an abortion&amp;#39; obviously wouldn&amp;#39;t make any sense to put into the Rights of Man. It is a specifically gendered issue. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Maternity leave and pay is a totally gendered issue also. Paternity leave and pay exists but in most cases it is not seen as equally fundamental or having equal weight (or leave, in fact). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to go into a distinction between female and male circumcision and to what extent they are different but plenty of people do see one as considerably worse and totally cruel whereas one is often seen as fairly normal practice. This, for a lot of people, is another gendered issue in which women need specific rights for women. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In short:  Gender-specific issues exist, and if a Rights Theory is going to work properly at defending the subject of those rights, specifically gendered rights have to exist, which you have claimed is inherently sexist. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course this has no ground against the central claim of your argument so long as your remove that premise as the conclusion that it is sexist to do so. All you have to do is deny that some or all kinds of violence against a person isn&amp;#39;t a gendered issue in the same way that many others are. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, not hitting people is what I&amp;#39;d prefer.

If that and the number of subscribers doesn&amp;#39;t scare you then I don&amp;#39;t know what to say. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If men and women were viewed more equally in society, then it wouldn&amp;#39;t be sexist to be okay with hitting them. Unfortunately, that isn&amp;#39;t the case.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Imagine calling a white person you don&amp;#39;t know the n-word.

CMV: I think I should not have any more philosophical debate with my YEC mother.,"My mother is a deeply loving woman who sent me to Logical and Critical thinking classes as a kid. She has spent her life trying to raise children with clear thinking and a strong moral core. I respect her more than almost anyone in the world.  She also nearly had a degree in biology, but had to abandon that due to personal crisis at the time.  However... she is a Young Earth Creationist, believes people shouldn't write books where people talk to fay (elves, whisps, etc) to get magic because then they're teaching people to open themselves to demons. She was very afraid of Harry Potter and ate up the supposed satanist connections.  She says I'm too cold in my logic, and that life's greatest things (love and god, etc) are not measurable. She says I only talk like I do about ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" because I haven't experienced spiritual powers of good and evil. And she casts my walking away from the faith as ""being just part of the natural rebellion phase. People realize they had it right when they were children, and come back to god.""  She counters my arguments advocating skepticism in regards to ""spiritual matters"" by this condescending ""well you just haven't experienced it"" crap. I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall, there's no conversation when someone just waves it away with a hand. And so, I don't think I can make any headway trying to debate her because I feel like she'll just dismiss anything that doesn't line up with her view. ""I'll be so happy when I understand it all"" in heaven, she says when I bring up conflicting elements oft he bible. It's so MAGICAL and MYSTERIOUS, why could our little minds try to understand.  Thus I see nothing of value to debating her, and just want to spend time enjoying the wonderful person she is otherwise.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should have a philosophic debate with your mother, but it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be a verbal debate involving her evasions and double-standards.  She wants to put the discussion on pragmatic terms - and why not? That will do just fine. She says your commonsense awareness of modern science is&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...just part of the natural rebellion phase. People realize they had it right when they were children, and come back to god.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t an argument you win with words and gesticulations. Win it by being resolutely, quietly, and unapologetically secular. Be logical and quantitative, and have warm, loving relationships.  Don&amp;#39;t ambush her about the Bible, just say &amp;quot;You know I don&amp;#39;t believe those myths, mom!&amp;quot; when she brings them up.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus I see nothing of value to debating her, and just want to spend time enjoying the wonderful person she is otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Debates, verbal or otherwise, don&amp;#39;t have to get in the way of this. Some people are more fun when you can argue with them; but even if your mom isn&amp;#39;t one of them, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that working silently to push back against her prejudices will make your relationship weaker, or that buckling under and letting her pressure you into acting as though you think her worldview is acceptable will make her company more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, by continuing to talk to her, you make sure she isn&amp;#39;t totally in an echo chamber.

"""Egalitarianism"" is an euphemism for anti-feminism and sexism, the same way ""race realism"" is an euphemism for white supremacism. CMV.","As a male feminist concerned with the rights of both genders, I must admit that the name ""feminism"" is really unfortunate. I would have liked to align with the people calling themselves egalitarians, but most ""egalitarian"" forums I've seen seem more concerned with calling out feminism than working for gender equality.  As the rules of this sub necessitate 500 characters or more, I'll go ahead and generalize wildly; I think there is a large amount of cross-over between MRAs, egalitarians, white supremacists, conspiracy theorists and antisemites. It's kind of unfortunate, because all of these ""movements"" touch on valid issues here and there, tainting the efforts of those who are legitimately trying to improve things for everyone.  For example, if I suspected that black people/white people/women/men were biologically less apt to do math/creation/teamwork/etc, and I devised an academic experiment to test this hypothesis, I would automatically be thought to work on the behalf of hate groups and be discredited - there would be no doubt that I have an agenda, because active hate groups have made those subjects effectively taboo, and anyone oblivious to these taboos are probably seeing the world through the lens of those hate groups.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a straight, white male and I self-identify as an egalitarian. I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; self-identify as a feminist, pro-LGBTA, anti-racist, and several other similar groups. I consider &lt;em&gt;all of these&lt;/em&gt; to be subsets of egalitarianism focusing on one particular type of inequality. (I also take a fairly dim view of conspiracy theorists, since you mentioned that.) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I also think MRAs -- the well-intentioned ones, not the misogynists-in-disguise -- don&amp;#39;t realize that MRM and feminism are &lt;em&gt;the same thing&lt;/em&gt;. Both are concerned with freeing people from gender roles and ensuring equal treatment regardless of which gender, if any, one identifies. It&amp;#39;s the same cause; it doesn&amp;#39;t need two different names.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; the term egalitarian, for the exact same reason you say you would: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a male feminist concerned with the rights of both genders, I must admit that the name &amp;quot;feminism&amp;quot; is really unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think what you&amp;#39;re encountering is at least partly the result of people that have yet to comprehend the various systemic disadvantages slanted against minority or discriminated groups. &amp;quot;Blacks have it easy because affirmative action!&amp;quot; might make superficial sense to someone who only sees affirmative action as an easing of the path for one group that is &lt;em&gt;otherwise equal&lt;/em&gt; to the majority (white) group. It fails to account for the pre-established systemic disadvantages faced by the minority group, which necessitate the &amp;quot;special treatment&amp;quot; in the first place. My own encounters with people that hold these sorts of views has consistently shown this to be the case and it&amp;#39;s true across a &lt;em&gt;broad&lt;/em&gt; stripe of ideologies. There are bad apples in &lt;del&gt;any&lt;/del&gt; every group driving for social change and this is no less true for egalitarians than it is for any of the groups that fall under its (very large) umbrella. Egalitarianism is simply large enough that it can encompass &lt;em&gt;all of them&lt;/em&gt;, rather than a particular stripe. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That there are &amp;quot;egalitarians&amp;quot; that sully the ideal of egalitarianism should come as no greater surprise than the existence of &amp;quot;feminists&amp;quot; that sully the goals of feminism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egalitarian simply means to imagine yourself before life, not knowing if you are going to be born poor, rich, male, female, black, white, etc. Before you know this, how would you decide society should look. Should women get special treatment? Should men be in charge? Should we take care of our sick? (you might be born one of the sick). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Egalitarian just strives that each group is treated the same. The reason various hate groups get involved or leverage egalitarian is because many laws are written to favor one group of people. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with affirmitive action. There are requirements for large companies to hire X percentage of minorities, but there is no law requiring them to hire X percentage of whites. Even though 99.9% of businesses wouldn&amp;#39;t have an issue with that, the fact that one group is treated special over another is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is an easy way to address this, and John Locke gave the answer. That is a just government must apply the law equally to all citizens. Impacts must fall on the citizens equally or fairly. Now in the case of taxes, this means a progressive tax system that no matter who you are, you pay based on income. But notice our laws for taxes isn&amp;#39;t, &amp;quot;blacks pay 5% less, Asians 1% less, and white pay full amount of taxes&amp;quot;. We don&amp;#39;t have tax brackets for different races.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So various hate groups, or just different groups, always leverage egalitarian as a rebuttal. The reason feminism is attacked, is because much of feminism aims at helping one specific group (namely women). Like the women protection act, which does provide some help for men, but without a doubt mainly helps women. It is not difficult to write men equally into these laws as well. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So these groups see bills being passed, that exclude them, be it a hate group, or any group. But Egalitarian is merely the belief that each law should equally affect all groups. The idea that we can stop and frisk you because you look foreign is breaking John Locke&amp;#39;s ideal government. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And if we want to bring up something on reddit often, look at MGM vs FGM, one is banned in all forms, considered horrific, while the other one is encouraged by the CDC. Why, when FGM was banned, didn&amp;#39;t we ban MGM? This is where MRA&amp;#39;s get upset. Laws that put children with the mother because she has a vagina. That doesn&amp;#39;t apply to all citizens equally. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I am rambling now. But Egalitarian is a method of deciding the right thing to do, various minority groups often join in because these groups see themselves as victims, and thus not being treated equally as others in the eyes of government and law. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And to be fair, I think many of these people are right. I think we have coded much bias into our laws.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0

I believe the Republican Party will die within the next 100 years and will be replaced by the Libertarian Party. CMV,"It has recently become fairly clear that the Republican Party is clearly disconnected with the younger generation.  Millennials are increasingly more skeptical of religion and very supportive of gay rights and action on climate change.  They also view the Republican Party as out of touch with reality and old fashioned.  I predict that within the next couple decades, Republicans will show a deep decline in support within the American Populace.  However, Republican backers have some very deep pockets.  Therefore, they will continue to win elections (particularly in districts where apathy is rampant and incumbents have been there for a long time) and maintain a presence for quite some time. They will ultimately accept their fate and rebrand themselves as libertarians that support common sense answers to the social issues afflicting us today.  The Republican platform has little to no merit with younger people except in terms of economic issues.  While I happen to disagree with libertarians stance, it will be far more tolerable that the GOP we see today.  CMV  &amp;#8710;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree and disagree simultaneously for a very simple reason: &lt;em&gt;political parties rarely die&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example... from 1994 to 2006, many were predicting the demise of the Democratic Party.  I mean, in that span, they lost their hold on Congress, the Presidency, etc.  They couldn&amp;#39;t even get Bush out of office in 2004 when everyone seemingly &lt;em&gt;hated&lt;/em&gt; the guy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then, they turned things around... won Congress in 2006, won the Presidency in 2008, etc.  Now it seems like the GOP is on the verge of falling apart... even though they won back the House in three years ago (2010) and have a good chance at winning influence in the Senate in the next cycle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Political parties are too entrenched to simply go away and be replaced.  They have too much money and infrastructure in place to be eliminated.  What you will typically see is a shift in platform.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example: Late 1800s to mid 1900s Democrats were pro-slavery, racist, and anti-civil rights.  In that time, the Republicans fought for civil rights and against racist laws.  Then things seemed to flip.  Why?  Demographic shifts, and more importantly: Vietnam and Social Welfare.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, the Republican Party is at a crossroads.  Their Social Conservative base is no longer mainstream or popular.  Much more importantly, it&amp;#39;s focus on using Government to advance their Social Conservative view seems contradictory to their seemingly &amp;quot;small government&amp;quot; stance.  This is compounded by their views on National Defense and Military Spending.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, aside from social views, very little of what the mainstream GOP says and practices is much different from that of the Democrats (who are also pro-government and even military use/spending) &lt;em&gt;Note, I said &amp;quot;mainstream&amp;quot; as both parties have their fringe (liberals for Dems, libertarians for Reps) elements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because there is little differentiation, the GOP is now forced to look at areas where they can retain and gain support.  It appears their &amp;quot;small government&amp;quot; platform is slowly becoming more popular and yields more electoral dividends and support than their traditional conservative social views.  More importantly, the GOP is also losing on the social conservative front, especially with respect to Gay Marriage.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the GOP is a house divided against itself.  It&amp;#39;s internal leadership is slowly changing and is representative of its actual political leadership.  The more libertarian-leaning GOP members take power in Congress and in the States, the more say they begin to have in conventions and primaries.  Eventually, traditional Republicans fall out of power (like John McCain) in lieu of newer blood (Ted Cruz). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This process takes time to begin, but eventually an inversion point happens.  This typically occurs around a Presidential Primary (possibly 2016) where you&amp;#39;ll see a coup over the existing party platform.  We had a taste of this in 2012 with Ron Paul&amp;#39;s supporters, and it is likely to happen again, with more gusto.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, no, the Republican Party will not &lt;em&gt;die&lt;/em&gt;.  It will be reborn from the ashes of its demise like the legendary Phoenix into a party that is more socially liberal (on a national scale), truly focused on Civil Liberties, and on shrinking the size of our Government and our involvement in foreign affairs (which means a smaller military).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that it is a possibility for the republican party to die. But it is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Look at the demographics of the republican leadership and the way that it will change. The older republicans like Mccain (senator Mccain not candidate Mccain) are closer to a libertarian and reasonable party that existed during the first George Bush&amp;#39;s presidency. Then there is the tea party that has infiltrated the party and has created what we see today. This is a group of 40-50 who aren&amp;#39;t anything close to what the republican party once claimed to be.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is just like how during the 70&amp;#39;s-80&amp;#39;s the democrats where taken over by a brand of young liberal that were extremists and wanted true socialist policies. The democrats where very hurt by this and it is what set the republicans up for their claim as the intellectual  practical party. The idealized Democrats hurt the party greatly, and moderates became republicans. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is what is happening in the republican party now. It has been taken over by idealists who care more about their political ideals over the actual welfare of their citizens. This is why the Democrats are likely to rule for the next decade or two. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But eventually the Democrats will over regulate and cause a slow down in the economy, another Jimmy Carter. It&amp;#39;s a cycle. The Republican conservative hands off style will fall for now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: Legislators should face punishment for passing unconstitutional laws.,"Just as an example, there have lately been a lot of laws passed restricting the ability to vote. There are (or have been) quite the assortment of laws on the books restricting various other civil rights, from voting to abortion and everything in between. As it stands, legislators with an illegitimate agenda have very little disincentive against passing unconstitutional, abusive legislation. In fact, they have every incentive to ""throw it all at the wall and see what sticks,"" passing whatever laws they feel like and hoping they don't get challenged, with no repercussions if they do get struck down, and causing plenty of harm in the meantime.  Legislators should not be doing this. It's unacceptable. It violates their oath of office. It harms citizens in the time between passage and repeal - if repeal even happens. I think that legislators should have reasons to personally fear passing such laws.  If a law is found to be unconstitutional, those who voted for it should be punished; those who co-sponsored it should be punished more harshly; and those who drafted it should be punished most harshly of all.  Give me one good reason why this shouldn't be so.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

CMV: I believe that most skeptics are simply jumping on bandwagons.,"Please read the whole post. The title does not fully encompass my view.  I believe many skeptics, or conspiracy theorists, or whatever, are pretty much people who want to convince themselves that they are smart be being able to ""see beyond"" what most people see, so they go to some place like /r/conspiracy, read a post about how fluoride in tap water is mind control or something, and accept it as truth. They have essentially jumped on a bandwagon that formed in order to combat other bandwagons. This second-degree bandwagon generally comes from an idea with little or flimsy evidence, with it's members disregarding any who do not agree as ""sheep"" or something of the sort. This whole sheep thing is extremely hypocritical, as their whole ideology is centered around questioning what you know and looking for flaws in the information you have. Many of these skeptics fail to see the flaws in what they think, and maintain a stubborn, short-sighted mentality that completely contradicts the arguments they make against others.  Edit: Of course, many skeptics are completely logical. They look at statistics, see evidence, and draw conclusions that make sense. I'm just annoyed by those that see a post, don't look at sources, and still accept something as true, even if it may be something ridiculous like 9/11 being an inside job.  Edit: Okay so apparently the definition of ""skeptic"" or ""conspiracy theorist"" is not definite among this community. Sorry about this. The point I'm trying to make is that I see people who call themselves such terms, and their ramblings seem to be less evidence and drawing conclusions and more ""I'm smart, I can see what's really happening. You're a sheep with a closed mind."" Keep in mind that *I do not believe all skeptics are like this.* _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I believe that everyone is secretly a cyborg other than me CMV,"From a young age I have always found it hard to grasp the fact that everyone has their own goals and individual minds. I find it hard because there are just so many humans for this to be happening and I can't but feel like it is uncomprehensible. I just cannot grasp the fact that this is true.  So, From this I came up with the concept that everyone is a secret cyborg without knowing they actually are themselves. I sometimes almost feel like I am a [brain in a vat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat) within some computer generated simulation.  This [gif](http://i.imgur.com/2WLJ2.gif) hit me the hardest.  I don't necessarily believe in the idea of everyone is a cyborg, it's just that can't understand how this is all possible when I look my own mind with the amount of thoughts that I am constantly bombarded with and think how is everyone else having all these thoughts at the same time.  I have no clue really but I am interested to read some of your comments guys.  Thanks.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The view that you are conscious but others are not is called solipsism. There is no absolutely convincing argument against it because we don&amp;#39;t fully understand the nature of consciousness itself (but we might someday). Yet many people in philosophy of mind still don&amp;#39;t think it is likely to be true. Here is an illustration why: even though it seems too surprising, too incomprehensible that other hunks of meat in other human heads could give rise to conscious thought, that surprising-ness is just as real with regards to the hunks of meat in our &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; heads, and yet we have first-person direct acquaintance with our conscious experience nonetheless. Step back and don&amp;#39;t think about your brain as &amp;quot;yours&amp;quot; but rather think about your brain as this physical object &amp;quot;here&amp;quot; and another person&amp;#39;s brain as that physical object &amp;quot;over there&amp;quot;. &lt;strong&gt;If you allow yourself to accept the surprising conclusion that this physical object &amp;quot;here&amp;quot; gives rise to consciousness in some way, then why not for the physical object &amp;quot;over there&amp;quot;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But suppose we are not even sure about whether the physical world is &amp;quot;really&amp;quot; there. Suppose you are a brain-in-a-vat and the other people you see are just non-sentient simulations in the computer which are complex enough to pass the Turing test and fool you but basic enough to be non-sentient. &lt;strong&gt;The earlier point nevertheless still stands:&lt;/strong&gt; your brain is experiencing a simulation, but there is still an &lt;strong&gt;outside&lt;/strong&gt; world where your brain-in-a-vat is a physical object which surprisingly gives rise to consciousness. And if you are wiling to accept that surprising fact about your physical brain &amp;quot;here&amp;quot;, hooked up to this simulating machine, then why not say the same of that other brain &amp;quot;over there&amp;quot; hooked up to another simulating machine?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Consciousness is indeed a very deep and surprising mystery to us, but it is better to think about it as a deep mystery &lt;strong&gt;about the nature of the universe&lt;/strong&gt; and not only just about this particular object between my ears.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit: formatting&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to attack your argument from the any other angle other than try to convince you that your conclusion to dismiss the experiences of others entirely is equally--if not more so--baffling to attributing it to cyborgs or brains in a vat.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First of all, just because you can&amp;#39;t comprehend how something can be so doesn&amp;#39;t mean that isn&amp;#39;t. It seems like a pretty silly view to me to say &amp;quot;welp, I can&amp;#39;t imagine that being true because it blows my mind&amp;quot; and reaching an equally radical conclusion for it. Do you have any good reasons for holding deep disbelief? After all, there&amp;#39;s times when you have very good reasons for dismissing certain thoughts or ideas but I see no argument on your part why other than your own inability to comprehend it. That&amp;#39;s an argument from ignorance and not very sound.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Next up, what makes you think that everyone being a cyborg is any more comprehensible? How did those cyborgs come to be here? How did they come to mimic your thoughts and experiences so well that you could almost be fooled for their authenticity? How is that any easier to grasp?  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or that there&amp;#39;s a computer out there that, when you go to the beach, simulates each and every grain of sand you feel on your fingers, simulates the way the sun and water feels so consistently you&amp;#39;re never suspicious that anything is awry. Just imagine the amount of power necessary to run it. How is that any more likely than hey, you&amp;#39;re actually not part of a computer simulation and there&amp;#39;s other minds around you also experiencing this world?  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Or if you&amp;#39;re the only mind to have ever existed and everyone else is just a projection. Where in the hell did you get the ideas for the shape of physical matters? Or of humans? How did that influence you? Are you truly just capable of coming up with new shapes and models at that high of a capacity? Why is it more likely that you have these incredible mental powers that have for all your life remained suspiciously absent rather than other people being as &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; as you are?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It just seems to me that you got overwhelmed and were too quick to just go to the other extreme without stopping to asses what your conclusions imply. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: When one accepts that eating meat is immoral, one would also have to accept that wild animals that naturally eat meat either need to be ""rehabilitated"", or put down.","This is almost a tongue-in-cheek CMV, but the argument still feels like it has a little bit of truth to me. Help me sort this out, would ya?  ""Animals do not know any better, so they cannot be blamed for their actions (i.e. hunting and eating other animals)""  I would think one of the premises for the existence of rehabilitation efforts in prisons, for people who once felt it was okay to injure or kill other human beings, is that criminals can effectively be taught to ""know better"". Therefore, a person who believes eating meat is immoral should feel that the same rehabilitative efforts should be made for animals who hunt other animals. As they are, it is natural for them to hunt. However, it is also natural for murderers to murder when they commit their murders. We need to change what is ""natural"" for them -- reform the animals so that they no longer feel the need to prey upon others.  Of course, aside from the fact that this sounds a bit silly, I believe it is impossible to do. This would therefore lead a person who believes eating meat is immoral to the conclusion that predatory animals need to be put down, the same way that murderers who we deem cannot be rehabilitated would be issued a death sentence. Perhaps locking up carnivorous/omnivorous animals for life-term sentences could also suffice? In any case, it would seem that severe and immediate action needs to be taken.  The only way I feel you can get around this is to find a successful way of reverting wild animals' intrinsic tendencies to hunt others. But again, I do not feel like this is a realistic possibility.  Maybe I am just a bit tired or out of it, but I am strangely and surprisingly convinced by this line of reasoning. Thoughts?  **EDIT:** Not that it was really coming up in discussion so far or anything, but I did want to mention that I am pescatarian, and also support vegetarianism and veganism. Just a bit of (possibly unnecessary) background on me, if anything.  **EDIT 2:** This might be a clearer explanation of my view:  Let's just consider Person A who believes eating meat is wrong because it takes the life of another sentient being without its consent. Animals who hunt other animals take the lives of other sentient beings without their consent. Therefore, Person A believes that these predatory animals are doing something wrong. Person A should then feel that it is right for these animals to stop doing something wrong.  This may or may not represent my stance entirely (I am not quite sure myself), but it is at least a good summary of it.  **Final EDIT:** I think I am fairly satisfied with how this CMV turned out. Thanks for all your replies! It was simply a strange thought that I felt would be fun to try to argue about, but the CMV yielded some interesting conversations, at least for me.

It was used to justify the bombing of centres of population in World War II, but more recently it has been used by terrorist organisations, especially Al Qaeda, to justify attacks on civilians including 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It has also been an argument used by Israel.  In 1982 Menachem Begin stated that Lebanese casualties of Israeli air raids were no different to those suffered by Denmark in Allied air raids in World War II.  As recently as 2006, Benjamin Netanyahu and Shimon Peres dismissed British criticism of air strikes in Lebanon by pointing out that Britain ought to understand Israel&amp;#39;s actions as it mirrored the strategy used by Bomber Command in World War II.  He even specifically drew a link between ketyusha rockets launched at Israel and the German V2 programme.  There is a patent absurdity in this particular analogy, but there is no legal or ethical justification for the targeting of civilians.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Israel is party to all 4 Geneva Conventions, the fourth of which makes specific provision for the protection of civilians.  As well as requiring a country’s actions to be proportionate, to discriminate between military and civilian facilities and to be humane, the fourth convention also states civilians are to be treated identically regardless of nationality, race, political opinion or religion.  So whilst there are questions to be asked about whether Israel’s actions are proportionate, discriminate or humane, it is obvious that under international law a civilian cannot become a target based on their political choices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;the problem i see with your argumentation is that you see hamas as a solely military organisation. palestine has been under occupation for quite some time now, and they suffered a lot under the israeli treatment (destroyed homes, killed civilians, destroyed agriculture and economy). and hamas also provides lots of social services to that region, which is effectively blocked by israel for other organisations to provide. to make this sure: i am in no way trying to justify the military wing of the hamas, and i think they are religous nationalist facists (read their charta from 1988 if you want to know what i&amp;#39;m talking about).&lt;br/&gt; but you have to see that hamas is the organisation that&amp;#39;s actually helping palestinian civilists on a broad scale and therefor do get support in the population. the thing people just ignore is that the military actions (not just portective edge, also the ones before. or every military action ever in the history of mankind for that matter) overwhelmingly hit civilians which in turn increases the influence hamas has over the population and makes people active supporters. to phrase this overexaggerate: how many relatives can you loose to airstrikes until you turn militant?  tl;dr: support for hamas isn&amp;#39;t equal to supporting the terrorist attacks or wanting a war. there are various factors that can explain the popularity of hamas and military (and civil) agression only make this worse.&lt;br/&gt; p.s. all the downvotes on this topic are stupid. learn to use the system or don&amp;#39;t use it at all. if you disagree with a topic (like i do heavily on this one) challenge the view or leave it completely. downvoting it to bury the topic doesn&amp;#39;t help anyone.&lt;br/&gt; edit: grammatical error corrected&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: We should stop worrying about lowering the number of unemployment and instead focus on creating a universal minimum living allowance,"I know this is not a popular view, but hear me out. The more technology we create the less we're going to NEED people to do certain jobs. As it stands right now unemployment raises because we (I'm speaking mostly about the United States) outsource jobs to other countries or to our technologies. This is a battle we are never going to win because technology increases exponentially. Also, population is on the raise. Meaning, we will reach a point where there will be far more people than traditional jobs. If we set up a universal minimum allowance then we can ""fix"" poverty and ""fix"" the unemployment problem. Will this allow people to be lazy? Yes. But will it also give people the freedom and choice to go after jobs they enjoy?  I think so. For example, I work retail and I actually enjoy it.   Some countries are already trying something close to this out. And as far as ""how will we pay for it?"" I believe those countries are converting their welfare programs into this new system.  Why am I wrong?  Edit: I don't think I gave this issue enough thought. Several of you have made really good points and pointed out that my reasoning was flawed. Thanks for the comments, I think my view has been changed.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your theory rests on the hypothesis that as technology increases so does unemployment. If this were true then surely we would see an ever increasing rate of unemployment since records began, at least if we could mitigate for other factors. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the changing economic policies of various governments this would be quite hard to do, but &lt;a href=""http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/780/economics/unemployment-rates-history/""&gt;these stats from the Bureau of Labour Statistics&lt;/a&gt; seem not to indicate much of an increase in unemployment since the start of the 20th century. There is a sustained spike between the Great Depression and WW2, but aside from that it looks quite stable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Without knowledge of the period it is hard for me to say why it has remained relatively even, but it doesn&amp;#39;t seem to lend much weight to your theory. While it is true that tech destroys jobs, it also creates them. I don&amp;#39;t see a reason why that creation process will change with new technology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The more technology we create the less we&amp;#39;re going to NEED people to do certain jobs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Certain jobs but the same technology also created labor demand elsewhere. Throughout history all technology &amp;amp; automation has resulted in higher net labor demand not lower so why do you presume that increased automation will reduce labor demand without any evidence to support that point?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;As it stands right now unemployment raises because we (I&amp;#39;m speaking mostly about the United States) outsource jobs to other countries or to our technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Incorrect. Outsourcing simply changes the local skills that are in demand (shifts them up), outsourcing creates upwards pressure on both skills and wages.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unemployment is a cyclic issue (IE occurs due to the business cycle) and each time we reach the peak of the boom we end up beating the previous record for labor shortage.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, population is on the raise. Meaning, we will reach a point where there will be far more people than traditional jobs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Incorrect. Population is expected to peak at around 11b in 2060 before falling to around 6b. In advanced economies we are already seeing this occur demographically with an aging population, the proportion of adult workers to retirees is changing such that there are fewer workers for every retiree which in the coming decades is going to put immense pressure on labor; we are going to have labor shortages in nearly all industries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will this allow people to be lazy?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Setting it up as an NIT would allow you to escape this problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some countries are already trying something close to this out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US was the first country in the world to have such a system its called the Earned Income Tax Credit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And as far as &amp;quot;how will we pay for it?&amp;quot; I believe those countries are converting their welfare programs into this new system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The cost of a universal basic income are far in excess of existing forms of cash-transfer in the US, we would need to raise an additional $1.5t in revenue to afford such a program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"Fat people are disgusting, CMV","Yes, it's been done before. I read the threads and none of them changed my view.  I used to be fat when I was younger. I made a long and hard effort to change that. Going to the gym, working out and running helped to make me thinner, and now I'm a normal weight. For the majority of overweight and obese people, it isn't medical factors controlling it, it's weak self control. And I wouldn't have gained the self control if it weren't for a little teasing/bullying as a kid.   Why shouldn't we be able to shame fat people? I'm not saying necessarily to their face, that's just dickish to do to anyone really, but why should being fat be accepted?   Not to mention overeating which can be solved if you had willpower to just watch what you eat.   Another thing: When people say fat people have a beautiful face [like this girl](http://np.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/1jjp72/plussized_model_interview_starts_out_awkward/), I don't know why but I can't stand it. I can't see her as beautiful because of the very unappealing body, it's like her face is doesn't matter at all and all I see is a grossly misshapen body.  I can't think of any more points to really make right now, but please, change my view. I know it's an opinion of an asshole, and I'd like to accept people but I can't. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re right, being obese isn&amp;#39;t healthy for a person at all. Not physically, mentally or emotionally. But, how you decide to treat an obese person can make a world of difference. There are other reasons for a persons obesity besides lack of control where food is concerned. Sometimes, when a person (anyone really) decides to eat for any reason other than to provide fuel for their body it&amp;#39;s a symptom of other issues. Some people over eat to soothe their emotions. They use the food as a buffer or comfort from their emotional distress. For these people, the food isn&amp;#39;t the issue. It&amp;#39;s the emotions underneath it all. Some people eat out boredom or to distract themselves from painful memories. Being obese goes a lot deeper than just having some will power. But if you&amp;#39;re trying to motivate an obese person to loose weight, you have to remember that not every method will be effective for all. It&amp;#39;s true that some people may respond to shaming as a wake up call to take control of their heath, but the majority will not. You also need to examine your own motives for thinking this way. Do you shame them out of genuine concern for their health or because you&amp;#39;re horrified that you were once overweight as well? If you&amp;#39;re doing it because you care then that&amp;#39;s great, but find a more positive/constructive way to encourage them. If not, then obese people don&amp;#39;t need that kind of &amp;#39;help&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you think people who are ugly should be shamed for being ugly?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More to the point: why &lt;em&gt;shouldn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; being fat be accepted?  Sure there are &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; health risks being associated with being morbidly obese, but slightly overweight?  And why would health risks even matter?  Why do you care about someone&amp;#39;s health, and why would that give you the right to &lt;em&gt;shame&lt;/em&gt; them?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the majority of overweight and obese people, it isn&amp;#39;t medical factors controlling it, it&amp;#39;s weak self control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I buy this.  I&amp;#39;d imagine that for &lt;em&gt;the majority&lt;/em&gt; of overweight people, it&amp;#39;s having a unfortunately low metabolism in a culture where the cheapest and most readily available food are incredibly unhealthy.  Besides this, you can&amp;#39;t possibly know, for any given fat person, whether they are so because of how they were born or because of how they eat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And I wouldn&amp;#39;t have gained the self control if it weren&amp;#39;t for a little teasing/bullying as a kid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For most people, shaming them has the opposite effect, and can even drive them to suicide.  There are far better motivational forces than shame.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why shouldn&amp;#39;t we be able to shame fat people? I&amp;#39;m not saying necessarily to their face, that&amp;#39;s just dickish to do to anyone really, but why should being fat be accepted?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Probably because someone being fat affects you &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt;.  And really, it&amp;#39;s asymmetrical judgement, since nowhere near the amount of shame levied towards fat people are levied towards skinny or underweight people.  Western cultural standards would rather have someone be unhealthily underweight than unhealthily overweight, or overweight at all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, your penultimate paragraph is irrelevant.  Beauty isn&amp;#39;t an objective measurement, and you can&amp;#39;t decide that because &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; find someone&amp;#39;s body unappealing that they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; unappealing.  Where you see a &amp;quot;grossly misshapen&amp;quot; body, someone else might see a beautiful one.  And besides, why do you even care?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"The feminist community inflates what I consider to be trivial needs of trans* people, CMV","I'm afraid I didn't know how to write a title that really encapsulates what I'm struggling with here, so this might not be what you expect. I just read this old blog post:  http://a-little-bi-furious.tumblr.com/post/57944697694/fauxmosexualtranstrender-kristyest  I happen to be a cis straight white male so of course I'm probably misguided in my thoughts. I just wonder how the cis person being ridiculed here is really in the wrong. When she is told that she shouldn't get a free binder so that someone that really *needs* it is not deprived of one, I feel like that might be taking things to unnecessary extremes.  The argument is that because of possible gender dysphoria, these material items are vital to trans* people while they are only mere playthings for cis people. Now I can't imagine what it must be like to be trans* but I do know that I and many other cis people have all got problems with how we look. Mainstream society can make people feel awfully bad for all sorts of different physical appearances. But if we were raised in a warm, encouraging environment, we were taught to accept the body we were born with and love ourselves no matter what others thought. I get the feeling that it is looked down upon somewhat to be so insecure as to *require* cosmetic alterations (e.g. breast implants, toupees etc.) and not be happy with what you've got. Thus it would seem a luxury to me both for the cosplay cis person and the trans* person to have these binders, just as plastic surgery is a luxury to people who feel they must have perfect, celebrity-like bodies.  That said, I would like to have the more morally upstanding opinion on this matter and thus request that someone tells me why I should be 100% on the side of the trans* people in this case.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the issue here is that you are looking at cis people wanting the binders because they are also suffering from low self-esteem. I don&amp;#39;t think the trans person is complaining because someone else with body image issues are trying to get a hold of an item (a binder) to help them, but because these people are trying to get a hold of an item that will help them with a fun activity. (Cos-playig.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From the trans perspective it&amp;#39;s like a rich person trying to win a lifetime supply of food, so that they can then use that food to make an art sculpture, as opposed to that food going to a poor starving person so they can eat it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As the people mentioned cos-playing is very expensive, so those individuals probably have money, and it is just more of a hobby. It might help their self-esteem if they have low self-esteem, but their very life is not dependent upon winning a free binder. This is the case for many young trans individuals. They may be too young to have a job, their parents may not support them, and this is the only way they can be themselves. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps understanding what transgendered is will also help. There is a difference between being transgendered and having self-esteem issues. Studies have shown trans individuals brains are actually more like the gender they identify with, than what their anatomy is. (There are actual physical differences between male and female brains.) The only affective treatment for trans people is often to get surgery. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For individuals that suffer from things like body dysmorphia this is not the case. Surgery does not solve their problems, and they often keep going back to get bigger boobs, a bigger butt, or whatever. For these individuals therapy is the only affective treatment because their problem is mental. Trans people&amp;#39;s issue is not a mental one but a physical one. (Male brain, female body, or female brain, male body.) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So trans have a medical condition that the only solution is to make their body match their brain. A binder may be the only treatment for such a thing as surgery is very expensive. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So you might see clearer now the importance of it. It isn&amp;#39;t trans people angry because other people have self-esteem issues. It&amp;#39;s because other people are taking away their only hope of temporary treatment for a very real medical problem that most of society won&amp;#39;t even acknowledge (depending upon what country you live in..), and they are taking away their temporary medical treatment for a hobby, something that is extra just for their pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;edit: to add to the importance part, there is an extremely high suicide rate among trans individuals. This is why something like a binder really can be a life or death situation. This is not the case for cosplayers. They do not commit suicide because their outfit wasn&amp;#39;t the best it could be, but many trans individuals have killed themselves because every day they have to go about as something they are not, be treated as someone they are not, they have to live in and feel their body that is wrong every single day. So in a contest giving away old binders to trans people, the trans people needs out weight that of a cosplayer because it isn&amp;#39;t just someone&amp;#39;s happiness at stake, it is their life.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To check that I understand, is your argument that trans* people&amp;#39;s transitioning is an unnecessary luxury, just as cosplaying is? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To continue using this example, there is a vast difference between dressing up for a hobby and suffering from &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity_disorder""&gt;Gender Identity Disorder&lt;/a&gt;. Wikipedia (which I&amp;#39;m using for simplicity&amp;#39;s sake, but I&amp;#39;m sure there are alternative sources if needed) says:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms of GID in children include disgust at their own genitalia, social isolation from their peers, anxiety, loneliness and depression... Adults with GID are at increased risk for stress, isolation, anxiety, depression, poor self-esteem and suicide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Which I imagine are very different from the symptoms of your cosplaying not being quite as accurate as you&amp;#39;d prefer. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the free binders were - presumably - intended for poorer trans* individuals to be able to relieve some of the symptoms of their dysmorphia. If you had a condition which was causing you such deep distress and someone offered you a means of potentially helping to ease some of that distress, isn&amp;#39;t it understandable that you would be upset at someone who is not suffering in any way taking that means so that they can do a hobby a little bit better? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is a luxury for a trans* person to allievate their gender dysphoria. Poor trans* people may not be able to at all, depending on where they live, but they&amp;#39;ll suffer for not having that &amp;#39;luxury&amp;#39; whereas the cosplayers will not suffer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
I don't see the point of feminism in the West. CMV,"Feminism seems to me to be about acquiring equal legal rights for women... In the West, where this is already a thing, why do we need feminism?

If eliminating intangible prejudice, why not go the way of humanism, where you would be fighting for the rights of all? This is not to say that feminism should be looked down on, or no longer a thing. It definitely helped women in the West and similar success in the Middle East would be awesome. But I believe that the movement has achieved it's goal in the West. So why continue?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Feminism seems to me to be about acquiring equal legal rights for women... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is not complete, it&amp;#39;s not just about legal rights, it&amp;#39;s about not being stereotyped or mistreated based on gender as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People are, for example, much more likely to hire men for jobs, or to pay men more. Studies have been done where identical resumes were sent to companies, identical except some had male names and some female. The ones with male names got callbacks at a significantly higher rate. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are many other examples as well, like the &amp;quot;bechdel test&amp;quot; of movies and entertainment media. To pass the test, a movie needs to have at least two women in it who talk to each other about something besides a man. 50% of movies fail this test. Can you think of a single one that would fail if the genders were reversed? More evidence of the under representation of women in our culture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not to mention, there are rights issues as well, feminists are constantly fighting for contraceptive rights, as there are non-stop efforts to repeal roe vs. wade, or to ban morning after pill, or make it more difficult to get birth control, etc, etc. There is even the recent Texas ID law that created voting difficulties for 30% of women in texas (and only %1 of men)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;understand that women face prejudice, but so do guys, albeit in a different manner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s like saying why feed the homeless in this country, if there are homeless hungry in another country too! Just because men have problems doesn&amp;#39;t mean we shouldn&amp;#39;t solve women&amp;#39;s problems. Men&amp;#39;s and women&amp;#39;s problems are different, and it takes different efforts and education to fix them. Feminism is the focus on the issues women have.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If eliminating intangible prejudice, why not go the way of humanism, where you would be fighting for the rights of all?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because &amp;quot;Humanism&amp;quot; is not the name of a movement, it&amp;#39;s just a word. You could call it &amp;quot;egalitarianism&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;gender fairness&amp;quot; or whatever you want. Feminism is obviously a sub-catagory within &amp;quot;egalitarianism&amp;quot;. You&amp;#39;re allowed to have subcatagories. You wouldn&amp;#39;t tell a botanist that they should only refer to themselves as a &amp;quot;scientist&amp;quot;, or a baseball player that they should only call themselves a &amp;quot;sports player.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Feminism is a long list of concepts and causes, and criticising the word &amp;quot;feminism&amp;quot; is done typically by people who don&amp;#39;t just want to rename the movement, which would accomplish nothing of consequence, but by people who object to all of the concepts and causes the feminism stands for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no rule of feminism that a feminist can only care about women. In fact, most feminists are very vocal in the rights and treatment of men as well as GLBT people. Being a feminist is something you can do in addition to being a supporter of male rights and freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I believe that the movement has achieved it&amp;#39;s goal in the West. So why continue?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because there are women who believe it&amp;#39;s not reached it&amp;#39;s goal.

CMV: It's futile to tackle extremism without fixing or replacing capitalism.,"I'll speak from experience here. I have a postgraduate education from two top 100 global universities and yet still am stuck in an entry-level job where I am expected to work a full week and be on call 24/7. I have even looked to get out of my industry and even the US but unfortunately am losing hope that the economy is any better anywhere less. Plus, my culture deeply frowns on people who don't have materialistic goals and who don't want to work for a capitalist slave driver. As such, I am increasingly radical and am being attracted to Russia, ISIS, radical Marxists, and European nationalists. The evidence shows that I'm not alone; I have been unable to date as every woman my age is working her butt off just to pay the bills. Statistics show that this is a global trend; most people are worse off absolutely than they were in 2010 as global capitalism runs rampant and even the nations that did things right like Sweden are under pressure. Injustice, not poverty, is the breeding ground of terror  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

You seem to think that if Capitalism was foolproof, these other ways of life wouldn&amp;#39;t be as appealing. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well you are basically saying an alternative to Capitalism is going to interest you, because Capitalism is flawed. I&amp;#39;d ask you though, what about the costs of taking on those other ideologies. Being different doesn&amp;#39;t mean better, and I&amp;#39;m hard-pressed to see how any of those ideologies would fix the issues you have with Capitalism. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you think following ISIS is going to help you in the date department, you must not know about becoming a slave-wife. If you think Marxism is going to help with your employment opportunity, go look at the countries that have tried to employ it to some extent. I don&amp;#39;t know about you, but North Korea and the former USSR don&amp;#39;t look so appealing. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You say most people are worse off than they were in 2010. Do you think people joining ISIS or the other alternatives are better off than you are in 2015? Sure maybe the global market is in a shaky spot, but it&amp;#39;s still way better than the alternative. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From your title (but you haven&amp;#39;t said much to defend it) you are saying that if we want to fix the extremist problem we need to fix Capitalism.  This thought isn&amp;#39;t all that wrong. It is based on the premise that those choosing extremism are doing so because Capitalism has failed them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d ask you to defend that claim though. I would argue that more people are drawn to Extremism due to other motives. Such as religious ideology, anarchism &amp;amp; anti-western culture. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How can you say that isn&amp;#39;t their real motive? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Do you think if we strive for a more secular society that we could tackle extremism? Or is only fixing the problems with Capitalism the solution?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think this is a multifaceted issue and putting all the blame on Capitalism is too convenient, especially without the needed evidence to support such a claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the question, &amp;quot;Is it more effective to tackle extremism by tackling extremist organizations or by improving the standard of living and spiritual well-being of ordinary people?&amp;quot; is a great one. A detailed and satisfying answer is outside the scope of this subreddit. But I can offer some preliminary considerations:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why frame the question vis à vis capitalism? Unless you think there is something specific about the malaise of capitalism as opposed to malaise in feudal or socialist societies that produces extremism, this seems like the wrong frame for the question. It sounds like a social change that got you laid would make you less extremist, whether that was a social change that made society more capitalistic, less capitalistic, or was skew to economic organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems possible to do &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; at the same time - just like we normally treat both the symptoms of a disease and the disease itself. Letting extremists run around France or Denmark with Kalashnikovs is pointless if we can prevent that easily; and letting people be unemployed is pointless if we could prevent &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;. Just because we can&amp;#39;t agree on a plan for reducing malaise and therefore reducing the pool of potential extremists doesn&amp;#39;t mean we shouldn&amp;#39;t minimize damage caused by existing extremists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the issues you lump together seem very heterogeneous. European nationalists and Marxists are people whose political platforms I wouldn&amp;#39;t support, but who have some valid concerns and generally seem able to participate in democratic politics. Russia is a sovereign nation controlled by an authoritarian clique which has invaded one of its neighbors. ISIS is a paramilitary force fighting for control of a vaguely defined region in Mesopotamia, with ties to terrorist groups throughout the Middle East and Europe. Why would social malaise affect support for these four entities in the same way, and why would we treat them as one, homogenous problem?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, you say:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Statistics show that this is a global trend; most people are worse off absolutely than they were in 2010 as global capitalism runs rampant and even the nations that did things right like Sweden are under pressure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Links?

"CMV: There is only one ""right"" way to play the Mass Effect series (spoilers)","*for title clarification, I am NOT referring to either of the paragon or renegade affiliations as the main topic for this post*  The Mass Effect games, however flawed though they may be, are some of my favorite games of all time. Now that my bias is clear, I want to say that the completely irrational anger that you may see in the post below IS the reason I'd like my view changed. I apologize for offending anyone and for sounding like an ass. Needless to say, this post is really only meant for those who've played the series, but if you're not afraid of spoilers then feel free to chime in.   So here's the brunt of my CMV: If you let any one of your squadmates die, (unless their deaths are unavoidable) you are:  a.) incompetent   Talk to squadmates semi-regularly, do the loyalty missions, buy the ship upgrades, and -for Gaben's sake- put some points into persuade (you Neanderthal!), and don't make stupid (YES STUPID) choices during the final ME2 mission. It's really not that difficult with a little common sense! RNG killed Mordin during the suicide mission? RELOAD A DAMN SAVE. It's worth it dammit!   b.) rushing/missing the damn point of the game  Don't give me that ""I don't have time"" crap; you bought an RPG! You're already taking a good bit time to play the game, so why not take a little more and immerse yourself in the sexy sci-fi universe you paid good money for? You get so much more out of the experience if you just take the time to explore.  c.) unfit to fairly criticize the series  Firstly, I want to say that I do agree with most of the criticisms of the plot and that it could have been much better than what it was (see the original Kapysharn plot outline for details). However despite its shortcomings, I believe that the real heart of the Mass Effect franchise lies not with the story or the narrative, but with its characters. With only a couple exceptions, the vast majority of Shepard's crew are interesting, fleshed-out characters, each with their own flaws and redeeming qualities.   For example, (SPOILERS ME3) seeing Wrex grow from a mere gun-for-hire in ME1 to the responsible, yet still badass leader of the Genophage-free Krogan in ME3 was one of the most gratifying experiences of my gaming career. Similarly, the leap of faith Shepard takes when trusting Legion on Rannoch, thus ending hundreds of years of conflict and bringing the Quarians and Geth together was immensely satisfying and could easily qualify for /r/frission material.   Without these experiences, yeah, Mass Effect 3 didn't live up to the hype. How could it? It's such a hollow victory watching Wreav royally screw things up, or watching Tali commit suicide. In my opinion, it's a complete waste of the player's time going about it that way. Regardless of paragon or renegade alignment, I believe there is one right way to play Mass Effect: a completionist run where NO ONE dies.     I need help guys. It's getting to the point where I can't even discuss Mass Effect with others without judging someone for letting my favorite characters bite the bullet. Hell, I've put one of my friends off playing the games because I was backseat-gaming during his playthrough.  I WANT to believe that games should be played however the player wants to play them, but for whatever reason it's different for me when it comes to Mass Effect in particular. Please, CMV!  EDIT: Just wanted to say that I don't take issue with making an intentionally flawed Shepard to see what it looks like. It's just I feel that some who were more critical of the game could've missed out on an important and fulfilling character later on because I a mistake, and that could have potentially negatively color their views and the public perception of the game as a whole.   Bah, apologies! I'm rambling, it's late, but I look forward to catching up with your comments tomorrow first thing! Thanks guys!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;don&amp;#39;t make stupid (YES STUPID) choices during the final ME2 mission. It&amp;#39;s really not that difficult with a little common sense! RNG killed Mordin during the suicide mission? RELOAD A DAMN SAVE. It&amp;#39;s worth it dammit!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first time I played through ME2, I lost Thane on the very first decision.  Need someone stealthy to infiltrate some ventilation?  The dude is one of the greatest assassins in the galaxy, surely he&amp;#39;s up for some infiltration!  Nope.  He died.  Had I known it was more of a &amp;quot;techy&amp;quot; assignment and not a &amp;quot;stealth&amp;quot; assignment, I may have chosen differently.  But the game did not make that clear, and I stand by my decision at the time with the information I had available.  It wasn&amp;#39;t a stupid decision.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;RELOAD A DAMN SAVE&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If failure means so little to you, you&amp;#39;re missing out on a big aspect of intensity games have to offer.  Failure with real consequences is a lot scarier than failure with no consequence.  Fear of failure is what makes our victories satisfying.  There&amp;#39;s a great episode of the Twilight Zone called &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nice_Place_to_Visit""&gt;A Nice Place to Visit&lt;/a&gt; that offers an interesting take on this, I recommend it!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, Maybe I have to go in to the next game down a character or two, but you&amp;#39;ll never experience the palm-sweating, gut wrenching intensity I get to experience when I play my games, because my choices &lt;em&gt;matter.&lt;/em&gt;  You may as well be playing with cheat codes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To put it in perspective, after Thane died and the next decision came up... I sat rocking in my chair for probably 10 minutes, juggling ideas and mentally playing through every possible outcome.  It was agony.  And it made it all the sweeter when I didn&amp;#39;t lose anyone else.  I&amp;#39;m sad for you, as you never got to experience that sweet, sweet torture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I agree with most of your other points, except the stuff like this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s such a hollow victory watching Wreav royally screw things up, or watching Tali commit suicide. In my opinion, it&amp;#39;s a complete waste of the player&amp;#39;s time going about it that way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How can you say something like that?!  Some of the most popular stories of all time are &lt;strong&gt;tragedies!&lt;/strong&gt;  The ME series actually gives you the chance not just to watch one unfold, but to &lt;em&gt;actively participate.&lt;/em&gt;  People may find, say, &lt;em&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt; to be a great tragic story... but nothing compares with seeing a beloved character die and knowing &lt;em&gt;it&amp;#39;s your fault this happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;#39;re approaching the series like a gamer, and not like someone who&amp;#39;s interested in being told a great story.  While most games reward the former, Mass Effect was designed to accommodate the latter, as well.  Stop trying to &amp;quot;win&amp;quot; or be &amp;quot;optimal&amp;quot; and enjoy the roller-coaster of emotions the series can send you on, if you let it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you just like plots and characters and different stories. I&amp;#39;d say my approach was different - if the material is in the game, it&amp;#39;s there for a purpose. It was there to be seen by players and to be experienced by them. And sometimes, tragedies are more fun than victories. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I did do the completionist run! I had a closeted gay paragon Shepard because I thought it was hilarious and he eventually shacked up with Kaidan, saved the world, let no one die, then picked destroy ending because why not. It went - well, okay, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, after that, I wanted some real emotional punches. I was &lt;em&gt;pissed as hell&lt;/em&gt; at the &lt;a href=""http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17ik93m5xahnwpng/original.png""&gt;ME3 ending&lt;/a&gt; (and I don&amp;#39;t think, as another fan, you&amp;#39;ll need me to elaborate on why - I loved those characters and I hated how little involvement they had in how things went, and the ending was a total slap in the face to the player and all their work until that point) so I thought you know what, I want a Shepard where this kind of ending makes sense. Where an ending that&amp;#39;s a fuck you to everything Shepard&amp;#39;s been trying comes as the topping of a fuck you in the chain of everything that Shepard&amp;#39;s done. Where it isn&amp;#39;t a betrayal of all the themes that have been brought up so far but the logical extension of them instead.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And so I made the world&amp;#39;s giantest asshole most self-justifying Shepard. And if you ask me? It&amp;#39;s about as far as you can get from &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; completionist Shepard, but taken with ME3&amp;#39;s ending, I think it makes for a far better story. A renegade lady who wasn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;xenophobic&lt;/em&gt; as much as &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; pro-human, straight but distrusted Jacob and uninterested in any of the alien male love interests (and who killed Kaidan in ME1, woops). Who was alone from start to end in a quest that only she seemed to really believe in. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Trust me, when you play a character who&amp;#39;s a lot more of an asshole but who&amp;#39;s a really &lt;em&gt;determined&lt;/em&gt; asshole, who keeps losing stuff and who has people die but who convinces herself that it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;worth&lt;/em&gt; something, that her mission has to be worth all that, who is willing to make sacrifices that she believes are necessary (when you, the player, know that they aren&amp;#39;t) - the &amp;#39;bad ends&amp;#39; in ME3 make for a fantastic experience. It&amp;#39;s basically the game going &amp;#39;well Shepard, you fucked up, and this is what you get for it&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re not hollow at all, they&amp;#39;re fantastic. The entire game and story turns into Shepard realizing too late that things could&amp;#39;ve been different and that the state of the universe going to shit is on &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;. They lose everyone who trusted them in some way or another, and &lt;em&gt;hurt&lt;/em&gt; through it all. The finale of ME3 goes from a completely unsatisfying throughly annoying ending that ignored the themes of choice and self-determination that had been going on through the game into one final, desperate chance to make it right, instead. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whatever Shepard picks, I felt a lot more satisfied with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; story as a whole instead of the &amp;#39;no one dies&amp;#39; run where it didn&amp;#39;t really matter that no one died and that they worked so fucking hard for that - just pick choice A, B or C and that&amp;#39;s your ending for you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Shitty failure Shepard&amp;#39;s ending was also a dialogue choice, but that just underscored that she&amp;#39;d burned and destroyed anything else around her - that no one else would stand by her side, that everyone was dead and this was all she had left. To me, that kind of ending fit much better with the way I&amp;#39;d played her, and I felt far more vicious satisfaction putting that sort of character through it. Every other &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; ending that could&amp;#39;ve been, she&amp;#39;d gone and wrecked through her own shitty actions. Losing all the choices at the end made &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt;, this time, in the context of her experiences.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I still enjoyed the everyone-lives playthrough, but I&amp;#39;d say that the &amp;#39;everyone dies&amp;#39; route, seeing as it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; there, also was meant to be played and in fact works pretty well as an overall story where Shepard is the one that&amp;#39;s screwed up the whole way. I don&amp;#39;t think of it as &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; killing of those characters off, it&amp;#39;s whatever Shepard I&amp;#39;m playing in that particular runthrough that&amp;#39;s doing it - a vicious, angry, bitter and ultimately futile Shepard. The emotional payoff on finishing the series went from &amp;#39;are you serious is that actually the ending, the fuck&amp;#39; to &amp;#39;HAHA YES, Shepard fucking deserved that, that was &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;TL;DR: The right way to play it is to experience everything that is there, and then figure out what makes you the most satisfied. For me, that wasn&amp;#39;t a completionist run. I can play as &amp;#39;saves everyone&amp;#39; Shepard and also as &amp;#39;total stupid asshole&amp;#39; Shepard - neither of them are me-the-player, they&amp;#39;re just the main characters in their own stories. The one I find the most hilarious and interesting is the one whose story makes the most sense as a whole, and that&amp;#39;s the one where Shepard totally fails save anyone, including herself. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Also, OP, if you&amp;#39;re complaining that people who let companions die miss out on content later in the game, you should consider that as a person who played through ME several times (these weren&amp;#39;t actually my only Shepards, I have also tried every romance because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about), I&amp;#39;ve actually experienced far more of it than you have. The &amp;#39;but you see less of it if you do this other route&amp;#39; ignores that you can just &lt;em&gt;play the game again&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0

"CMV: Marriage is between one man and one woman, because Marriage is intrinsically religious. The word Marriage should be removed from Government and changed to something around ""Civil Union"".","Marriage as a word comes from the Middle english word *mariage*, which according to sources from Wikipedia, comes from around 1200-1300 CE. Word comes from another Old French word then to a Latin word *marītāre*, which describes a husband and wife. Adding on top of that, many modern religions using the word to describe the ceremony as a marriage between one man and one woman, I see that the word Marriage is intrinsically religious.   Now moving to modern day, Marriage is changing as many people are adding to/changing the meaning to a word that many people use as a religious word. People are getting up in arms about these and I can see their points. Marriage in a lot of religions these days is still defined as one man and one woman. Now have a court/government adding to/changing that definition of that word, this is where I believe the whole issue is. The issue with people not wanting gay marriage based off religious beliefs is because a word is being used for something that it does not mean to them. Marriage is/from religion and should keep it that way. We need to rename Marriage in the government to remove this part of the issue that the anti-gay marriage community has with it.    Now I know it still won't remove the whole problem that the anti-gay community has with gay marriage but I believe it will remove everyone who dislikes that this word, that is so entrenched in religion, is being redefined by a government decision. I even see a huge problem with these, I am not religious and completely for two consenting people getting married, no matter who/what they are. The government needs to change its vocabulary so that when you want your union to be legal, you go get a Civil Union(Or whatever we call it) from the government. But if you want to get married, you must find a religion that accepts your union. This returns marriage to Religion and I believe removes a huge part of the problems we are having in the acceptance of this practice.    [Source of Etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage#Etymology)  HUGE EDIT: So /u/awa64 and /u/cptal has brought to my attention some information. The intrinsic nature of the word marriage that I was bringing up has some flaws. The act of marriage seems to have been more of a social thing rather than a religious thing off the bat. The church seemed to basically be the best at keeping records and the sacrament didn't come until later. So even though the nature of the word has been pretty much a religious definition for a while, the word itself is not intrinsically religious. [Here](http://www.sexarchive.info/ATLAS_EN/html/history_of_marriage_in_western.html) and [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1awx09/does_marriage_really_have_its_roots_in_religion/c91ik9s) are their sources they brought to me.   So with further communications with others, I have been bringing up that society is changing the word marriage and my view is more of a fix to speed up that change at least on the religious vs government front. The word will change in society but that takes a long time. As /u/GAB104 and a few others pointed out, that religion has change a bit from what it used to be. The whole owning your wife and stuff seems to come up a lot. So my view has changed a little but I still view that changing the government wording to something else would be a good thing to do as to remove the current problems that many religious people(That care about the issue) have with the definition of that word being changed. Here in this comment, I quickly chat about my experience with Mormons that have issues with gay marriage: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3df9or/cmv_marriage_is_between_one_man_and_one_woman/ct4n55g  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Word comes from another Old French word then to a Latin word marītāre, which describes a husband and wife. Adding on top of that, many modern religions using the word to describe the ceremony as a marriage between one man and one woman, I see that the word Marriage is intrinsically religious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The word marriage is just a word. It isn&amp;#39;t intrinsically &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. It means whatever we&amp;#39;ve collectively decided it means, and for quite some time now it&amp;#39;s been used to describe a romantic union, especially from a legal standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t care what modern religious people use for their words. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything to me, since I am not religious.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now moving to modern day, Marriage is changing as many people are adding to/changing the meaning to a word that many people use as a religious word. People are getting up in arms about these and I can see their points. Marriage in a lot of religions these days is still defined as one man and one woman. Now have a court/government adding to/changing that definition of that word, this is where I believe the whole issue is. The issue with people not wanting gay marriage based off religious beliefs is because a word is being used for something that it does not mean to them. Marriage is/from religion and should keep it that way. We need to rename Marriage in the government to remove this part of the issue that the anti-gay marriage community has with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The government isn&amp;#39;t changing the definition of anything. It&amp;#39;s simply allowing gay people to operate under the umbrella of marriage like straight people already do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re religious and you have your own definition for marriage, well bully for you! But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you get to own the word. It just means you have your own definition for it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now I know it still won&amp;#39;t remove the whole problem that the anti-gay community has with gay marriage but I believe it will remove everyone who dislikes that this word, that is so entrenched in religion, is being redefined by a government decision. I even see a huge problem with these, I am not religious and completely for two consenting people getting married, no matter who/what they are. The government needs to change its vocabulary so that when you want your union to be legal, you go get a Civil Union(Or whatever we call it) from the government. But if you want to get married, you must find a religion that accepts your union. This returns marriage to Religion and I believe removes a huge part of the problems we are having in the acceptance of this practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is wholly unnecessary. Religious people simply need to get over it, they don&amp;#39;t own the word. If I want to buy two rats and give them a marriage ceremony and go around calling them married I am free to do so. They can&amp;#39;t stop me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But frankly, every time civil unions come up those same religious folks are against it. This &amp;quot;debate&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t about the word marriage at all - that&amp;#39;s just a way to make it look like your real problem isn&amp;#39;t with gay people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The issue with people not wanting gay marriage based off religious beliefs is because a word is being used for something that it does not mean to them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marriage is/from religion and should keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_on_same-sex_marriage#Religious_support""&gt;Many religious institutions do support same-sex marriages&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#39;t believe that religious views about this matter are as consistent as you think.

It means &amp;quot;more&amp;quot; somehow than civil union. I don&amp;#39;t know why, but that seems to be the case.

CMV: there is no legal or moral argument against allowing incestuous marriage that hasn't been thrown away in pursuit of gay marriage.,"To start: **I am *not* saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing.**  However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there's some psychological affliction behind it, but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well, but psychologists realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course, any religious objections are right out.  So with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled, I'm left without any good reason why siblings should marry each other. CMV  Edit 1: Added emphasis.  Edit 2: Stepping away for a bit. I'll be back in a few hours. (8:45pm, GMT)  Edit 3: Deltas awarded to: /u/SquirrelPower for pointing out that there is a legal difference between types of classes. /u/the-friendzoner made a similar argument, that the sexual attraction of incest is different than an orientation.   I don't consider these sufficient reasons to continue the ban, but they are distinct from the reasons given for banning homosexuality, so they fulfill the terms of my post.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

So, in that sense, I understand why you want to dismiss that factor altogether. However, there&amp;#39;s a substantial line between a homosexual couple and an incestuous heterosexual one: the former can have sex or not have sex, but no matter what, their sexual lives will not impact the lives of anyone else; the latter, however, will result in a significantly higher chance of producing a child with a lower quality-of-life. True, marriage does not equal procreation, but by sanctioning that relationship, the government would be supporting a relationship that may negatively impact the lives of their future offspring. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I imagine a common argument to this might be that we allow marriage for individuals who knowingly have a higher genetic chance of passing on an abnormal trait, but we cannot simply disallow marriage entirely for one person. Similarly, it&amp;#39;s wrong to ban marriage of an entire sexual orientation. People have the right to fall in love and get married. However, that is not the same as banning the marriage of an incestuous couple, as those individuals can still fall in love within their desired orientation, outside of the family, and get married in a relationship that will statistically produce healthier children. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main problem with your argument is that gays are a &lt;em&gt;class&lt;/em&gt; of people, while people with incestuous feelings are just individuals with incestuous feelings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Basically, it is wrong to discriminate against people simply because they belong to a specific group. It is, however, perfectly OK to discriminate against individuals because of their individual traits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspect_classification#Federal_classifications""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; are some of the legal definitions of what constitutes a &amp;#39;class&amp;#39; of people. I&amp;#39;m not going to summarize &amp;#39;em. You have to do some work and read &amp;#39;em yourself. But the two main groups are the suspect classes and the rational-basis classes. &lt;em&gt;Suspect&lt;/em&gt; classes include race or religion, and the government needs to show a compelling reason to allow discrimination. &lt;em&gt;Rational-basis&lt;/em&gt; classes are groups like criminals vs. non-criminals, where there may be a rational reason to allow discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two choice quotes:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Perry v. Schwarzenegger, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in its Findings of Fact commented that sexual orientation could be considered a &lt;strong&gt;suspect&lt;/strong&gt; class[...]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Striking down Section 3 of DOMA as unconstitutional in Windsor v. United States (2012), the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals held sexual orientation to be a &lt;strong&gt;quasi-suspect&lt;/strong&gt; classification&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here you have the courts arguing over which kind of classification that gays belong to (&lt;em&gt;suspect&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;quasi-suspect&lt;/em&gt; class) but agreeing that gays do belong to something stronger than just a rational-basis classification.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Siblings with incestuous feelings? I guarantee they would fall under the &amp;#39;rational-basis&amp;#39; classification, meaning there is a lower bar for the gov&amp;#39;t to clear in order to justify discrimination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"CMV: I think that private schooling and homeschooling should be made illegal, and everyone be forced to attend public school.","I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually rich white kids that already have a socioenconomic advantage. I was a regular upper-middle class guy who went to public school. I loved it. My school was great. We went on fun field trips, and even a trip to Europe. Homeschooling your kid is just insurance that he/she will be socially awkward, and disadvantaged. Lots of homeschooling involves religious indoctrination, and very one-sided opinions. In public school you are exposed to many different views, opinions, and types of people. These problems would be solved if everyone had to go to public school.

CMV: Saggy pants are unacceptable but tolerated because of white guilt,"There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man showing nothing but boxers with little girls walking nearby?), but it is not and will not be addressed because of the fear of being called racist.   My view: Saggy pants is not a cultural quirk, nor akin wearing your hat backward. it is offensive in a very real way, and should not be tolerated (in the sense that indecency laws were created for the same underlying reason)  Edit: so through a few comments in this thread, I've altered my view on this...   1. it has been correctly noted that many ethnic groups sag their pants  2. Offensive really is subjective, and I've realized the solution is a society I really don't want to live in (shira law for example)  3. there really are examples of dress that could be more offensive from that perspective","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Umm..

"CMV: I think having a preference against promiscuous people is as valid as having a height or weight preference nor does it constitute ""slut-shaming"".","I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a ""slut"" the poster gets railed for it. I also don't think it is strictly the language being used. Regardless of the label, not wanting your partner to have been with 5+ people is 100% defensible. If we, as a society, can tell people that being tall is attractive or that being fat is unattractive, we can tell being that sleeping around is unattractive.       Another logically invalid argument is that the person with the preference, must not be promiscuous themselves. I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he's hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner's choice in me, we can like different things. Many physically fit men are ""chubby-chasers"" and man slutty men are virginal chasers.    Edit: To clarify, the use of the words ""slut"" earlier was merely a reflection of the term as it has been used on Reddit. I do not view a persons' worth as tied to their sexual history. I also don't have an moral qualms towards premarital sex or number of sexual partners. That said, my personal level of attraction is affected. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV:The USA is the least trustworthy nation to possess atomic weapons,"I have come to this conclusion for several reasons. *The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy.

CMV: The United States lost World War II,"I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters.  I am not disputing the fact that the United States achieved its principal military/political goals (defeat of the Third Reich and the Japanese Empire), and I of course recognize the fact that the US managed to do so with virtually no civilian casualties/ destruction of the homeland, which is especially impressive given the sheer scale of civilian destruction seen in World War II.  What I am arguing is that, having 'won' (as much as it is possible to win) the war, the United States promptly lost its soul, and has ended up in a worse position than Germany or Japan. The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.  I think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on. It's a cycle that only leads to cartoonishly large military budgets and American blood spilled in conflicts where we don't belong. In short, hegemony has not been kind to the United States, and we would be better off if we weren't a world power.  Contrast this with the Japanese and Germans, who are (arguably) doing rather well for themselves. Sure, each country was broken and defeated at the end of the war, and it took a very long time for them to recover, but they came out better. I say they came out better because neither the Japanese nor Germany have the 'obligation' to police the world. In fact, both countries forbid themselves from taking offensive military action. While these countries can be (and often are) considered 'western', and are sometimes the target of anti-western hate, they are not widely hated like the United States, and are not tasked with maintaining ridiculous global military presence. Rather (and forgive me for oversimplifying), Germany can focus on Germany and Japan can focus on Japan. One need not look long to find a wealth of statistics to indicate that these two nations have far superior social safety nets, education, healthcare, etc. than the United States. While this superiority can, of course, be attributed to a wide variety of factors, I believe that one cannot ignore the important fact that these nations have their priorities straight, having suffered the shame of defeat, having gone through the experience of rebuilding and being free of any expectation of global military prowess.  What really solidifies this belief for me is the existence of universal health care in most of western Europe. I apologize that I don't have the source, but if I remember correctly, I remember watching an interview with a worker in the UK's NHS, who attributed the success of socialized medicine in Europe (versus the US) to the fact that Europe had to rebuild after World War II. Effectively, when you have to start from scratch and pick your life up from the rubble, there's a greater sense of common bond with the rest of your nation. The US, having not been hurt in the war in the same way, never had to rebuild and instead developed a more violently individualistic character, where the idea of potentially paying for someone else's health care is utterly repulsive. Americans, by virtue of having won World War II without civilian casualty, has ended up with a far worse society than those who 'lost'. If that's the case, aren't we the real losers?

CMV: Nonwhite people should be grateful for the accomplishments that whites have made. African Americans should be thankful that they do not still live in Africa and nonwhite countries should view colonialism in a positive light.,"In spite of the imperfections of the USA and Europe, it still remains a truth that pretty much all of the most desirable places in the world are run by Caucasian Westerners. The quality of life for all people, even nonwhites, is generally correlated with the percent of white Westerners in leadership; Black Canadians have better lives than black Americans who have better lives than Jamaicans who have better lives than Congolese. This is true on a global scale; lily-white cities and countries generally report the best quality of life and highest GDP per capita. [The most developed countries in the world are almost all white-run or dependent on white-run countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index); even Japan is dependent on white Westerners for trade, military, disaster relief, and [entertainment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hāfu), and in spite of attempting to [Charles Atlas](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower) its way to development with superhuman feats of education and work ethic, Japan's GDP per capita still lags that of France. South Korea is the same way, with an even more endemic academic cheating culture. The problem is that nonwhites look at the few atrocities that whites have committed as representative of the entire white race, when even [Chris Rock](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/418164-if-you-re-black-you-got-to-look-at-america-a) acknowledges that white rule has had its share of pluses for the African American community. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV: I think it's OK for politicians to change their public stance on issues.,"Same-Sex marriage in the US is one of the ""hottest"" news stories of June, and many people are upset that some politicians (especially democratic ones) have gone from being against same-sex marriage to being for it, with statements often pointing to the (likely true) idea that their stance is based on public opinion.   However, I don't think we should be denouncing these politicians for changing their views on issues such as this one. We should actually *encourage* politicians to do so, *especially* when they change their views based on public opinion. Is this not a representative democracy? Isn't the whole point of a representative democracy for our representatives to actually *represent* the public's views on issues?   This isn't a CMV about whether politicians *really* change their views based on our opinion (I've seen the data; often times they act against the majority opinion due to lobbying efforts).  I just think that it's OK *if* politicians change their view based on public opinion.

"CMV: It doesn't make sense that saying ""bless you"" when someone sneezes is polite.","This is something that's always bothered me, all the way back to when I was a kid. I never understood why it was considered polite to say ""bless you"" after someone had sneezed.   From my understanding, because people believed sneezing was a demon being expelled from your body, they would say ""bless you."" Nowadays, that doesn't really make sense, and I doubt that anybody believes that is the reason people sneeze.   Now I don't really care if people prefer to say ""bless you"" after they hear someone sneeze, but it's absolutely ridiculous that some people actually get upset, and will even go as far as calling someone out for not saying ""bless you"" after they'd sneezed. They simply had a tickle in their nose and their body was getting whatever particles it didn't want in the nose out.   Some may say that it's similar to saying ""excuse me"" when they burp, fart, or yawn, but I disagree. Saying excuse me is a way of apologizing for being a disruption, while saying ""bless you"" is a silly way of saying ""I acknowledge that you have sneezed.""   Saying ""bless you"" doesn't make sense, and while it doesn't hurt to say, I shouldn't be ridiculed for refusing to congratulate someone on their sneeze. It becomes more disruptive than the sneeze itself and it's just silly.   Please, please CMV. I'm tired of getting shit for not wanting to say ""bless you"" but I'm also too stubborn of an asshole to conform.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you use the word &amp;quot;Goodbye&amp;quot;? Even though it has its etymology from a contraction of the phrase &amp;quot;God be with ye&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a perfectly rational reason as to why we say &amp;quot;Bless you&amp;quot; after a sneeze, you won&amp;#39;t find one. As you have already hear from other people in this thread, it is a cultural carry over from earlier times, and we do it out of convention. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Similarly, the secular usage of Merry Christmas or Goodbye can be applied to &amp;quot;Bless you&amp;quot;. You don&amp;#39;t have to literally mean that you wish to bless someone in a divine sense, you can apply it as a cultural custom.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other languages have different words for a post-sneeze polite convention, but none of them are objectively useful.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gesundheit (German) and Salud (Spanish) both just mean &amp;quot;health&amp;quot;, so they are a bit more direct to the point. But even then, they don&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;salud&amp;quot; when someone coughs, only when they sneeze.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is an illogical social custom, like many that we have, and you should just conform to it where it benefits you. If you think that you are in a situation with people that will get annoyed for you not saying it, just do. It&amp;#39;s silly, but not as silly as getting into an argument with your mother for no reason, or potentially offending a polite host at a dinner party or something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just a modern colloquialism. You don&amp;#39;t need to believe in god to say Merry Christmas. You don&amp;#39;t need to view this as congratulating a sneeze, it&amp;#39;s clearly evolved to become a modern, polite colloquialism. It doesn&amp;#39;t mean you are saying anything about demons or congratulating a sneeze or what have you. If I said, &amp;quot;Thursday was awesome&amp;quot; and you agreed, are we paying tribute to Thor? The word &amp;#39;awesome&amp;#39; also has historical use as a religious word to describe something great about god.

"CMV:Racism, sexism and general discrimination will only begin to fade when we stop pointing fingers and accept that ""Us"" vs ""Them"" isn't real, there is only ""Us"" on this earth.","It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. However, to make a group, each member has to have something in common, other than just being human. It could be gender, race, a common vision or belief. You get the idea.  So by uniting based on common characteristics, we automatically exclude those who don't fit the mould. Thus creating every kind of discrimination you can think of.  The worst part is, if you look at groups of people looking to reduce discrimination, they're as much as part of the problem as the original perpetrators. One example of this in action is the reporter who was kicked out of a Black Lives event in CSU. African Americans have a long history of mistreatment in the US and many have the right to be furious. But the problem is that they see all ""whites"" as being the perpetrators of this mistreatment and exacerbate the ""white vs black"" dichotomy.   My opinion on how to solve these issues is this: I've been told that to solve problems as a couple, you mustn't make it ""you"" vs ""partner"", you have to make it ""both of you as a couple"" vs ""the problem"". So I think we should apply the same logic to racism and sexism. Women vs men and whites vs blacks (only two of the uncountable amount of dichotomies that exist) can't be solved by separating and pointing fingers at the other group, it can only be solved by uniting. There is no Us vs Them, only Us.  Perhaps you've suffered discrimination first hand (as I have) and disagree with my opinion because you want justice above all. In which case, please explain your opinion.  Edit: Sorry if I reply late, having a bit of a family emergency. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;#39;re overlooking the fact that most of the progress that we&amp;#39;ve made so far (racism, sexism, etc.) has been because members of both groups have united against the problem. For example, when women finally achieved the right to vote it wasn&amp;#39;t simply because all women wanted to vote, while all men didn&amp;#39;t want this; members of both groups united and tackled the problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#39;s always blowback because not everyone wants to join, not everyone is as progressive as you think they are. Your view is (slightly) naive because it doesn&amp;#39;t take into account that there are those people who accept (an out of balance) status quo and are willing to defend it. A simple example on Reddit is TRP. Feminists welcome men and women to work for the equality of women, but this doesn&amp;#39;t go down too well with everyone so there are counter-movements. TRP is an example of a lot of stupid people who aren&amp;#39;t comfortable with change because they don&amp;#39;t understand it or because they feel that it&amp;#39;s going too far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Women vs men and whites vs blacks (only two of the uncountable amount of dichotomies that exist) can&amp;#39;t be solved by separating and pointing fingers at the other group, it can only be solved by uniting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This sounds great on the surface, but fails horribly in practice. Most racism and sexism happens subconsciously. A white man is going to want to hire other white men. It&amp;#39;s not that he&amp;#39;s racist; it&amp;#39;s just that we like people that are like us. Unless you point out this behavior and make him conscious of it, it will continue on forever.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Likewise, a police department may arrest black people at a higher proportion than white people. It&amp;#39;s not that they are racist, but the arrest records show that black people are more likely to be criminals; a connection is made in your mind. Making it a visible topic, you get the chance to consider whether black people really &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; more likely to be criminals, or if it is a self-perpetuating bias.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"CMV: Transsexuals suffer from a form of body dysmorphia, or a similar affliction, and should be treated with counseling rather than be allowed to go through with gender reassignment surgery.","I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning.

We are also developing an idea of how people who are anorexic or bulimic almost certainly view their bodies in such a way that is not representative of reality and often harm themselves in attempts to lose weight.

Certainly, an individual with alien hand syndrome could have a procedure to remove their hand in a safe and controlled environment and continue living a suitable life. We don't allow that, though.

Generally speaking, gender identity entails self-appraisal according to the traits most often associated with one sex or the other (called gender traits), and these can be influenced to some degree by cultural norms. Sexual orientation also entails self-appraisal in the context of culture. For purposes of understanding the neurobiology of sex, it is helpful to think of genotypic sex as largely immutable, phenotypic sex as modifiable (by developmental processes, hormone treatment, and/or surgery), and gender as a more complex construct that is determined culturally as well as biologically.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We, as a society, have decided that these are sick individuals who need medical and psychiatric attention.

No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Compare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, &lt;a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/""&gt;responds well&lt;/a&gt; to both &lt;a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/""&gt;therapy and SSRIs.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Three, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. &lt;a href=""http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf""&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). &lt;a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract""&gt;Another&lt;/a&gt; found that on a test designed to measure distress, &amp;quot;significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract""&gt;Another&lt;/a&gt; found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. &lt;a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168""&gt;Yet another&lt;/a&gt; found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition.

"CMV: Coffee is overrated, the effects received are negligible and often a placebo, and people who say they like the taste are lying to themselves.","I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do.  Every child growing up seems to desire coffee, but only because it's age restricted, similar to alcohol/tobacco. Now I don't have a PhD in psychology or anything, but there is evidence beyond proof that people want what they can't have. It's just human nature, and I feel like it's what's behind the longterm desire for coffee in that something I was once barred from is now freely enjoyed and encouraged. It doesn't help that many people jack their cups with sugars and creams which at a certain point require speculation as to which substance is actually fueling your perceived energy boost.  I consider myself to be very openminded, especially when it comes to substances put into the body for recreational purposes (I'll leave it at that) but I can't seem to see eye-to-eye to my friends that have been religiously trying to convert me all these years.  The extent of my coffee experience would be instant coffee growing up at home (parents weren't 'connoisseurs' by any iteration of the term but were both pretty addicted to), pretentious (shots fired) coffee shops that my fiends would literally drag me to, and the occasional tinder date Starbucks run in which I would just end up getting the vanilla bean frappe 90% of the time, which is delicious by the way.  It seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.  Could that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee?

And corruption has happened in the past, and it will most certainly happen again in the future.

So, if your opinion differs from the popular one, the FBI will be watching you: &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO""&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The above link includes law-abiding and non-hate groups: vietnam protesters, Native Americans, civil rights movements, and socialists. Is it so distant to say a program like this could be used to target people that oppose the president&amp;#39;s agenda, like rival politicians? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying, I understand where you&amp;#39;re coming from, and yes you bring some valid points. Why would any law-abiding citizen need to worry about government monitoring of the internet? I&amp;#39;ve heard some people compare it to the police, and that it is in our best interest.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;but there some major problems:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For me personally, it worries me that by allowing the government to observe anyone&amp;#39;s personal lives, at any time puts a lot of power into government hands, and opens even more doors for corruption and abuse of power. As it stands, there is no one in to hold the government accountable. We have no clue how broad the spying is or how much of it happens. Who is there to say, &amp;quot;hey, that&amp;#39;s not right&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;hey you&amp;#39;re not really working for the better of the people&amp;quot;? No one really. That&amp;#39;s a scary thought to me. When the American people trade liberty for security, they have to put more and more faith in a government that has time after time proved itself to be unreliable. Politics are just like anything else in this world: there are good ones and bad ones. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The other main issue is that it&amp;#39;s not really working out too well. The FBI has admitted that they have not foiled any terrorist threats from spying on US citizens.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The main point I&amp;#39;m trying to get at is that if we don&amp;#39;t oppose this, then we are giving the US government a HUGE amount of power and pretty much giving it no limits to that power. Which is against everything America stands for (Limits and balances to power).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: There is something inherently wrong with individuals who like pineapple on their pizza.,"I have always hated pineapple pizza. I have tried it regularly for years to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding the appeal but it has never worked. Pineapple is a relatively sweet fruit on it's own and a combination of sweet and salty flavors is not that uncommon, however no amount of pepperoni or any other topping can mask the vile taste and dissappointment that is a mouthful of delicious pizza ruined by the fruit. This has led me to the conclusion that there is either something psychologically or potentially physiologically wrong with people who like pineapple pizza. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV: Sword Art Online is one of the best Anime of All Time [SPOILERS],"I've recently subscribed to r/anime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is massively misrepresented as mediocre among fellow fans and otakus. Currently ranked [#459 on MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online), this show scores an average rating of only 8 out of 10 nerd points.  I believe this is due primarily to *hater votes*. It should be in the top 50, if not top 25, anime of all time.  In fairness to the haters, the ALO arcs sort of ruined it with the whole sister romance harem thing. Japanese people are weird, but they sure know how to milk a hit show. For that reason, SAO II is not considered here; just vanilla SAO please!  Some Background  ---  I am a 30-year old male product writer for the web, and I am not what most would consider an otaku or weeabo. (I prefer Korean culture, if we're comparing asking, and I don't go to cons, collect or read much Manga, or follow every anime series.) I watch anime recreationally, and consider myself a reasonable self-styled critic. I've recently watched quite a number of shows, being bored at home, and I've watched and rewatched SAO several times and am familiar with it.   ---  **Why The Show Is Good**  Characters: The cast is great. Voice acting isn't overdone or underdone, and the characters all feel like people from a real world stuck in a game for a long time together. It also makes sense that they're all there.  Plot: The premise is not made of solid gold, but it's interesting enough to lend itself to greatness. If you die in the game, you die for real no quitsies. This has been done before in fiction, of course. However, SAO takes a different treatment of this premise. Normally, you would see horror, like in a show like Gantz, applied, or game aspects, such as in No Game No Life.   SAO's goal is rather to show that a virtual world can be real and fulfilling. Its creators accomplish this by focusing not on the MMO aspects, which are limited to flavor, but rather on the interaction between strong characters and the tension of being trapped within this scary world. The story itself lends itself to a rich world, and the writers take advantage of the larger arc to fit in almost a dozen sub-arcs in 24 episodes. The show is *very* story dense for an anime; normally, a single sub-arc would take 4-6 episodes. These sub-arcs balance developing the world, fighting, and building relationships. The characters build on their strengths and flaws and often find themselves in situations partially crafted of their own making. (Example; Asuna is hard on her guild and pushy, and this results in a poor culture within the guild that causes problems as the series develops.) There are no unbelievable moments.  In the end, the heroes triumph, but it's not a boring triumph. They often sacrifice during the show and make many mistakes that weigh upon them. At the ending bar scene, you can feel the air of both relief and regret washing over all of the former players.  At the symbolic level, SAO is very symbolic of life itself. God puts us on this plant, and we don't get to leave unless we die. So we adapt to it and live in it, the same as in SAO's virtual world. This allegoric story pairs well with the show's many slice-of-life scenes, creating a very vibrant and real-seeming virtual world.  **Writing:** SAO does not waste time or words. No episode is filler, and each main character is multi-dimensional and arrives naturally in the main story arc. Characters do not break character. Villains are villains. Episodes are succinct and *excellently paced.* This show is so clean that you can eat off of it.  **Art:** The art direction is superb. Each character's outfit is suitable for their personality and status. Motion and combat is more fluid and direct as well as it was in Fate: UBW and other highly regarded similar shows. It was smoother than classic epics like Record of Lodoss War and Gurren Lagann or modern releases like Arslan. Admittedly, it probably had a bigger budget than those shows, but that shouldn't be a detracting factor at all. The only *fantasy world* anime I would give a higher regard to in art direction is Berserk, but in quality of animation, SAO crushes Berserk.  The only complaint you could make in the art department is that the show wasn't stylized enough to differentiate it from other fantasy anime.  For instance, the art direction in Kill la Kill was an incredible thematic rush of color with awesome hand-painted backgrounds. I'll grant that point, but can you name a fantasy anime with a better quality of animation offhand?  **Avoids Most Awful Anime Pitfalls:** Fanservice, chibi conversations, people falling off of park benches or turning into paper; these are the marks of an anime breaking the fourth wall and ruining suspension of disbelief for the view. In short, they're signs that an anime doesn't take itself seriously. Almost no anime of any level of notoriety, excluding comedies, uses these generic tactics.  ---  **Arguments Against**  &gt; Overpowered Main Character  The story follows Kirito, a regular guy with some Kendo training and beta test experience in an online game. Kirito earns almost all of his levels solo and is on par with the very best fighters in the game. He starts off with an advantage due to his experience, gets full exp. for the very first boss, and grinds pretty much every day from there on out to stay on top of the curve. He clearly earns his main character slot through a number of trials instead of being handed it by the divine will of the writers, such as in every other anime ever. He is given a unique skill, eventually, which is powerful, but it's relatively balanced because it's difficult to use. His backstory and skillset are reasonable, and given that there must be a ""best"" among all the players, it makes sense that the show would follow him.  Meanwhile, in How to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, the main character is literally given a skill that says ""become overpowered against things you can't beat."" It's shit like that which makes me want to throw my laptop.  &gt; Dumb Plot Moments  In the first or second episode, another beta tester dies in Kirito's arms not because he was defeated, but because he turned down a potion. That guy was obviously a fuckin' idiot, and that scene could have been saved if he had just drank up and laid there. This is a fair criticism. Additionally, the army guild unit that marches in to fight the minotaur boss half dead is also made of retards. However, it's noted in the show that the reason they do this is because the army has been terrorizing its members. However, those deaths serve a purpose within the show and are not overtly distracting. The dumb beta guy's death serves to inspire Kirito to action and turns him into the MC. The dumb army guys are, much like the group that runs into the trap room early in the series, there to set Kirito on the right path and force him into action.  In the meantime, how will you excuse characters like Faye Valentine in one of your favorite anime, Cowboy Bebop? She's just there to be a plot instigator with a pair of giant boobs. Almost. Entirely. Fanservice. Many other very good anime have done much much worse with their cast and still rank top 50. Hell, Hajime no Ippo is fan ranked 20 on MAL, and although I won't disagree that the show is awesome, it's just following the formula of a hundred other sports anime shows like Prince of Tennis. OWARI NO SERAPH is even up there, and that show literally only has one redeeming character -- who isn't in most episodes. Hell, characters are invented out of thin air and people do dumb shit in Game of Thrones every other episode. Are you really going to say that SAO's weak point is a few serviceable plot blunders and side characters that didn't think through some obvious mistakes?  &gt; You didn't like the ending  The ending probably irked a few of people because it was so sudden. However, that's really the magic of the series. It's a virtual world controlled by a nutty, manipulative scientist-god whose purposes are unknown. That's the driving mystery behind every episode. Why are they even there? Why is the NPC planted in the guild as the final boss? Why is the psychologist AI disabled?  Without that underlying tension, the series doesn't take shape. The story is about human actors making intense decisions, and the elusive creator adds another layer to the conflict. It makes the story feel bigger than it is and every victory seem hollow. This in turn allows our main characters to keep driving forward.  Plus, they've already put in so many boss fights. I thought the defeat of the technically invincible guild leader was an awesome way to end, although it's obviously hedging a sequel.  I'm tired of typing, so I won't bore you with more examples. Although I really wish they had done much more with the sequels, I believe the original series ranks among the best-produced, best scripted, cleanest, most heartfelt Anime of all time. I look forward to your spirited replies.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

The first arc is pretty great but I feel a lot of potential was missed out on and I would put a lot of more expanded and complete . I know it is based on the light novel series but feel that the anime could use a western comic book style reboot/reimagining. The original light novel was written as a stand alone work and the author did not anticipate how successful it would be.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reset would create an expanded anime in the setting of Sword Art online with an expanded focus (as in some episodes featuring Asuna and others without Kirito) that fills in the details of the over two year timespan of the over two year life of the game. So many things weren&amp;#39;t explored enough like Kirito&amp;#39;s beater status and people&amp;#39;s negative perceptions of him, how Asuna&amp;#39;s character developed to be so strong, the solidification of the Knights of the Blood Oath along with development and foreshadowing of Heathcliff&amp;#39;s very important character, and making the game feel like more of a world overall. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I feel if they did that and made it end when the game ended would allow it to contend as one of the greatest anime&amp;#39;s all time. The anime right now suffered from not developing enough plot lines and from the way it is dragging on. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an anime to be &lt;em&gt;one of the best of all time,&lt;/em&gt; it needs to stand out in an extraordinary way. What you&amp;#39;ve said is basically &amp;quot;the voice acting is good but not extraordinary, the plot is good but not that good, the art is really good but still bested by other anime, it avoids most major pitfalls...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What makes this anime &lt;em&gt;fantastic?&lt;/em&gt; what makes it stand out above everything else? What makes it &lt;em&gt;unique?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;hr/&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A side note: I would warn you against using an anime&amp;#39;s Netflix ratings to determine how great it is. Critic ratings and similar are probably much better.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When a Netflix watcher rates a series low, it&amp;#39;s because they personally didn&amp;#39;t like it. Remember that Netflix gives you suggestions based on your ratings of previous movies. It actually has a message that says &amp;quot;did you like this? If so, give it lots of stars and we&amp;#39;ll suggest more similar!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I watched about 3 episodes perhaps a year ago. I hated it. I was expecting a shonen story with lots of interesting fights and battles. Instead, I got so much chat, development of relationships, and tearful good-byes, and so little &lt;em&gt;fighting,&lt;/em&gt; that I thought I had stumbled into a gay romance anime.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not that there&amp;#39;s anything wrong with gay romance anime. But I don&amp;#39;t like them, I don&amp;#39;t want Netflix suggesting them to me, and so I gave it a low rating and moved on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV:Those positively identified and convicted of armed robbery/home invasion should be put to death.,"Hey CMV, I'll keep this one simple. I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or other easily lethal weapon, they have no place in society and have a fundamental defect in their human brain chemistry (without even touching on the trauma and psychological damage the victims must suffer). To me, this type of crime shows an extreme amount of depravity. You're brandishing a weapon, ready to kill a person you do not even know, for short term profit. This especially applies to home invasions and store robberies. The reason I added the 'positively identified' caveat is that I don't want to leave any room for putting an innocent person to death, so for this case to kick in, I would need either CCTV confirming their identity, or multiple eye witnesses confirming their identity.  I'm willing to admit this view may be on the extreme side, but I like to think I'm a reasonable person and I'm open to change. So reddit, please CMV.  **EDIT: I should have clarified, please assume LOADED weapons or a knife, and the offender is NOT a juvenile. To me, these are different cases and do not deserve the death penalty.**  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The death penalty for armed robberies would be insanely, unrealistically expensive.  Death penalty cases cost way more than even life in prison, because we want to be really really sure we&amp;#39;re right before we execute someone.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year, according to the FBI, there were about 345,454 armed robberies in the US.  The actual costs of a death penalty case vary, but somewhere around $1,000,000 seems like a pretty common estimate.  So, in a year, we&amp;#39;re looking at about $345,454,000,000.  Is that really worth it?  Are the benefits (reduced crime rate, comfort to the victims...) really worth the 300 BILLION dollar price tag?  Who&amp;#39;s paying for that?  Is that really the best use of the money?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Morality aside (and for the record, I&amp;#39;m very morally against it), death penalty for armed robbery would just be too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/violent-crime/violent-crime-topic-page/violentcrimemain_final""&gt;https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/violent-crime/violent-crime-topic-page/violentcrimemain_final&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty""&gt;http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s not a correlation between crime rates dropping in areas where the severity of punishment is harsher. For example, in Texas, the death penalty is present, but it doesn&amp;#39;t stop people from murdering other people. Another example: in the top 20 states with murders per 100,000 people, or rather, in the top 20 worst states for murder rates, only 5 do not have the death penalty. In the top 20 states with the LOWEST murder rates, 12/20 do NOT have the death penalty. It can be argued that punishment is not a detractor of criminal behavior. &lt;a href=""http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/murder-rates-nationally-and-state#MRord""&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a personal anecdote, my apartment was broken into when I was just a year out of college. My girlfriend at the time came home to find the house had been broken into and apparently the people had just left. She went upstairs and found a knife from our kitchen, upstairs in our bedroom. So the robber had broken in, taken the knife from our kitchen and brought it upstairs with him in case he met anyone up there, I guess. But who is to say his intent? Was it scary as shit? YES. Did it make me feel very unsafe in my home? YES. But I also know that some robbers carry weapons solely for personal protection and not to actively harm people. Some robbers take them and use them to scare or intimidate people. Who is to say that it was ever their intention to use it on someone? Seems a pretty stiff penalty to give someone the death penalty when you could never truly know their intentions or if they would have gone through with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edits made for spelling, punctuation and just generally awful flow of the paragraphs.

CMV: City life is hugely preferable to country/small town life,"I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small town/village, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too many to list, but the big ones are:  #Cities have significantly better municipal services.  The difference is night and day. Cities have bigger and better libraries, schools, police/fire departments, hospitals, gas, internet, and so on and so forth. As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first. Everything about this makes city life so much safer and more comfortable.  #Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.  A really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops. Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties. There are theatres and large public events and strip clubs and meetings of like-minded people and clubs and just about anything to do if you ever get bored. There's a convenience store on just about every corner.  #Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity.  If you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a **new neighbor** that they wanna get to know and everything. Even if you abstain from social interaction, you become ""that weird neighbor that abstains from social interaction."" This  tends to temper individualism, and it's not like you can ""just spend time with the people you like,"" because rumors and all travel fast with a community that small.  #bugs  holy fucking shit the bugs aaaaaaaaa  #In the country, everything is high maintenance.  Since just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;there is a greater range of things to do&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would greatly dispute this.  Few cities have any decent opportunities for hiking, kayaking, sailing, hunting, trapping, fishing, birding, shooting, or a great deal of other activities.  When I find myself in a city for whatever reasons, I find myself quickly getting bored due to the lack of interesting things to do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are theatres&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Small towns have those too.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;large public events&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a negative to me.  I can only think of one large public event that I enjoy, and it involves camping.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;strip clubs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t need or want them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;meetings of like-minded people and clubs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are pretty easy to find out in the country.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;just about anything to do if you ever get bored&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like I stated before, cities have a severe lack of most of the sorts of things I like doing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This can also effectively be achieved by having a mile or so in between your house and your neighbour&amp;#39;s.  You never have to see another human if you don&amp;#39;t want to.  Cities are just so crowded and there are people everywhere.  In a city, I feel like I can&amp;#39;t snese without accidentally invading someone&amp;#39;s space, and I certainly have no hope of having no one invade mine.  In the right place country, I could set off a bomb and no one would give a shit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;bugs&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;holy fucking shit the bugs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is actually a major plus to me.  In the city, I&amp;#39;m lucky to see a single Black Saddlebags, but in the country I can see a wide range of different insects.  As someone with a fascination for entomology, this is a fantastic experience to me.  The only bugs I don&amp;#39;t like are things like gnats and mosquitoes, but you get those in cities just as much as you do in the country.  Maybe even more so, depending on the place.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the country, everything is high maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since just about everything that isn&amp;#39;t a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sounds like you are making stuff up.  I have not experienced any appliances having significantly shorter lives in the country.  It is pretty easy to keep things clean even living far from other people.  Living in the country is not the same as camping.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Overall, I can&amp;#39;t imagine ever being able to live in a city.  Most cities I measure how long I can stand to be in them in hours (the best cities rate days).  A few cities I would only be able to stand a few minutes and at least one I found so terrible that I refuse to ever go there again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit:  I forgot to point out the most important one: &amp;quot;Everything is closer in the city&amp;quot;.  I love having space and having things further apart means more space.  Having things closer together is a big negative to me and is the main reason that I would not be able to ever stand living in the city.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Honestly, this just shows a lack of maturity and a fundamental lack of knowledge about the human condition. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cities have bigger and better libraries&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OK... but I don&amp;#39;t need a big library. I just need a kiosk that is part of the intra-library loan program. When I want to read a book, I do it from home.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;schools&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is rather obviously not the case. Public schools in major cities are cesspools, and achieve worse results with more funding than suburban or rural schools. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;police/fire departments&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know of any way to measure this, other than to say that my sheriff&amp;#39;s office has cleared 100% of the homicides in my county in the last 10 years... how&amp;#39;s your city doing in that regard?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;hospitals&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sure&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;gas&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got some bad news for you, there, bucko. Gas, both of the gasoline and natural varieties, is cheaper in the country. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;internet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at the edge of a small city, so I get to partake of their municipal broadband. I pay $34.99 a month for 50/5. No caps or bullshit or trying to sell my information to the highest bidder either. When I have an issue, I call a local phone number than is answered by a local tech. The one time I&amp;#39;ve had to have a tech come out to my house, I called at noon and he was there by 1:30. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I mean this in the nicest possible way, but I&amp;#39;m kicking your ass in this regard. Might want to try again. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who&amp;#39;s going to get it first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had 4G LTE since 2012. And it&amp;#39;s fast. Much faster than yours, as a matter of fact, since I have significantly less traffic congestion. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;OK... and?

A mall is one of the last things I&amp;#39;d consider a positive. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the best restaurants I&amp;#39;ve ever been to was the Old Miner&amp;#39;s Inn in Alba, MO, population 555. Michelin 3 star French cuisine. Phenomenal. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another personal favorite is the Craftwood Inn in Manitou Springs, Colorado, population 5,245.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are theatres&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are theatres everywhere. Even in small towns. Those movin&amp;#39; pictures sure are cool!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;large public events&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We have those too, but I have to tell you, I hate crowds, and have less than zero interest in going to a large public event. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;strip clubs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re seriously listing this as a positive? &lt;em&gt;Come to Metropolis, we have more strip clubs per capita than any other city in the US!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;meetings of like-minded people&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got some more news for you. You have meetings of like-minded people everywhere. All that&amp;#39;s required for said meeting is for several like-minded people to locate one another. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;clubs &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Please see my previous comment about crowds&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;just about anything to do if you ever get bored&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lived in the country for more than 15 years now, and I can&amp;#39;t say that I&amp;#39;ve ever been bored. I&amp;#39;d guess that one big difference between myself and a denzien of, say, NYC, is that the activities I choose to entertain myself mainly occur outside.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a convenience store on just about every corner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It saddens me that you view this as a good thing. I personally find this worse than the previous comment about strip clubs. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, the co-op board sure does. And the nosy neighbors that I am now forced to share a wall with do. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you move into the country you&amp;#39;ve got a ton of people who have a new neighbor that they wanna get to know and everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Heaven forbid that people want to be friendly, as opposed to smacking the ceiling with a broom handle and telling you to turn down your music. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if you abstain from social interaction, you become &amp;quot;that weird neighbor that abstains from social interaction.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As opposed to the weirdo in 4C that has his groceries delivered and hasn&amp;#39;t left his apartment in 2 years? And have you walked by there lately?

Or have a bonfire to celebrate something. Smoke meat without getting the fire department called on me. Shoot in my backyard without getting the police called on me. Walk down the road without being worried about getting mugged. Leave my keys in the car without worrying about it being stolen. And have enough disposable income, due to my dramatically lower cost of living, that if the wife and I want to take in a Broadway show, we can fly up, do it, and then fly home. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: Studio Ghibli is overrated and their films more often than not require an adaptation in the western film adjusted viewer's watching habits in order to be perceived as enjoyable,"I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in top movie list rankings. I am a westerner who has had exposure mainly to western film but also enjoys many other film types and cultures including Japanese and anime film.  However, I don't much care for Studio Ghibli stuff. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I don't like it. Except for Hisaishi's music, which I think is beautiful. I don't know why everyone seems to like these films so much.   It bothers me as lots of my other views in life are congruent with the norm, or I can see why they vary.  I've watched lots of Ghibli films in order to give them a chance. I've already heard lots of people arguing that the artwork is great (and I do agree it is) and that's what makes the film great, but that doesn't cut it for me; the same people who argue in this way don't seem to apply that logic to the other films they watch and so must be adapting their viewing style for Ghibli or just repeating something they heard somewhere else, not responding as they normally would (perhaps with reference to direction, plot, acting, action, scripting, etc) when asked why they like a film.  Any comments or thoughts (outside of 'the artwork is so good') would be appreciated.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARNING Princess Mononoke Spoilers ahead!!!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Which films have you watched? I would say my two favorites are Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. With all of their films you have to first accept the fantastical world in which they live. There are ghosts, creatures, and spells. I&amp;#39;ll try and give you a run down for what I love about Mononoke aside from the music and artwork (which I agree, are fantastic). I was going to do both but this one ended up long enough.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Princess Mononoke is a real out and out fantasty/action movie. It has very strong environmental themes, anti-war themes, and a number of wonderfully grey characters. Aside from Ashitaka everyone is flawed, proud, and stuck thinking that their way is the only way. No character is all evil or all good. There are strong women and men and each side truly believes in its cause.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The entire opening sequence is excellent. Ashitaka, the prince of a hidden and ancient people, spies something huge and evil coming towards his town. Him and his badass elk Yakul chase the thing down and kill it before it can harm the village but at his own sacrifice. He must leave and try and find a cure to the evil the beast poisoned him with. That evil (stemming from a bullet) is at the base of this movie. All at once it causes great suffering, but it also gives Ashitaka power and strength.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There follows a long excellent journey where he meets various people. It all culminates in the boars&amp;#39; suicide attack and the attempted killing of the forest god, a creature that is perfectly loved and serene. I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve watched this movie, but every time this scene comes around it affects me. It comes down to a war between nature and industry and as the heroes of nature and torn down in their folly you can feel how it affects many of the characters involved. This got a bit rambly and I have to run, might look it back over later.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a quick note Spirited Away has a number of big themes as well as being a great film for children and adults (like the Pixar greats) and a stellar and compelling main character. Is it number 10 of all time like the list today on &lt;a href=""/r/movies""&gt;/r/movies&lt;/a&gt; put it? I don&amp;#39;t know. But I do think they&amp;#39;re both excellent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of CMV is pointless. Nobody is going to be able to convince you to be retroactively moved by a film.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, I can assure you that nobody is &amp;quot;faking&amp;quot; their love for these movies, as you suggest. Why the hell would people do that? It&amp;#39;s not even as though there&amp;#39;s some intellectual clout to be gained by claiming to like movies that are largely indistinguishable to non-fans from trashy mecha anime.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Miyazaki&amp;#39;s films have strong, rounded characters, beautiful imagery, fantastic music, and inventive, original plots (who the hell else has ever made a decent movie about a supernatural bathhouse?). That sounds like exactly what I look for in other films.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0

Imagine a schizophrenic telling you about his condition and you responding by, yeah, I know what you mean, I drink a lot.

"CMV: He, she, they. That's all the pronouns you are getting.","My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in the wild is ""xe/xer/xerself"" or ""zi/zis/zimself"". My argument is as follows:  1. Pronouns are always dealing with a spectrum. A ""he"" can be used to describe both masculine as well as feminine men and similarly for she and women. The singular they is also covering a spectrum, the spectrum of all people that do not identify with either gender or those that identify with both to differing degrees. Therefore they is sufficient to describe alternative gender identities. 2. If we'd decide that new pronouns are necessary to describe or be inclusive to specific non-standard gender identities, we would very likely end up with a sheer infinite amount of pronouns. Since the argument for further pronouns would not be based on scientific facts but rather on feelings of individual people, the argument why some new pronouns are okay and others aren't would be a very difficult one to make. The result would be that we would have to allow anyone to pick or create their own pronouns. 3. Since we'd have a large number of new pronouns people would very likely get confused, since they'd not only have to remember a name and a face but also the specific pronouns of a person AND incorporate those into everyday speech. The result would either be that people would start inadvertently giving offence or our speech patterns would change to rely far more on using names instead of pronouns.  4. Having a wide range of new pronouns would actively harm the English language by making it less clear. Encountering unknown pronouns would confuse people and make it difficult to imagine what kind of character is being talked about.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If someone is doing my car repair, why am I forced to include information about their genitals every time I talk about them? The words he/she are forcing me to both know and share data about a person&amp;#39;s gender when I have no interest in doing so. Similarly in some more generic context where I am talking about a theoretical individual who doesn&amp;#39;t actually exist yet and whose gender will be irrelevant, I am forced to use &amp;quot;he/she&amp;quot; to refer to them.

CMV: I believe that socialism is fundamentally better than capitalism,"For the purpose of this post, I am defining ""capitalism"" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. ""Socialism"" is defined as a system in which the government owns the means of production, and distributes all things necessary for decent quality of life (food, water, shelter, education, health care, etc) for free to all minors and any adult either working, seeking work, or enrolled in school. I understand that this definition is more specific than the true definition of socialism, but I want to preempt any arguments suggesting that people won't look for work if everything is provided for them anyway; they won't be provided for unless they contribute. Also, please note that I am not advocating any specific system of governance; I don't want a debate about the merits of direct democracy. Assume that the system of governance is something effective and relatively democratic, unless there is a compelling reason why my definition of socialism ensures ineffective government.  With that out of the way, here is my justification. I believe that capitalism ensures exploitation of the lower-classes. The winners in a capitalist system are nearly always those who were born into relative wealth already. Even the rags-to-riches stories of our time, such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, they were all born into at least lower-middle class. Those trapped in poverty are normal people, who usually work much harder than the people at the top, and get nothing for it. I don't mean to put down high-ranking executives, or other wealthy individuals, but I think that if capitalism is designed to benefit those who work hard, it's doing a shoddy job. Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair.  And that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.  Not only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a ""Green!"" or ""Eco-Friendly"" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot).   So, with those reasons put out for why capitalism is bad, here's why I think socialism is better. Socialism prevents needless death and suffering by ensuring that everyone who contributes gets everything they need for a healthy life. Socialism ends cyclical poverty by giving everyone a chance at education, without worries about putting food on the table. Socialism is better for rewarding the hard-workers and punishing the slackers, because without unfair head starts going to rich kids entering the workforce, the real cream will rise to the top (there would be variable wages and such; the government employers could offer raises and promotions to their best workers). Socialism is better for the environment, because the government could have direct control, and would have much more incentive to manage the environment in sustainable ways than short-term-minded corporations.  I guess I can go further in depth in my replies, if needed. I'm looking for a good debate, and maybe a change of heart. Change my view!  EDIT: OK all, so I have been persuaded by a combination of factors that socialism as I define it is not as good as capitalism with generous welfare policies and heavy regulations (think Nordic model). I'll be giving out deltas now. I will continue debating as well, but I think I'm done for now. I will resume later.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a &amp;quot;Green!&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Eco-Friendly&amp;quot; sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well that&amp;#39;s not a fair argument since the Soivet Union, North Korea, and other Socialist countries back in the 70s and 80s were known to use the worste envirmental standards in the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also the reason we need oil production still is the fact we need things, even solar power, hydro, wing, and electronic cars still use oil in the production of that item. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look at all the people in America, one of the world&amp;#39;s wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It&amp;#39;s just not fair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To those people I say what job are they working? My degree is going to allow me to make a decent living, while a lot of people who have taken weak degree are falling behind, because they think, because they have a degree they should be paid a good salary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s the real problem with capitalism; it isn&amp;#39;t fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think your facts are wrong here.  Global capitalism feeds billions and prevents waste, whereas socialism has created immense waste, suffering, and deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To take a specific example, let&amp;#39;s look at China.  China had a communist revolution in the 1940s, and has been governed by the Communist party since.  From the beginning of their rule, the party, under Mao, engaged in a program of collectivization and state control of the means of production.  This peaked in the late 1950s with the &amp;quot;Great Leap Forward.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was the largest mass killing in human history.  In three years, &lt;a href=""http://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/mao-and-great-leap-forward""&gt;between 20 and 43 million people died&lt;/a&gt;, largely as the result of starvation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since the death of Mao, beginning under Deng Xiaoping, China has adopted capitalist market reforms, including private ownership of capital, property rights, and open trade with other countries.  In that time, &lt;a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/04/18/heres-how-much-poverty-has-declined-in-china/""&gt;the percent of Chinese residents in extreme poverty has gone from about 84% to about 12%&lt;/a&gt;.  Socialism failed in China and resulted in mass death.  Capitalism has succeeded and pulled hundreds and hundreds of millions of people out of abject poverty.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;edit:&lt;/em&gt; I typoed Deng&amp;#39;s name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Anti-Victim-blaming culture is suppressing the spread of helpful information that can prevent rape.,"I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that information triggers victims, and therefore the information ends up at ends. This includes language such as ""Pepper spray can deter attackers of any kind, and therefore it is strongly recommended that ANYBODY carries it with them at all times."" or ""Hot zones for crime include times after dusk and before dawn, so it is advised to travel in groups at this time to deter attackers.""  People rage at this information saying that I should not ask anything of the victim, and that this information is useless. People often use the argument ""We should teach people NOT TO RAPE""  My issue here is that the suppression of this information in lieu of pursuing an idealistic rape-free culture neglects the current standing of our surroundings, and that dangerous people still exist, and will exist for the foreseeable future. I see no harm in telling anyone that safety is important, and that there are very cogent steps to significantly lower your risk of being attacked and/or raped.  The only instance I would excuse my previous statement would be people telling actual victims of rape what they COULD have done. This does nothing to change what happened, and is a slimey thing to do.  Maybe this is just an Anti-SJW rant that I didn't even know I was making, or maybe I have an actual argument here. If I am not clear on this classic argument, I would appreciate some clarity, and am always open to thoughtful and courteous discussion.  Please no flaming, arguing, or fighting.

He was constantly making loud ""woo-ing"" noises throughout the entire movie, being quite the disturbance. *Edit: He may have another disability as well, it was difficult to tell. Deafness was the only apparent one.* Much of the audience was clearly uncomfortable, but didn't want to ask his guardians or someone from the theater to get him to leave. I was having quite the moral dilemma about it, I didn't ask either, so I'm not saying that anyone was in the wrong about staying quiet.  Perhaps he shouldn't have been at the movie to begin with because of the graphic nature of the film, but that wouldn't have been enough to ask him to leave.   So, change my view.

CMV: The US constitution and its amendments need to be re-written or updated and should be every 100 years or so.,"The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to tease out meaning. Many other amendments overlap in meaning and could be combined to simplify them while also covering more people. The fact is, it is outdated.  I believe it should be revised every 100 years or so because culture and language are organic. They change based on technology, public conscious, and international relations. Should we follow the advice of a group who believed slavery was acceptable? That thought only white, male, property owners should/could vote? Can you read through the document and understand what was meant or does much of it come across as confusing to todays readers? The world has changed and I believe we need to change with it in order to be relevant. I also believe our ideas and views from today will experience the same degradation over time. In 100 years will the world still care about gun rights? Will the population still speak mostly english or will we add more spanish to our vocabulary? Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had? We cannot know. We should not force our ideas through time, expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers.  What I can't understand is why we are clinging to the past, to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today. We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs. We should update, revise, and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are. I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either. I am saying we should interpret it for today, update it, and use our revised version instead. Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed. It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws. It would take a lot of work, a lot would change, but I believe we would be better for it. CMV  ---Edit--- Many responses seem to think I am saying scrap the whole thing and start over. No, I am saying we need an updated, reworded one that uses the meanings as we take them today. All men are equal shoule read all persons, prohibition and its repeal should just be removed, the 15th and 19th should be combined and all inclusive with restrictions put in after the fact. Those are examples of what I mean but not the whole of it.  To CMV you need to show me that having an old, poorly worded document is better than a revision of it in modern terms. It would be hard to do but it would be better for the nation and easier to work with than if we left it be. CMV  (also, deltas incoming for added info on the topic.

CMV: Black and white are colors,"Artists, pedants, and pedantic artists like to say that black and white are not colors, because of some property about not reflecting any light, or something along those lines. I am not saying anything against this definition. If the experts want to define things this way, I'm certainly in no position to say otherwise.  However, ""Black is a color"" should still be a valid statement. My shirt is 'black.' I'm not a color-physicist, but I'm almost certain that it does not completely absorb the full spectrum of colors. If I wanted to be totally correct, I would have to say: ""My shirt is a color that very nearly approximates black."" (Disproving this would be a very easy way to CMV!)  There are enough black-colored items in the world for this to be ridiculous. Thus, it's only logical that when we are casually talking to other humans, and mention the word 'black,' it can be assumed that we're referring to this close-enough faux-black, which does reflect (I'd assume) some light, and thus is totally a color.   The argument for white follows similarly.  Edit: I'm not saying that it's wrong to say that black and white aren't colors. I'm saying that it's okay to say that they are, in certain contexts.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

EDIT 3: All in all I think my anger towards modern day 'trigger happu tumblrinas' has somewhat subsided and Im beginning to understand that we cant scruitinise how everybody feels and that some people are stronger than others like one user said and that the effects of triggers on some people can be deadly.   Thank you all! :)  ----  In 7th and 8th grade I was a snob. This was probably because I am the youngest of five siblings and was fairly better looking than my classmates (before the acne, bad eyesight and crooked teeth kicked in) among other things.    I realised this because of the way my classmates talked about me and treated me and I took the summer of 8th grade to transform into somebody else. I do not recall how exactly I did it but I did. Everybody was surprised, myself included, that the transformation was permanent and genuine.  Sadly, I was no longer a bitch but a pushover instead. I was bullied shortly after and had a horrible 8 or so years until I graduated from university. During those 8 or so years, my first love died in a car crash, my parents had a terrible accident leaving my mother unable to walk for a year, of course I picked up smoking, I started to serial-date guys and their treatment to me kept getting progressively worse all while I tried to do well at university because it was getting too expensive for my parents to pay for and getting a job wasn't enough for me to sustain myself.  Add to the above a religious struggle between myself, my society and my own mother who didn't talk to me for three months while I lived in the same house as her because of my religious and romantic choices (I was dating a black guy), and you get a fairly broken person.  I didn't trust anyone, I was naive, nervous, insecure, a people pleaser, somewhat promiscuous and a smoker. I did things I never thought I'd do and was put in situations I never wanted to be placed in.   I was even ashamed of my own psychologist whom I never went back to visit after a couple of sessions because of how fucked up I was.  My issues seem trivial but these are just the things that I haven't blocked out. My view does apply to individuals who have gone through everything but EXTREME trauma.   My POINT is: How can I, and so many people who have gone through worse, emerge as functional if not even better people than we were because of what we went through by using our own logic and reasoning, the help of others, counselling and other resources, while others simply act as if life is supposed to be somehow tailored for them and that whatever 'triggers' them by making them actually have to THINK about what they went through should somehow be erased from their lives?   Tl;dr: Shit happens in life and people should wade through the pile of crap and come out as functional human beings via their own logic rather than project their issues unto others and claim that whatever 'triggers' them to think about their problems must somehow be banished or banned.     _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Those that do usually suffer from mental illnesses that can cause devestation reflection of an event or memory when brought up. I have ptsd and while i&amp;#39;ve learned to recognize when i will be triggered it still happens sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;there are people that use this term to gain some sort of control over what others say (tumblrsjw&amp;#39;s) and radical feminists of sorts. I first hand know that triggers do exist and i think you should at least acknowledge that they do for some people. sometimes they aren&amp;#39;t even words but a situation that will trigger somebody. a few nights ago someone was insulting me because I told my friend &amp;quot;I hurt myself too much&amp;quot; and that friends sister went onto her account and started saying that i was a drama queen, that i&amp;#39;m a scrawny white guy who can&amp;#39;t even get a job, and other things. That led to a flashback, I am mentally not fit to be in the work force so me &amp;quot;not being able to get a job&amp;quot; was a blow to my self esteem that made me spiral downwards into depressive thoughts and finally i had a flashback. now, this is just an example but let me point out a few key things.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) a part of the reason was because i was already stressed out at the time, i was put into a corner of drama from a few different people before that happened.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) if there was no stress, I may have been able to identify that i may be close to having an episode.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) it wasn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;one word&amp;#39; that caused this, it was a mix of paragraphs of insults.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Triggers do exist and for some they can be far different than others, i do believe someone bringing up rape could &amp;#39;possibly&amp;#39; trigger a victim into a flashback of what happened, but i doubt that just the word alone would cause it. now if they went to see a movie and there was a disturbing rape scene then that would be more of an understandable trigger. In closing, i somewhat agree with you stating people should be able to overcome our issues. but that doesn&amp;#39;t happen out of nowhere in a split second. people struggle for years before they can achieve being better. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Triggers are certainly real. If you&amp;#39;ve experienced a traumatic event like rape or witnessing someone&amp;#39;s death, there will very likely be something that brings you to a state of distress.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem today is that people use the term &amp;#39;triggered&amp;#39; to label normal feelings of sadness, shame, or embarrassment, resulting in someone who actually has a real trigger not being taken seriously when they say they have a trigger.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ex. My ex was really abusive and it took almost 2 years of daily full-blown panic attacks to be able to leave the house calmly. Loud noises would set me off, especially doors slamming(I connected this now to him slamming the door when he was mad and I knew I&amp;#39;d be his punching bag). That was an actual trigger for me, but I would never call it that because of all this bullshit tumblrina garbage about triggers. It actually took me almost a year to ask my parents if they could try not to slam the doors because of this. I felt really bad about asking but they were super understanding.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another, that I still have, is people touching my hair because ONE TIME he yanked me by the hair across the room. I still don&amp;#39;t know why I can&amp;#39;t get over this one, but it&amp;#39;s there and honestly isn&amp;#39;t that big of a deal anymore. I just tell people beforehand to not touch my hair and we&amp;#39;re cool.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Something that IS NOT a &amp;#39;trigger&amp;#39; is when someone calls me a bitch or something that he would call me. I just get pissed off at them like any other normal person would. Sure, it sometimes reminds me of when he would say it, but it isn&amp;#39;t a trigger.  For some people who maybe had an abusive upbringing, certain words like &amp;#39;bitch&amp;#39; COULD be a trigger. But saying it&amp;#39;s a trigger for you just because you don&amp;#39;t like being called a bitch is just crap.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So yes, triggers do still exist. All this BS you see online about people listing their triggers is just not knowing how to identify with their (completely normal) emotions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"CMV: Equal pay in sports for men and woman atheletes cannot be attained currently, due to economic factors associated with demand, not social injustice","I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info: http://www.cnbc.com/id/102811922)   Now, while I agree that pay gaps are a problem in ~~general~~ some fields, sports is a different ballgame (no pun intended). As such, the success of a franchise is dependent on the supporters who pay money for tickets, gear, etc. If we were to look at attendance figures for the National Woman's Soccer League (NWSL) for 2014 compared to Major League Soccer (MLS), we see a huge disparity in people attending games.   Of course, this translates over to other leagues. The NBA draws more people than the WNBA, both live and TV ratings. The revenue of the NFL is exponentially greater than the Independent Woman's Football League.   I'm not here to provide solutions to this, or look into why the mentality of America draws more into guy sports. Yes, I think that ladies should be paid equally. ~~I also think ladies have the ability to play all sports as good as men do, if not better.~~ And of course, ladies have as much of a right to play in any sport and play it professionally. But (and yes here comes a South Park reference) ""...you can't expect people to watch."" My conclusion: the pay gap in sports is a consequence of economic revenue, rather than social injustice.   Open to any replies and criticism.  EDIT: This is awesome and I thank you all for your input. You all taught me that there is a physical difference in athleticism between men and women. And that the pay gap is exaggerated. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your arguments are perfectly valid. Of course NBA players are going to be paid more than WNBA players as long as there are more people watching the NBA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But take a step back and ask yourself, why do more people watch the NBA than the WNBA?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The chief claim is that men are better than women at sports, and we want to watch the best teams. While it&amp;#39;s true that men&amp;#39;s teams outperform women&amp;#39;s teams, it&amp;#39;s ridiculous to say that we only want to watch the best teams. Some fans choose college games over professional because they&amp;#39;re more exciting. Fans of the Mets fall in love with their team despite their obvious inferiority to the Yankees. And I, for one, prefer women&amp;#39;s soccer to men&amp;#39;s because the USWNT actually wins major tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The truth is, people watch the teams they watch because that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re accustomed to. It&amp;#39;s what their friends watch, what&amp;#39;s discussed on the news, what draws crowds and earns parades. So the lack of pay, the lack of press, the lack of attention is something of a self-fulfilling prophesy. As long as we say no one cares about women&amp;#39;s sports, no one will care about women&amp;#39;s sports.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you change the narrative to promote equal coverage, women&amp;#39;s sports will draw equal attention. Just look at tennis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I also think ladies have the ability to play all sports as good as men do, if not better&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hate to break it to you, but they aren&amp;#39;t even comparable.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The womens national teams from some of the top countries in soccer will almost always get beat by mens U-17 U-18 or U-19.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The US national womens team scrimmaged the U-17 boys in 2012 and were beat 8-2.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Other top countries had similar results, and this is just what I know from soccer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: Lying to the FBI shouldn't be a crime unless it actually covers something up.,"Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001)  It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to *five years in prison.*  Under the current law, it is a very serious felony to make any materially false statement to any federal agent.  This law is routinely abused by the government to give them leverage over defendants.  [Ken White at Popehat describes how:](http://popehat.com/2011/12/01/reminder-oh-wont-you-please-shut-up/)  &gt;Here's how it works. The feds identify some fact that they can prove. It need not be inherently incriminating; it might be whether you were at a particular meeting, or whether you talked to someone about the existence of the investigation. They determine that they have irrefutable proof of this fact. Then, when they interview you, they ask you a question about the fact, hoping that you will lie. Often they employ professional questioning tactics to make it more likely you will lie — for instance, by phrasing the question or employing a tone of voice to make the fact sound sinister. You — having already been foolhardy enough to talk to them without a lawyer — obligingly lie about this fact. Then, even though there was never any question about the fact, even though your lie did not deter the federal government for a microsecond, they have you nailed for a false statement to a government agent in violation of 18 USC 1001. To be a crime under Section 1001, a statement must be material — but the federal courts have generally supported the government's position that the question is not whether a false statement actually did influence the government, but whether it was the sort of false statement that could have influenced the government.  &gt;Hence, the government's chickenshit false statement trap works — even though the government agents set it up from the start. Now, however weak or strong their evidence is of the issue they are investigating, they've got you on a Section 1001 charge — a federal felony. In effect, they are manufacturing felonies in the course of investigations.  I think there should be no crime here unless it can be proven that the falsehood actually impeded an investigation in a meaningful manner.  Also, I think the penalty should be much less severe, more like a misdemeanor.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The law makes a misrepresentation of a &lt;strong&gt;material&lt;/strong&gt; fact illegal. This means that the prosecutor has to demonstrate that the statement was false and that the false statement mattered to the investigation in a meaningful way. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So I don&amp;#39;t think lying to the FBI is a crime in the case where the lie does not matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I looked into this on Lexis with a quick search because your question is an interesting one!  What I found is a large body of case law annotating § 1001 and reversing convictions for lack of materiality.  Upon a reading of these cases I do not believe that your example here: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;They ask questions which they know the answers to, can prove are lies, &lt;strong&gt;and which the only purpose of asking is to get a 1001 charge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;particularly because of the bolded portion, would support a conviction.  In other words, I believe the materiality requirement is taken quite seriously by the courts and acts as a safeguard which in most cases would prevent the abuse you are concerned about.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are an awful lot of cases dealing with this issue, published and unpublished, but here are a few quotes I thought most relevant and concise:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;[T]he purpose of the materiality requirement of section 1001 is to exclude trivial falsehoods from the purview of the statute, since false statements that lack the capacity to influence a determination required to be made [by the agency] are too trivial to violate the statute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;United States v. Wheeler&lt;/em&gt;, 247 Fed. Appx. 558, 560 (5th Cir. 2007)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the statutory history, it is evident that section 1001 was not intended to reach all false statements made to governmental agencies and departments, but only those false statements that might support fraudulent claims against the Government, or that might pervert or corrupt the authorized functions of those agencies to whom the statements were made. Typical of the kind of statements that are within the purview of section 1001 are false reports of crime made to federal law enforcement agencies that may engender groundless federal investigations.  The statute was not intended to embrace oral, unsworn statements, unrelated to any claim of the declarant to a privilege from the United States or to a claim against the United States, given in response to inquiries initiated by a federal agency or department, except, perhaps, where such a statement will substantially impair the basic functions entrusted by law to that agency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;United States v. Bedore&lt;/em&gt;, 455 F.2d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir. 1972)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deciding whether a statement is &amp;quot;material&amp;quot; requires the determination of at least two subsidiary questions of purely historical fact: (a) &amp;quot;what statement was made?&amp;quot; and (b) &amp;quot;what decision was the agency trying to make?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;United States v. Gaudin&lt;/em&gt;, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (U.S. 1995)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So if the FBI is asking you a question &amp;quot;which the only purpose of asking is to get a 1001 charge,&amp;quot; then a false response could not be material.  The state would need to prove that they were required to make some determination (in the case of the FBI, the resolution of a criminal investigation), that they asked you something in furtherance of the investigation, and that you knowingly gave a false response calculated to deceive them in a manner that would influence the outcome of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lots of legalese in there but I&amp;#39;m happy to discuss or post more!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: There is no such thing as good frozen pizza.,"Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible.  There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as the worst pizza you can find in a restaurant.  I have searched for years trying to find frozen pizza that's half as good as even Little Caesar's, but to no avail.  I've come to terms with the fact that every variety has low-quality sauce and not enough cheese.  What I can't stand, however, and definitely the most common flaw, is the terrible, *terrible* crust, which ends up either undercooked or bone dry, without fail.  I understand that pizza can only be properly cooked using a pizza stone, but it completely baffles me that this is the best we can do without one in 2015.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Totino&amp;#39;s little party pizzas are wonderful. They are admittedly horrible, but they are also wonderfully horrible. It&amp;#39;s like a train wreck in your mouth. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Little Ceasars is also far from the worst pizza you can find from a pizzeria. I stumbled into a place in Chicago that appeared to have not known the difference between salt and sugar when making their sauce. Side note from another place: If you are going to put out garlic salt instead of garlic powder... warn us. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Little Ceasars, Dominoes, Pizza Hut etc. are all mediocre pizza places. Most chains are. But there are definitely some places that long to serve pizza, really longing to have a pizza because they have only heard of them by rough description. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For frozen if you look at the Jacks/ Tombstone/ Red Baron types... these are absolutely what you are talking about. Light on the cheese, heavy on the lack of taste. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These also sell for about $3 a pie. The cost of a slice at a good place. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But you want to move up in quality. So you think Di&amp;#39;giorno or Freschetta.. but these are made by the same companies as the shitty ones listed above with the same idea... which is to make pizza really cheap. Most pizza toppings also don&amp;#39;t survive freezing very well. Which is why there is a lot of compromise in quality. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However if you are in a store that puts a lot of effort and branding into their store brand (Wegmans in the northeast comes to mind)... their frozen pizza, and all of their store branded items are made to re-enforce the brand of the store. Which is why their name is all over the packaging instead of having an &amp;quot;Exclusive brand&amp;quot; like &amp;quot;Everyday essentials&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Those are going to be the frozen pizzas that have the best chance of not just being a decent frozen meal, but also being a decent pizza. Different from a pizzeria but just as good on a quality scale. (The aforementioned Wegmans pizzas always struck me as a little floury and not as greasy as the closest pizzerias to me growing up. But very close to one of the upscale pizzerias I found on Chicago&amp;#39;s Michigan Avenue)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You might want to also look into picking up a frozen pizza (mailed directly to you) from Chicagos &amp;quot;Giordanos&amp;quot;. It is as close as I&amp;#39;ve come to getting good pizzeria quality pizza from frozen. Also about the same cost as getting it in the store.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re not going to get a NYC pizzeria quality pie from frozen though. The hand tossed dough etc. just isn&amp;#39;t replicable in the large scale assembly line demanded by frozen. But then again.. you&amp;#39;re not going to get that NYC quality in most of the country from a pizzeria anyway. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I disagree with you, but this sounds like a personal opinion on taste than an actual viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes little ceasers &amp;quot;hot and ready&amp;quot; Pizzas are not exactly fresh, I have had some shitty pizzas from there (and some amazing ones).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I would say that the delissio rising crust when cooked properly and fresh out of the oven is superior to the lower tier of little ceasers hot and ready pizzas. Mainly because of the immediacy you can eat the pizza from the oven.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yes the frozen crust is always worst. I just don&amp;#39;t eat it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: I don’t see anything wrong with the legalisation of polygamous marriage,"In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the ‘slippery slope’ argument that it’s legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I’m not interested in arguing whether or not this *will* happen, but why it would be a bad thing if it did. This would be within the context of people being allowed to have multiple marriages, you would not automatically be married to your spouse’s other spouse, although you could choose to do this.  While I personally am not interested in polygamy, what's wrong with it?   It's natural for humans to live in groups. 'Tribes' or 'family' whatever you would like to call it. I don't see anything wrong with families that have several adults to act as role models for children. I just can't see why it would be detrimental to children to be raised in that environment.  To be allowed to marry you need to be a consenting adult and in being one people can make their own relationship decisions. As long as there isn't a sex bias (e.g. men can have many wives but not the other way around), then I think that people can make their own decision about whether a polygamous relationship is something they want. They retain the right to get divorced if their spouse marries someone else when they want a monogamous marriage, just like people retain the right to get a divorce if their spouse cheats on them.  People sometimes argue against polygamous marriages saying that people are already legally allowed to have polygamous relationships, why get married? Because of the legal privileges associated with it? When I get married the legal benefits of being married are going to be way down on the list of reasons. Getting married is a way to show your love for someone.   A big argument going against it is that the legality of it would be very complex. I don’t think that’s necessarily the case. If you died your possessions would be divided up amongst your spouses. Your children would either go to their other parent or be claimed by a next of kin who wants them, with fitness to look after them being determined by a court of law. As is the case currently with children whose parents die without leaving a will e.g. should they go to uncle A or uncle B? There are lots of examples of legal contracts which are binding to groups of people, why couldn’t this be applied to marriage? It could be encouraged, or even possibly mandatory, to have pre-nuptial agreements which define legal aspects of the marriage relating to property ownership, etc. prior to getting married if you’re married to more than one person. With current spouses also signing this document.  I’m not really that interested in ethical arguments. Why should one person’s ethics determine how other people live their lives? For example, I don’t think I would ever have an abortion for my own personal ethical reasons. That doesn’t mean that I’m against other people having the option.  I'm really interested to know if anyone has any good arguments against polygamous marriages. I think a lot of people are against them for their own personal ethical reasons, because they don’t want one themselves, rather than for an actually good, justifiable reason.  So please try to CMV! I’m going to try to reply to every direct response to me. I get really p***ed off when people cherry-pick arguments and ignore the ones that don't suit them. If there are a lot of responses it may take a while though so please be patient! But in saying that if you reply purely because I’ve committed to responding; if you put forth a low-effort comment you will get a low-effort answer.  Edit: I'm getting a bit tired so off to bed for me before anyone else comments &amp; I feel obliged to stay up and discuss this some more! I will definitely be back so please keep the discussion going!   Edit2: Right, there's a fair few replies so I will be going through them. Although a lot of later comments are using arguments that have been used before I'm still determined to reply to all of them. It may take me a while as I unfortunately have other things that I need to be doing, such is life, so I will get to you eventually!  Edit3: I have finally awarded a delta! Apologies to anyone whose comment I missed, but thank you all for being part of the conversation. It was very entertaining and I definitely feel a lot more informed. So you don't have to scroll down &amp; find the explanation for my delta, I'll give it here:  ""While I still think there is nothing wrong with polygamous relationships &amp; the concept of some sort of legal commitment, this couldn't be marriage. You could have some kind of legally binding partnership with multiple partners which has some of the benefits of marriage, such as recognition of the partnership affecting things like visitation rights and a legal claim to be next of kin, but this wouldn't be the same as marriage as we have it now. It's not so much about when people in the marriage are living together, but if things later needed to be taken apart. There is just no way to predict every possibility for a pre-nuptial agreement, and the situation could get so complex that you couldn't have a standard that could be fallen back on every time.""  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It means the law acknowledges who can visit you in the hospital, make decisions for you if you&amp;#39;re sick, raise your kids if you die or make decisions for them if you&amp;#39;re absent, who can share your bank account and affect your credit rating, and who gets half your stuff in divorce. Marriage is a major change in your rights and responsibilities towards specific other people. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When you can only be married to one person at a time, both people have to consent to it. That changes with polygamy. I agree to marry my wife, but what if later she wants to also marry her boyfriend or girlfriend? Can this third partner make decisions for the children I had with my original wife? Does the third partner get part of the property my wife and I accumulated together if they divorce out? Does their debt affect my credit score? With polygamy, your rights and responsibilities towards specific people can change &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; your consent, if one spouse chooses to marry someone else. And what if the new spouse is also married?. You might end up with a lot of people you don&amp;#39;t know/didn&amp;#39;t choose having the ability to majorly impact your life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit: I see that you respond to these kinds of arguments by suggesting people contract around it, but this isn&amp;#39;t a workable solution for marriage. 1) Ideally, marriages last for the rest of your life. 50+ years. There is just no way to foresee and contract for every situation where you will have the opportunity to impact your spouses over that kind of time span. Marriage is fundamentally accepting the risk of future uncertainties with another person, of having to deal with the unforeseen together. That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s so important that people explicitly agree to the person they take that risk with. They can&amp;#39;t effectively contract for all the unknowns and separate risks, and they might not want to be bound by the exact terms of an agreement they signed 20 years ago anyway. Love lives are not great places for contracts. 2) Even in the seemingly simple areas where you would think you can contract, you can&amp;#39;t. Like with property, income doesn&amp;#39;t stay separated once it comes in  to the household, and in divorce judges try to compensate people who sacrificed career opportunities in service of the family unit. There is no neat way to divide it into fractions or to give that paper fraction actual meaning out of your household property and bank account, and it will inevitably impact the spouse who did not marry the third spouse. Prenups between relatively simple two-spouse marriages are overturned, redrafted, or declared void all the time; the sense of predictability they offer is illusive, especially if you move states (every state has its own divorce laws). They wouldn&amp;#39;t help much at all with polygamous marriages.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Things can go wrong with your spouse, but you consented to the risk by marrying them. Things can go wrong with your children, but you accepted that risk by having and keeping children. Things go wrong with your spouse&amp;#39;s spouse, and you didn&amp;#39;t have to sign up for it to ruin your credit or garnish your wages or otherwise massively impact your life. That&amp;#39;s an issue, and it can&amp;#39;t be easily solved by introducing more contracts into personal relationships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wrong&amp;quot; is a word that pertains to morality. So it&amp;#39;s odd that you don&amp;#39;t want a moral argument. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But anyway:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Is everybody equal in such a marriage? Does it vary depending on the time they&amp;#39;ve been married?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Can new people be added?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How is it structured? Is it 3 women married to a man, do they form a ring, or a mesh?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Related to the above, how does divorce work? Can it fail due to disagreement?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Is there a size limit? What if a whole town decides to get married, imagine the work untangling that will be.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;What if one person is in the hospital and there are two others that can make a life or death decision, and disagree?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;There are practical social issues. Eg, rich man gets himself 20 wives. Enough of that will skew the ratio in the community, resulting in some really pissed off people.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Who do the children belong to?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The court system will probably need an upgrade. We&amp;#39;re talking about dramatically increasing complexity and opportunity for conflict.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t oppose the idea in principle, but the practical issues seem to be tough to solve, and I doubt they&amp;#39;re about to get worked out tomorrow. Maybe as a society in a decade or two we&amp;#39;ll reach some sort of general agreement about what such a thing is supposed to look and work like, but today it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like we&amp;#39;re there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: People have a moral obligation to watch ISIS execution videos to expose them to the true horrors of life under extremist rule.,"Recently I have begun to fell that when news of these executions comes through on the news many people read about it, talk about how awful it is, then move on to the next news story and give the subject little other thought.  I think that watching these videos would have a much greater impact on people and make them more likely to do something to help.  Personally, if I watch videos like this I feel sick and it disturbs me for about half a week.  I cannot forget about them easily.  Just reading about these events does not have this effect and I can forget about the issues relatively quickly.  Secondly I am sure some people cannot visually imagine how horrific these events are.  Being exposed to footage of it will be a shock and a wake up call to how bad life can be for some people.  This in turn will make them more likely to take action.  I will make it plain that I do not think people should be viewing these sorts of videos for entertainment of any kind.  Finally it seems I am not alone, [this article](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/sean-penn-watches-isis-beheading-videos-out-of-moral-obligation-the-problem-is-we-are-not-seeing-enough-of-real-violence-10127603.html) may help you understand my argument better than I can express it.  EDIT:  Some of the responses have made me realise that what I am suggesting would have different effects on different people and as such viewing these videos may not always cause people to act in a positive way as it has with me.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"CMV: If a redlight camera is enough to give a ticket for running a red light, then automatic toll systems should be able to give fines for speeding","The basis of this viewpoint is that a system that does not require an official review (such as automatically giving out tickets for running red lights) would also extend to other laws.  That has set a precedent where it would be legally acceptable to issue fines to other violations without human input.  If a driver passes through toll A, then passes through toll B (10 miles away) after 5 minutes, it's possible to determine the driver's minimum speed as 120 mph. It's possible the driver went faster then paused before they crossed toll B, but it would not be possible for them to have traveled at a legal speed and still pass through toll B within that time.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV: 'Mouse and keyboard' is the superior control scheme for PC gaming.,"I am strictly a PC gamer. I own an XBox controller for my PC and am very interested in the upcoming Steam controller. But I'm hesitant to make the purchase, as I barely use my XBox controller. I have tried several times to get used to playing with a controller - even reinstalling old games and starting with the controller to familiarize myself - and I always go back to 'mouse and keyboard'. Below are the reasons I think 'mouse and keyboard' is the best way to play PC games (really: any game, but K&amp;M is really only an option on the PC).  * The mouse is infinitely more precise than a controller. I can't even imagine playing FPS games with a controller (mostly, I've been playing 3rd-person action games a la *Arkham* and *Tomb Raider*). I know many FPS games use an aim assist system to compensate for the imprecision of a controller. I would rather have a more precise input system than an 'assist' to compensate for the imprecision of my input device.  * Because we use them all the time, a keyboard is intuitive. Most of us use computer keyboards and mice on a daily basis in our work. Every QWERTY keyboard has the same layout. When a game tells me 'press X', I know exactly where X is. Even people who are very familiar with controller layouts haven't spent nearly as much time with that controller as they have with a keyboard and mouse.   * Keyboard and mouse work for *all* games. As I mentioned, I prefer the precision of K&amp;M for FPS games. But I'm also a big-time RTS and strategy gamer (*Total War* are my favorite games) and there's no way I could imagine playing strategy games with a controller. K&amp;M works for everything. I even preferred *Dark Souls* with a K&amp;M - a game that many will say is only playable with a controller.   * I am perfectly comfortable in my computer chair. One of the big advantages I often hear about controllers is the ability to play from the couch. I prefer to be close to my display (I play on a 32in TV and sit about 3 feet back). My keyboard and mouse sit on a laptop desk and my computer chair is very comfortable. I feel more engaged in my games at the distance I sit vs. sitting on the couch.   Why I want my view changed:  * I think the Steam controller looks really cool, but I'm not sure I'd use it. I don't want to make a purchase I won't use.  * Am I missing out on good experiences that only a controller can offer?   * I've got a device I barely use. I would like to use it more, if there are games in which using it would give me a better experience.   Edit: many good suggestions in this thread so far. I'm going to spend a few minutes playing some of the types of games mentioned (stealth, action, driving, etc.) and see if the controller enhances the experience.  Edit 2: Hey everyone. Thanks so much for the discussion. Lots of good points made, but I think the best was made by /u/stoopydumbut, who suggested that using a controller adds an additional level of challenge. Props, also, to all the users who pointed out the genres of games (racing, fighting, flight sims) that I don't play, but benefit from a controller. I am going to make it point to use my controller as often as I can going forward, and am still considering a Steam controller purchase. Thanks, everyone, this was exactly the conversation I wanted to have. Please feel free to keep posting, if you have something new to add. I will keep reading, commenting, and awarding deltas.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

If you&amp;#39;ve ever played GTA or a similar game with a controller, then switched to mouse and keyboard, you probably threw your mouse through your computer in a fit of rage.

I played an action game (probably Tomb Raider) a little while ago, and when an explosion took place off-screen, or sometimes during a cut scene, the controller would vibrate. Coupled with the sound design it really added to the feeling of being &amp;quot;inside&amp;quot; the game.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Edit: You mentioned the Batman games. It&amp;#39;s been a while since I played them, but I think the controller vibrated a little during a silent takedown, mimicking the thug&amp;#39;s struggling. It was cool. It&amp;#39;s hard to explain the value of the sensation in its absence, but it did add some extra enjoyment to the game.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: ""Objectivism"" is the most optimal way to go through life.","I have been a liberal (using the binary American political scale for simplicity) for my entire adult life.  I have advocated for the rights of homosexuals, women, and other groups; however, I do not feel like this stance has benefited me in the slightest.  In fact, given my regional location (the South or Southeast United States) it has probably hurt me personally more than anything.  I have not read Ayn Rand, nor do I ever intend to, as I consider her philosophy to be frankly immoral.  Moral people should look out for their fellow humans.  However, I believe that I would be better served by pursuing my own rational self-interest rather than spending even an ounce of my resources on the betterment of others who will just attribute my good deed to their god anyway most likely.  Donating to charity might prevent a child from dying from cancer, but I am not a child and I don't have cancer, so that extra dollar from my pocket is better spent being used as tax on my latest board game purchase.  This could be extended to other people that I consider friends, but I think it is a better use of my resources for me to aid my own comfort than to save a stranger's life.    Things that will not change my view:    * ""You aren't really describing objectivism! It really is a more nuanced...""     I don't care.  I am not here to argue the definition of objectivism.    * ""My wife/child/other family member was saved by...""   Are you related to me?  Probably not as I have never had these sorts of problems, so I don't care.  It is good that your family member didn't die, but that has nothing to do with me.  * ""What if you needed help?""   I probably wouldn't get it unless I was able to provide it for myself.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

CMV: The only way to change the ignorant is with violence.,"I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my friends or the people who have gone through that with family or people in general.   As I was walking with my date (M) through town, a group of college students started laughing at us for holding hands. As we were walking by, I kept thinking of all the ways I could get them to stop because if they were to laugh at us, who else are they gonna make feel humiliated or disgusting. I felt like a pet. Some play toy. And that my life was humorous to other people.   I can't say that there would be anything to say or do to make them realize that it's normal to appeal to the same sex. I'm ALL FOR education. I believe education makes the world go around and it's so perfect to learn abd understand new things about the world AND be open minded to everything.    However, when I see a group of people act ignorantly, I can't help but clench my fist and think about raising hell in their life. The people they are are the kind that take pleasure in hurting people. Why? Because they want to do it for themselves. They can only think about themselves and that they're more perfect than everyone else.   I sure as hell am not perfect. I resort to violence when it comes down to this topic. But when I hear or see ignorance made to hurt others, like this (https://youtu.be/1df_i26wh-w). I can't help but feel like this ignorance needs to be dealt with a punch in the face. Nobody deserves what I got. And nobody deserves the ignorance others recieve.   Ignorance stems from close mindedness, which is something in this world we don't need. If we were all close minded, we wouldn't have advanced as far as we have. Do we really need more of it in this world? Is it necessary for our survival? I believe so to the extent that when there is an absolutely close minded person,there is an equally absolutely open minded person (the bell curve).   So to deal with these people is to punish them with hurt nowhere near the pain they've inflicted onto people, while still sending a message. CMV   Edit: I know violence won't get me anywhere. Are there any other solutions besides time, education and ignorng other people that can remedy the situation more directly?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what happens when you lose your majority?  When people teach others via violence, the people they teach sometimes learn the intended message and other times learn that you are an oppressor who needs to be punished.  This is what happened to you, and you&amp;#39;d like to impose that violence on the people who hurt you.  All well and good, until the wheel turns (as it always does) and you find yourself in the minority again.  At that point, they&amp;#39;ll be punishing you for your oppression.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Far better to teach the ignorant but allow them to persist in their ignorance if they wish.  They then learn &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; lesson if they won&amp;#39;t learn the intended one.  When the wheel turns, they will therefore be less likely to act violently towards you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning, anecdotal story ahead:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While it&amp;#39;s easy to assume that violence is the easiest answer to a conflict like this, I have a recent personal example (where violence was encouraged) that worked out better bonviolently. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A fried I&amp;#39;d made at school thought I stole weed from his house. He&amp;#39;d recently discovered the online drug market and was experimenting with all kinds of drugs. He was doing everything from ketamine, to LSD, to opiates. You get the idea. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#39;d happened was that he couldn&amp;#39;t find his stuff as soon as I&amp;#39;d left. The next time I went over, they were having a party. As soon as I&amp;#39;d walked in, this guy (high on percs) starts yelling &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s the fucker who stole my dabs&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d heard that he thought that from someone, but I thought it&amp;#39;d be ridiculous for him to accuse me because he should know I&amp;#39;d never do something like that. I found out at that moment that he really thought I&amp;#39;d steal from him. He got up, got in my face, and started screaming at me calling me a theif, a liar, all while there&amp;#39;s a good 20 people around staring. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I stayed calm the entire time. I knew I could resort to violence, but I&amp;#39;d always been taught nonviolence will get you farther. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I removed myself from the situation, calmly told him I&amp;#39;m sorry that he thinks I&amp;#39;d do something like that, but that I&amp;#39;d leave. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Banned from the house, I found out later that he&amp;#39;d found what he thought I stole waaay under a couch. When we head back to school in August he wants to talk and apologize to me for everything and clear the air. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now I could&amp;#39;ve punched him in the face one of the multiple times he tried to get physical. I could&amp;#39;ve screamed back. I could&amp;#39;ve called him a drug addicted fuck, beat the shit out of him, and still be seen in the right. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Because I resorted to not using violence, and gave it time rather than resorting to getting physical, I may have one less burnt bridge. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether or not he&amp;#39;s a friend worth aging is another topic, but I feel this story sets up a good example for why nonviolence is a more desirable route. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: Our local bridge's rails should not be heightened to prevent suicide off the bridge into the water,"I think it's a dystopic society that would want to prevent people from leaving this world. If someone wants to go, they should be able to. If there is any meaning in calling life ""free"" then one should freely be able to leave at their discretion.  Raising the rails could be argued for as a preventative measure for someone throwing someone else off the bridge, but that's not what I'm interested in. Should it be raised as a preventative for suicide.  I don't think suicide is as much of a problem as we think. ""People shouldn't commit suicide"" - this belief stems from Middle Age christian era and seems to have been passed on from generation to generation. I don't have any scientific knowledge, in fact I don't think there can even be any scientific knowledge that can imply a reasoning such as this. It seems to me to be an idea that could be true and also may not be true.  Further, who am I to judge that someone else's life with someone else's perspective that it is always wrong to kill oneself? Surely even with a simple cost-benefit analysis it can sometimes be ok.  I still understand the sadness that arises when someone does it, but it's not because they've done it, it's because of where they must've been to want to do it.  Sure, I'll admit that raising them may prevent a few cases, but someone that is intent on doing will still climb over it. But I don't know for sure that it will, there's no evidence to my knowledge that supports this. Then there's also the side that raising the bars will make the initial altitude higher and increase the acceleration of the falling person increasing the likelihood of death from the impact.  For those who don't want to change my mind, I'm interested in hearing your arguments that support my opinion also.  Thanks! _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

They say that there is often a small window between the thought I&amp;#39;m going to kill myself and the person going over the bridge. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you can delay the time between someone making the choice and then that person jumping often the person doesn&amp;#39;t want to kill themselves because most people don&amp;#39;t want to kill themselves. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They are dealing simply with a very temporary problem in a very permanent way. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Side note: did the other suicide post lead at all to you making this CMV?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine there was a person with depression who was about to commit suicide. Imagine that this person, if they took antidepressants, would go on to lead a perfectly healthy life. Imagine if this person is totally ignorant of the wonders of antidepressants. Would it still be ok to let that person commit suicide purely because he doesn&amp;#39;t know there is a cure for his ailment at the time of his suicide? I don&amp;#39;t think so. Somebody should not commit suicide simply because they don&amp;#39;t know there is a cure out there. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is, of course a huge over-simplification but the principle still stands. Stories of people being &amp;quot;talked down from the ledge&amp;quot; are commonplace. &lt;a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/lookout/years-later-cop-reunites-suicidal-man-saved-golden-171522199.html""&gt;Here&amp;#39;s one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the above case, it was a man who talked him down from the ledge but &lt;a href=""http://www.stopthetragedy.org/Lifelinepositiononbridgebarriers.pdf?attredirects=0""&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that this is not the most effective means of doing so. &amp;quot;Decades of research clearly demonstrate that bridge barriers effectively prevent suicides (e.g., Beautrais, 2007; O’Carroll &amp;amp; Silverman, 1994).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think that the way you present suicide implies that all the people who commit suicide want to go and absolutely none are like the examples shown earlier. Many people are &amp;quot;talked down from the ledge&amp;quot; and go on to live fruitful, healthy lives without another suicide attempts because they were able to get to the help they needed because of some preventative measure. You could argue that these cases are few but they are greater than 1.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What if those barriers only ever save one life. Would it be worth it? Well, the way you present suicide you seem to imply that all the people who commit suicide definitely want to go. They have done the cost-benefit analysis and decided that suicide is the only way. If somebody, then, is committing suicide purely through ignorance of a cure at the time, your morality should dictate that we should do everything in our power to stop that person from jumping. Or at least delay their attempt until they&amp;#39;ve done the cost-benefit analysis and realised jumping is the best way to go. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t want to view barriers as a suicide-prevention device, then look at them as a way for delaying an impulsive jumper&amp;#39;s attempt until they have made a fully-informed decision. I think under those circumstances there presence on bridges is acceptable. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Auto manufacturers should make their vehicles' headlights shut off when the car shuts off,"Headlights are mostly useful for improving the driver's vision while driving in low-light conditions and for increasing the visibility of the driver's car in low-light or foggy conditions. While stationary, the only non-malicious use of a car's headlights (I.E. other than parking the car and turning on the headlights/high beams in an attempt to confuse or blind oncoming drivers) is to light up an area for somebody on foot. However, a flashlight would be much more effective for this purpose.  With the lack of usefulness of stationary headlights in mind, cars should be designed such that the headlights turn off when the car is turned off in order to prevent the car battery from running down.  Edit: To clarify, I don't feel that this behavior needs to be the *only* way to activate headlights. I see no issue with there being an option to have the headlights on when the car is off, but I feel that the ""auto"" mode (headlights on when car is on, headlights off when car is off) should be at least as accessible as the always-on mode in all vehicles that have both.

"CMV: I don't think I have to go any faster on a highway, and people trying to cut ahead of me going 90+ miles are reckless and putting me and everyone else driving in danger.","This is a problem I always encounter when I drive on a highway. The speed limit in the most used highway where I live is 70. I usually go at around that speed (give or take 3-5 miles). Now, I have noticed that an alarming amount of people that are driving behind me get impatient and just speed on ahead of me (which is perfect, if there is no danger of crashing). I usually notice that these people are going at at *least* 90+ mph, and they don't slow down.  This just angers me so much, I feel like I'm constantly being put at risk by boneheads that are too impatient to drive on the speed limit.  I commented this to a lot of friends and most of them tell me that I'm wrong, because ""nobody follows the speed limit"", and I'm going too slow. They say it's perfectly fine to drive at 90+ miles on a highway which indicates to drive at 20 miles less. I don't know anymore. Am I wrong?

Traffic is also generally safer when there is little variance in speed, ie everyone is going about the same speed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It seems intuitive to me that a larger variance in speed of different drivers would contribute to more accidents than a slower speed. Ie, if everyone was going 90 +/-5, there would be less accidents than 80 +/- 15. I have no stats to back that up and I very well might be wrong, but from my experience I believe this to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If that is correct, in order for the population to have the safest possible driving, people should drive as close to the average as possible. Driving too far under will cause more accidents.

CMV: Tips at restaurants should not be based upon a percentage of the cost of the meal.,"The old tipping debate. I generally side with those that want to end the mostly American practice of tipping about 20% percent of the cost of the meal. That may never happen.  What bothers me, is the idea that the server's time is as only as valuable as the cost of what's on the plate. If I get a $8 plate of eggs at Waffle House I am to tip about 2 dollars. If I am to get a $50 steak at the local trendy restaurant or steak house, I am to tip over $10?   I understand that *generally* at a more expensive restaurant I will spend more time there making the servers work a longer time on my needs. And they are usually expected to be more knowledgeable about the menu. And the bus has to make thing look better and the bartender has to know more cocktails....  But it seems to me, the tipping tradition has propped up a non-egalitarian system where the young and attractive can rake in a decent pay check because expensive restaurants can be exclusive about hiring, and others, especially the older who probably did not really want to be stuck server their whole career, are left taking the 15% on my cheap dinner.  If I go in simply for a beer and a dessert, I try to tip above 50%. For ""affordable"" dinners I try to tip 25-30%. For nicer dinners I usually end up tip 15-20%. Truly bad service and I will only tip 10-15%. And if they have a truly helpful suggestion at that trendy restaurant I may tip over 20%.....  I think we should move to a system based more on how long you are in the restaurant, and the amount of attention your visit actually needed, rather than a simple percentage completely isolated from the nuance of the service.  But the whole system just makes me feel guilty.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying I tip well even when ordering at a counter.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;i somewhat agree with you But if it is based on time and I buy a beer and pay with exact cash shouldn&amp;#39;t I be paying next to nothing? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At a restaurant you are tipping a waiter, bus boys, cooks, and hosts. The reason it works is at nicer restaurants there are more employees doing the same job. You pay more for your meal and your higher tip goes to more people. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Obviously the best case scenario would be to just have a livable wage. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here is an interesting thought though. In cities that are raising their minimum wages to $15 an hour am I still going to be expected to tip well? It seems to be that food service employees are going to be ridiculously well compensated for a job that takes no skills. Especially in San Fransisco where restaurants are required to also provide health care for their employees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am of two minds about tipping. On the one hand, it&amp;#39;s getting very confusing with different people wanting tips, mainly because no one can live on minimum wage, and there being different rates depending on the work they do. On the other hand, I&amp;#39;ve traveled to places that didn&amp;#39;t have tipping, and the service is not nearly as good. So I think tipping encourages good service, because the reward is immediate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, if we have tipping, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s unfair to base the amount on the total cost of the meal. High-end restaurants with high-end prices tend to hire for quality far more than low-end restaurants do. So in the server business, you start at a cheap chain restaurant and work your way up. By the time you get to the higher end restaurants, service is a high priority. Part of the service is that you are invisible but provide for the diner&amp;#39;s needs without being intrusive. Therefore, you don&amp;#39;t need to be particularly attractive, or young. You need to look well groomed, and keep your hair under control for health department reasons. But you don&amp;#39;t have to be beautiful or handsome. You have to be good.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, waiters at really high-end restaurants do not have four or five tables to serve at one time. They have one or two.They will stand somewhere that you won&amp;#39;t notice them and watch, so they can be there exactly when you want them, and even before you realize you want something, and they already have it. So they have to make more money per table to make it worth it. They are not running around as much as the waiter at Chili&amp;#39;s, but they are exercising skill as they anticipate needs. And if there were no tipping, you could rest assured that the high-end restaurants would pay their wait staff more so that they could get the best. And you would pay them more in your bill.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Despite its flaws, the current system does account for skill and level of attention. The no-tip system, in my experience, results in lesser levels of service, but would mean that better waiters got paid better at restaurants that demand a higher level of service. A flat-rate or time-based system like you propose would be more complicated than a no-tip system and still not account for the differences between having to flag your waiter down at Chili&amp;#39;s to ask for more ketchup and having your needs anticipated at a high-end restaurant. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"CMV: Coffee is overrated, the effects received are negligible and often a placebo, and people who say they like the taste are lying to themselves.","I understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do.  Every child growing up seems to desire coffee, but only because it's age restricted, similar to alcohol/tobacco. Now I don't have a PhD in psychology or anything, but there is evidence beyond proof that people want what they can't have. It's just human nature, and I feel like it's what's behind the longterm desire for coffee in that something I was once barred from is now freely enjoyed and encouraged. It doesn't help that many people jack their cups with sugars and creams which at a certain point require speculation as to which substance is actually fueling your perceived energy boost.  I consider myself to be very openminded, especially when it comes to substances put into the body for recreational purposes (I'll leave it at that) but I can't seem to see eye-to-eye to my friends that have been religiously trying to convert me all these years.  The extent of my coffee experience would be instant coffee growing up at home (parents weren't 'connoisseurs' by any iteration of the term but were both pretty addicted to), pretentious (shots fired) coffee shops that my fiends would literally drag me to, and the occasional tinder date Starbucks run in which I would just end up getting the vanilla bean frappe 90% of the time, which is delicious by the way.  It seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.  Could that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee? Has my past experienced not done justice to an entire culture that is coffee? I mean people spend hundreds of dollars a year on it, and for what? Change my view.    _____","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are basically just saying &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t like the taste of coffee, how can anyone like the taste of coffee?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Personally, I don&amp;#39;t like the taste of tomatoes, I think they are slimey, gross and just repulsive. I don&amp;#39;t think that anyone who likes tomatoes is &amp;quot;lying to themselves.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since you are saying that people like it because they are forbidden it as a child we can compare like to like. I like the taste of certain types of beer. My friend likes Guinness, I hate Guinness, neither he nor I are &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;lying to ourselves.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As far as being placebo? Caffeine is a stimulant, it has the effects of a stimulant, it will keep you up, alert, etc. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m sure there &lt;strong&gt;may be some additional placebo effects&lt;/strong&gt; from drinking coffee beyond what is produced by caffeine, but, it&amp;#39;s still a stimulant and there is a noticeable, non-placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have access to a really good coffee shop near you, the coffee itself can taste fruity and creamy depending on the variety. I take my coffee black with a little sugar. I enjoy the taste but I like bitter drinks (craft beer). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Personally I try not to drink caffeine but I have found that waking up early for my job makes it very hard to focus and to keep my energy up without coffee. There have been many studies on the effects of caffeine and I can&amp;#39;t recall seeing one that said the effects of caffeine are a placebo&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: 51 ""New"" Gender Options are Over-the-Top and Useless.","Awhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I am *not* against anyone in the LGBT community and welcome the idea of gay marriage and things similar. However, I've never really been on-board with all these new genders.   Anyway, some of the terms that come to mind are *Agender* and *Androgynous*. The mean the same thing, to not identify as any gender, so why are they two separate words? *Genderfluid* and *Bigender* seem completely redundant too - so, why even have them? I'm also not entirely sure why people can't just dress the way they want to while remaining whatever sex they were given at birth.   Does it really matter if a man dresses as a woman? Does he really have to be classified as *gender-fluid* because it really just seems like a word that would be less blunt than *cross-dressing*. Again, I have nothing against that, but it seems like people are trying to make other words to someone glorify what they're doing.  Also, what's the deal with ""cis""?  * Cis-female. * Cis-male. * Cis-man. * Cis-woman. * Cisgender.  If the definition of ""cis"" is basically people acting within the confines of their gender, why can't they *just* be called women and men? Why do they have to have a special name? Considering that people are giving away names to things that already exist, it seems really indicative of how strong other words in their dictionary are (see: gender-fluid and bi-gender redundancy).  Again, I can't stress this enough, I have no issues with people being who they want to be and how they want to be that. It just seems overly unnecessary to have a million new Facebook gender options for things that clearly overlap each-other. A lot of this also seems more of a ploy for attention, not someone *actually* identifying as something.  With that being said, am I just seeing this the wrong way? I get incredibly annoyed when someone tells me they're ""gender-fluid"" or ""cis-female"". It makes me believe that I may be seeing this the wrong way - or maybe these terms really are inessential and pointless?  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

CMV: McDonald's was not responsible for the injuries of the lady who spilled coffee over herself,"I've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the support for the lady.   The jury found McDonald's to be 80% responsible and awarded several million dollars compensation, which was later reduced to about 600 000 dollars, and then later settled.  Acording to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants) and another [website](http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm) here are the abridged facts of the incident as I understand them.  * coffee was ordered at a drive through window * coffee was handed to Liebeck * Liebeck's son drove off * they stopped so Liebeck could add sugar * Liebeck spilled the entire cup over her lap, hence severely injuring her  My argument that it is not McDonald's responsibility is that she had been safely handed the coffee. The transaction was complete and she had control. If the coffee had been spilled during the handover I would view it the other way around.  There are two arguments that I reject. I reject that the severity of the injury affects the responsibility. Comments such as ""have you seen those injuries, they're horrific, she had to be reconstructed"" are common. This is true, they were appalling injuries. But I think this is a strawman argument because my point is that it was not McDonald's responsibility after the handover, not that the injuries were minor.   I reject that the coffee was too hot. These are hot drinks. It's obvious to me, and I would hope anyone who intends to drink such a drink that it would be hot and care should be given. Perhaps my culture views it differently. I grew up in England, and here 9 and ten year olds make tea for themselves; kettles boil water and then that water is poured into a teapot / cup. We know from a young age that this is dangerous and extreme care must be taken when handling such hot water. Indeed, in a similar UK case against McDonald's regarding hot coffee, the judge ruled that McDonald's was not responsible, one of the reasons being that people expect hot drinks to be hot and should make reasonable safety measures themselves. I do not believe Americans don't realise hot water is dangerous.   If anyone would like to comment, I'd be happy to elaborate further. I look forward to having interesting discussion.  **EDIT:** *Thank you for your replies so far, I'm working my way through replying to them.*  **EDIT:** *Thank you for your comments and discussion. I have awarded deltas to comments that highlighted arguments that I had not considered. My view is still that McDonald's were not liable for any costs. I have come to the conclusion that the discrepancy is due to a difference in cultural expectations of temperature of served hot drinks. I was brought up in a culture where water is regularly boiled at home and hence all children learn how to be careful around just-boiled water. As mentioned above, that is part of the reason why an almost identical case was thrown out in the UK.*  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This principle isn&amp;#39;t applied in all jurisdictions, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; used in the jurisdiction wherein the incident and the lawsuit took place.&lt;br/&gt; According to this doctrine the plaintiff can be awarded damages even if they themselves contributed to the damage.    &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So taking all of the evidence that McDonald&amp;#39;s was &lt;em&gt;to some extent&lt;/em&gt; responsible, they were also to some extent liable.    &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the over-heated coffee they carried some liability; but I think more importantly they intentionally down-played the warning on the coffee cup. That was probably done to make the cup more aesthetically pleasing, but it nonetheless seats them with some responsibility.&lt;br/&gt; They took their own warning to their customers and made it negligible so that the cup would be attractive.    &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think it can be argued that McDonald&amp;#39;s carried zero responsibility for the incident and the law in that state makes it clear that they are therefore liable &lt;em&gt;to some extent&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I see it, you&amp;#39;re arguing from the wrong stand point. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your view is mostly based around the notion that customers should expect a hot drink to be hot, and therefore handle it carefully. This is logical and thus at a first glance seems like an argument in the context of this lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, it is irrelevant because it is not mutually exclusive with the notion of serving (easily tippable, might I add) hot drinks that will not cause severe (3rd degree) burns in the event of the cup tipping over. Something we can very easily observe when you look at just about any other establishment that sells coffee.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The loose thread in your reasoning is as follows: should customers handle hot drinks carefully? Yes. However, should establishments sell hot drinks in handheld, plastic cups that will cause you 3rd degree burns if spilled? No. And the thing is that there is a very extensive middle ground in here, to which all establishments selling this sort of items adhere to.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For this reason, McDonald&amp;#39;s was found liable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
"CMV: The simplest, cheapest, most effective way to improve society would be encouraging and participating in more public interaction between strangers","I am not here to make an exhaustive (and certainly biased) list of what I believe is wrong with society/culture (specifically in America, where I live), but to suggest that all the issues could be moderated (if not necessarily solved) by establishing new attitudes and behaviors in public spaces and around strangers. It seems that my generation (recently dubbed, by some, the Oregon Trail Generation, existing between Gen-X and Millennials) was the first to be raised with explicit ""stranger danger"" warnings and programs like DARE, latchkey centers, etc. Since then, the stigma against strangers has only increased and our default attitude turned closer to fear and suspicion.  It would take a long time to dissect the various causes for this notable shift but at least some are clear: Modern media more constantly and sensationally depicts the negative potentials (often real, but sometimes illusory). The rapid growth of the internet and technology has given negative individuals access to our private lives and information (think 419 and phishing scams). A more connected and globalized society has shown us a greater number of negative outcomes (even when those numbers do not reflect a higher percentage or likelihood).  I'm certainly not blaming technology for this, as the way we use it exists in a complex cycle of innate habits/desires, the capability of the technology, and a reinforcing feedback loop. Many of the issues are, however, exacerbated by technology because it gives us the ease to disseminate fear-based messages (which are naturally stronger than positive messages) and provides us with a secluded alternative to the public sphere. We can easily find people who agree with us, information that fulfills our search, and interactions that provide some positive stimulus without ever having to interact with strangers.  That said, the insular world we have created puts incredible distance between individuals even as it purports to bring us closer together. While it is wonderful that a person can find a community that shares and validates their unique interests, we are relieved of the burden of having to consider and integrate difference. Further, these habits have not only stratified society economically but subdivided it in all directions. For all the openness of the modern world, we are actually strengthening in-groups by creating social networks and dating sites that cater to race, religion, profession, etc. (I've been looking for research to support this statement, but precious little has been done.)  As I see it, nearly all of these issues would be alleviated by reinstating the public sphere as a place for interaction between strangers. I'm not saying you should talk to every person you see out and about and we definitely need to educate vulnerable groups/individuals on keeping safe (and have a police force capable of adequately and appropriately handling the situation). We could begin simply by discussing the arts when encountered in a public setting (ask a stranger what they thought of a movie instead of just your friends) and discussing news in public forums (why can't people in Boston Common have a conversation about the recent trial?). We should be more open to finding all kinds of relationships randomly, whether on the subway or in the grocery store.   Obviously, there will be lots of discomfort and inconvenience. You shouldn't talk to everyone, all the time, and it will take each individual an amount of trial and error to gauge what is and isn't appropriate. Still, the general outcome seems to be only positive. For most of the us, the worst outcome is encountering more annoying people, but I actually think ""wait til you hear about this guy I talked to at the gas station"" is more interesting than ""I went to the gas station and listened to this podcast that confirmed what I was already thinking."" We would also be afforded new (that is, old) ways of dealing with issues that arise from online dating and MRA/SJW/etc. communities.  Many people will chalk my attitude up to a rural midwest upbringing as a white male. No, I did not grow up in an area where gangs, drugs, etc. were likely encountered on any sort of regular basis; no, I was not at risk of racial or sexual harassment and related violence. I am, though, familiar with those experiences second-hand (my university had students from 35 states and 42 countries, so I was exposed to an extensive array of different cultures/attitudes/experiences) and actually believe my solution may alleviate them to some extent. A portion of perpetrators (admittedly the ones likely to do the least damage) may change their attitude and behavior because of their increased interactions with others. The worst offenders are likely to attempt/commit their actions regardless. Potential victims may actually gain allies and confidence from increased interaction (one specific ex: women who become comfortable approaching and speaking with men in public are more likely to find men who don't just want sex/dating and the women will demonstrate that they interesting, complex, equal people rather than just joining online groups intent on telling us they are interesting, complex, equal people).  Am I really miscalculating the ratio of benefit/danger? Is there some insurmountable barrier to public interaction I'm not considering? Is this happening more often than I realize but just not in my area?   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Or a park. Or any place where people already interact. The crappy thing is that like minded people already gather in public areas and discuss whatever they want. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Forcing conversation with someone who doesn&amp;#39;t want to have it isn&amp;#39;t a solution either, I&amp;#39;ve never walked up to someone to ask, &amp;quot;so what&amp;#39;d you think about that art exhibit down the street?&amp;quot; because outside of the internet/clubs that&amp;#39;s a socially blunt move. Awkward experiences talking to strangers doesn&amp;#39;t lead to empathy. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d flip what you&amp;#39;re saying, and say that being digitally connected is the best way to talk to strangers. True strangers. Homogenous strangers from your neighborhood you meet at a park are more likely to share your views due to geography than, say, you and I would. I&amp;#39;ve never been schooled more than when I learned something, and got someone else&amp;#39;s perspective that my neighbor just never could have had. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yes we are more likely to listen to things that confirm our world views, but this is a step forward from information being so unavailable that you could hold a world view without it ever being added to, corrected or confirmed. We are however more likely to search for information that interests us online, where I&amp;#39;ve found not just differing views, but international views and local views on literally anything and everything. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be region specific, but folks around where I live (Northern Suburbs of the City of Atlanta) stop and chat with one another all the time. It&amp;#39;s difficult to walk on the local college campus without being dragged into some conversation or other. That&amp;#39;s actually a problem, normally when you&amp;#39;re walking you are &lt;em&gt;going somewhere&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;need to be there at a specific time&lt;/em&gt;. Getting drawn into a conversation that requires significant time to come to a bigger realization and a better understanding of the world isn&amp;#39;t necessarily the best idea in those situations. After all, you have to choose between meeting your engagements (getting to class/work/parties on time) or having a chat. The same sort of thing can happen (but happens less often) on Kennesaw Main Street or the Marietta Square. As someone who has been there, chatting with people in public can become very expensive rather quickly in terms of time and effort. Is it worth the benefits for the costs in time and effort? That&amp;#39;s a the kind of thing where each person has a different answer. It&amp;#39;s worth it for some folks and not worth it to others.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Last year I was up in Connecticut to see my sister, and I&amp;#39;m used to small talk on the street and such. Saying &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;have a nice day&amp;quot; are essentially involuntary responses for me at this point. People looked at me like I was crazy. So, it was definitely a local culture specific thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV:If Women have the right to be Pro-Choice then Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood.,"Hello CMV!  First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). This has potentially shaped my ideas on the matter but I thought I'd throw it out there. Please don't judge me on my politics but on the content of the CMV. I believe that in a free society people have the right to decide whether they should keep a baby or not, women have the right to abort or raise a child. However I believe that men deserve the same right after sex with regards to the child (it takes two to tango). If a mother decides to keep the child then the father deserves the right to accept, or opt out of, fatherhood including all of the repercussions and payments that could be associated with such.  I understand that the state assumes the right of the child &gt; the right of the parent, however I believe strongly that the father has the right to continue to live his life without sinking payments into a child which was optionally chosen. If a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life.  Or on the opposite, if a mother is given the option to keep a child, willingly knowing the father does not want to, then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself, as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child. Obviously this excludes rape and all other implications, this is only within consensual sex.  TL;DR: Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood, and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for, in a consensual Pro-Choice environment.  EDIT: Slight confusion/comments regarding abortion, I believe that it is solely the woman's responsibility as to whether she should abort or not, it is her ""pro choice"", however fathers have the right to ""opt out"" of fatherhood, or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it. EDIT2: This is going pretty well, some good discussions. As suggested another way to put this would be 'Committing to sex is not committing to parenthood"".  TheScamr worded this nicely: &gt;Right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother, either financially, custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption. Pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood. OP is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition : consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood, either financially, custodially or emotionally.  EDIT3: This has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion, so thank you CMV. It's a controversial topic because while Men should have the same rights as Women, the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father, but not the mother. I think /u/Billy90 put forward the best argument against this.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Child support is not an issue of whether or not you are going to have a child, but who should supports a living child. If parents do not want to raise a child, tough shit its not like they have the option not too (unless they both agreed to adoption). So in terms of child support after the child is born it is already on equal grounds, women have to pay child support for children that are in the fathers custody. Child support is not an issue before the child is born so lets get to what you are really asking for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Women have the right to abort a pregnancy, men do not. This has nothing to do with child support, and your ideas of fairness only lead to a man being able to force a abortion (Obviously something no one is in favor of as you have mentioned). The choice to have a child is not the same choice as supporting the child.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So in your example you are really asking for the ability to trade the responsibility of raising a child, with the right to have a abortion. In what other legal context do we make such concessions? It really doesn&amp;#39;t follow to make such a trade for fairness or equality. In this case you are really asking for a substitute right for one that can not be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The contradiction I see in your argument is that you want a privilege for men because women have a right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all children were raised collectively by society, I&amp;#39;d be in 100% agreement. But as it is, we&amp;#39;re stuck in a tricky position- you can&amp;#39;t demand a parent get an abortion for both ethical and practical reasons. But once a baby is born, you can&amp;#39;t exactly euthanize unwanted babies. So who takes care of it? Well, to be fair, the people financially responsible for raising a baby have to be the ones who were responsible for making it. If one parent wants the baby and the other doesn&amp;#39;t, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s unfair to require the other parent&amp;#39;s financial support. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The equivalent position for a man is not pregnancy vs. child support. It&amp;#39;s just child support vs. child support. If a mother abandons the baby and the father wants to raise it, I would say the mother is equally on the hook in this case and should pay child support. The issue is we don&amp;#39;t see this very often, and because of how much our culture emphasizes women as child-raisers as opposed to fathers, I&amp;#39;m willing to bet it hasn&amp;#39;t occurred to most people this is a thing. Importantly, though, this doesn&amp;#39;t have much to do with abortion- once the child is born, both parents have a duty. Before a child is born, this is an issue either about ending a life or bodily integrity, and in neither case does the father have much of a say.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: The counterpart to absent fathers is absent mothers, who should also have to pay child support. We just don&amp;#39;t see it happen that often. This has nothing to do with abortion. It has to do with the rights of the child.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: I'm not worried about the US government spying on citizens.,"Please note before reading: Please do not downvote my comments and replies on basis of disagreement. I've done several CMV's where I was the clear minority in terms of viewpoint, and got downvoted on nearly every post. Due to Reddit's karma system, this makes me wait a period of 7 minutes in between replies if my karma is low, and makes it more difficult for me to respond to everyone (the more karma you have, the less time you need to wait to post). If I act like a dick to you, act irrational, or say something logically fallacious, I implore you to downvote me, but I'd really like to be able to discuss with everybody and not be held back by my inability to reply (and consequently hear replies).  Okay, onto my view. I'm not worried about the US government spying on citizens, for the following reasons.  1. I don't necessarily ""have nothing to hide"", but I don't expect that there is literally a person on a computer looking through what I post to Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook (or what porn I look at). I have some personal things I wouldn't want an actual person to know or look through, but I feel entirely comfortable with a machine using a CTRL-F function to search for terrorist activity, or other organized illegal activities since I don't commit any major crime. I know a lot of people are worried about the government seeing people torrenting things illegally or watching movies/shows illegally on the internet, but considering how widely this is done and how nonexistent people are prosecuted for it based on the governments ability to view all this, I'm not worried about it. I don't do drugs, but if I did and tried to buy drugs over FB or text, I doubt the government would even care. We have /r/trees for instance, thousands of people openly doing minor illegal things and the government doesn't care enough to try and arrest them.  2. I remember hearing during Rand Paul's filibuster that there has been terrorist activity stopped by government spying on people. I think government spying still has an effect as a deterrent (terrorists can't use media to communicate, and therefore it makes terrorist activity harder to commit. I also heard during the filibuster that the government was using spying to take down organized crime. I'm not worried about that, considering I'm not involved in organized crime and therefore am not worried about it. (I'd like to point out here, that it's not really a view regarding sympathy or empathy towards criminals and what rights they should have to privacy, but simply my *feeling of worry* about being spied on). I don't view the NSA spying on druglords to be much different than wire taps or undercover officers.  3. In addition to the above, I have the view that Islamic extremism is, as of ISIS' international attacks (or extremist Muslims inspired by ISIS at least), a legitimate threat to the United States. There have been US citizens that have gone to fight for ISIS and local Islamic extremist attacks, and believe the US should be able to spy on their communications. They have claimed to have thousands of people in the US, and while that may be an exaggeration, I don't believe it to be unbelievable considering they have had 150 individuals that have travelled to Syria to fight for ISIS (Source: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/25/american-foreign-fighters-isis_n_6753854.html). I would expect if many people are willing to take the trouble to travel to another country to fight others, it's not unexpected that they more would stay in the US to try and perform terrorist activity here considering it would be easier.  4. I'm not worried about the government knowing my political views. I broadcast them publicly on Facebook, and considering our country's devotion to free speech as well as multiple political parties, I don't view any dissent to be any threat to my well-being. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There is a culture of finding and trading nude pictures at the NSA. It has been suspected that the NSA has shared data with other agencies (like police forces and the DEA).

They will know about the fact he messed around with a guy when he was 19 and the fact that he had a crisis of faith in which he &amp;quot;cursed god&amp;quot; in a private email that he deleted before sending at 22.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Allowing spying on this scale with little to no filter means granting domestic spy agencies even more severe power to tip the balance of political power in their favor, entrenching them even deeper.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Case and point: The FBI revealed Martin Luther King&amp;#39;s infidelity to his wife.

But why is he referred to as the first *man* in space? To me, calling Valentina Tereshkova the First *Woman* in space simply emphasizes her difference -- she's female -- instead of her accomplishment.  If we're all supposed to treat everyone equally regardless of race, nationality, gender, orientation, religious views, etc; wouldn't referring someone as the first *whatever* to do something simply remind everyone that the difference is still there, and make it that much more difficult to ignore in the future?  EDIT: My V has been C'd! I see that the social impact of the accomplishment is equally important, and we need to recognize what these people had to go through in order to actually get there! I do think, though, that these types of titles will slowly become irrelevant for future accomplishments, and eventually will be relegated only to the history books.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If we all pretended that he was just some other MLB player then he would be forgotten and we would forget how influential he was to equality. He was different, the entire concept of whites playing baseball with blacks was different, and because of that he serves as a reminder that we should all have equal rights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: trying a child as an adult makes the protections offered to children irrelevant and is downright vengeful,"This is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are!  Juveniles are given special treatments in trials, there is a focus on rehabilitation an integration back into society. This makes a lot of sense to me, children are still learning and don't have much freedom in life. Many of their choices and actions are an immediate cause of their situation, and removing them from that could potentially help. Not to mention, the focus on punishment in adult courts can likely lead to training a kid to be an offender for life,  Trying a kid as an adult circumvents all of that, and ignores the fact that society expects persons under 18 years of age to need additional supervision and warrant more rehabilitation in the case of crimes. It seems so juvenile that someone who commits a worse crime (and is more in need of rehab) would magically be considered an adult just because of severity. Do actions make someone an adult, or age and experience?  EDIT: I think it is also important to consider there is a growing amount of evidence that states adolescence continues up until 25[1].  Also, many cases that have children tried as adults aren't emancipated minors, it's typically just due to severity. I would consider an emancipated minor tried as an adult more logical, but possibly more morally wrong for a society to do. Emancipation isn't generally a happy thing, and often due to poor circumstances... more rehabilitation would likely make sense, but I see how it would be logical for a system.

They will get a jury trial, and it will be open to the media and the public. But in juvenile court there is no jury and often the media and the public are banned from attending the trial.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A good example is the case of Jordan Brown, he was convicted as a juvenile of a crime which he most likely did not commit.

"CMV: I can't wrap my head around why individuals who earn more money should be forced to pay tens of thousands more in taxes, when they utilize the services as often as anyone else.","I believe that people have a **moral obligation** to donate money they do not need. Full stop.  But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of moralizing. The government is established to protect inalienable rights and to allow for fair competition. There are many cases where the government is not doing its job in allowing for fair competition, but I am not speaking about these cases. I'm going to give a few scenarios, and I'd love if someone who disagrees could criticize the conclusions I make.  - There are two pizza delivery companies. One of the company owners, Pablo, spent every night for the past 6 months figuring out how to optimize his business. He found better ways to incubate pizzas, better ways to stack pizzas in his pizza-mobile, and also found better ways to pizza his pizza. Because of this, more people are buying his pizzas. In the next year, Pablo earned three times as much as his competitor. Pablo sends his kids to public school, and has the same amount of kids as his competitor; he goes to the doctor when he is ill, and goes the same amount of times as his competitor; he's an American just like his competitor, and benefits from military defense in the same way; *why on Earth would Pablo have to spend multiple times as much money on these things than his competitor?* I really don't get it, I'm sorry. They utilize the same services in the same exact way, why is Pablo in essence *subsidizing* his competitor's payments just because Pablo is a smarter, more efficient businessman?  - There's a marathon going on in Vermont. Two hundred participants compete for the $1,000 given to first, second, and third place. Each participant puts down $20, which goes toward prize money and ensuring the event is run well. Each winner splits the prize money. At the end of the race, the three winners of first, second, and third place are shocked to find out that they are only taking home $120. The event organizers apparently decided that the winners, despite working harder and simply being better at their craft, and despite equally paying for the organization of the event, should have to pay the other participants for simply existing.  I just don't get it. If I drive to work and pass a bridge, I need to pay the toll because bridges cost money. Great. And perhaps I should pay in proportion to how much I drive, that seems like a good idea as well. But if I make a successful website that utilizes none of the services, and in fact very few services at all, is it not plainly *theft* that a bureaucrat decides where my EARNED money goes? I'd rather donate the money I don't need to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, to environmental causes, to the cure for cancer, but the government seems to be stealing it from me so they can play live-action Battlefield 5: Real Life Edition.

The government is not in the business of moralizing but it is in the business of survival.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lets take Uber&amp;#39;s request for the first 500K self driving Google cars as an example.  Here we have a company run by &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; few people.  With this acquisition alone, it will remove 500K jobs from the job market.  Those people will go on unemployment while they &lt;em&gt;attempt&lt;/em&gt; to look for more work.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On the flip side, all of the people working at Uber will make more money and will pay &lt;em&gt;a little&lt;/em&gt; more in taxes.  But only incrementally so.  Without a progressive tax system, the amount of money generated by the additional tax is not nearly enough to offset the loss from unemployment alone.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That is one example within an entire generation of change.  We&amp;#39;re seeing a shift in wealth faster than ever before and without progressive taxation, there just won&amp;#39;t be enough money to run the country.  It&amp;#39;s not about morality or fairness.  It has nothing to do with anything the politicians say to pander to one side or the other.

It&amp;#39;s just that McDonalds workers never get hit the higher brackets, so their average tax rate is lower as a result.  But make no mistake that both people are taxed equally and fairly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for your other point about only paying taxes for services you consume, I think you&amp;#39;re completely missing the point of government.  Instead of a pizza place where you pay for the pizza you eat, you should think of government more like an insurance company where money is pooled.  &lt;strong&gt;Insurance would be pointless if you only paid for damage to your property.&lt;/strong&gt;  Similarly government is pointless if everyone is just covering their individual costs or needs case by case.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Like it or not, we live in a society.

CMV: Jack of All Trades and a Master of None is Better than a Master of One,"We've all heard the saying that a Jack of All Trades is a Master of None.  I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you are good at many things you will never be a ""master"" at some skill or aspect of your life.    What I am willing to argue is that benefits of being a Jack of All Trades far outweighs the benefits of being a master of one or few ""trades"".  For starters, the possibility of finding the thing that truly makes you happy and satisfied in life is lessened quite significantly if your endeavors are honed into a certain subject at an early age.  The amount of time you spend on a certain skill, hobby, or whatever it may be is inversely related on the amount of time you spend on other aspects of your life.  It is my opinion that when you decide on your calling and devote yourself almost entirely to it, you miss out on other precious and interesting opportunities that your life could include otherwise.    There is no doubt in my mind that abundant success in life is generated by the willingness to make a sacrifices for the thing that you believe that you want the most.  It is up to the individual to decide what matters to them the most.  Personally though, I think this is such a misguided approach to life that often leaves people feeling unfulfilled when they approach an advanced age.  Is ""success"" in life really that valuable to humans that they are willing to give up so much of their time to a specific task?  The need to be recognized and respected as a master of a particular aspect of life is a major driving factor of the sacrifices people make.     A Jack of All Trades in my opinion does not mean you have to be great or even good at the things that you try once, or even do on a regular basis.  For sanity's sake though, let's just say a Jack of All Trades is ""good"" at many things and a Master is ""great"" at one thing.  When you set your focus on being great at one aspect of your life, there is the potential to backseat so many other important things in your life.  I think, perhaps, this is best explained with an example.  I have a co-worker who is one of the most vocally well-versed, decorated, and revered employees at the company at which I am employed.  I am still quite young, and I just graduated college and he is one of my mentors.  Working with him has really shown me what true mastery looks like.  However, he spends at least 60+ hours a week at work for no real reason other than the fact that he is potentially obsessed with his work.  At his age, I know for a fact he would rather be spending time with his grand kids; he doesn't view time the same way most others do, and as a result ends up leaving the office at 7 o'clock every night.     I try not to work overtime unless we are really running behind on a project, because while I love my job, I don't feel the need to devote myself fully to the task.  As a result, I am able to focus on so much else and I am not constantly thinking about one specific thing.  The ability to detach myself from my career after I leave the office (or job site) really seems to subconsciously effect the rest of my day.  I feel more energized when I workout and I don't mind studying other things or brushing up on languages other than English.  I also get the opportunity to socialize more with friends when I leave work on time.  Having weekends off means I have the potential to do whatever I want and I can pick up new hobbies along the way.  So in short I am sacrificing the potential to be great at one thing for the potential to be good (or maybe even just experience) many other things.    Please don't relegate this to being a work-a-holic and not being a work-a-holic.  This was purely a life example that directly relates to the topic at hand.  I am sure it is possible to be a Master of one or more things and still be good at a lot of other things, but my main point is that a Jack of All Trades is a much more interesting and fulfilling approach to life than dedication to a singular practice.           **Edit**  Here is the delta, thanks **AnecdotallyExtant**  &gt;I will change your view with a single diagram. It will demonstrate that in order to become a master of one, a person must first become a Jack of all. As an anecdotal example: I am myself somewhere right around the transition between the eighth and ninth picture in that diagram. But I am also the handiest person I know around the house. I can and regularly do fox everything in my house -- nearly worthless with cars, but the home I'm solid. So again, to become a master of a single trade, one must first become a jack of all. Or one cannot understand his or her own trade out of context. This is why we start our educations in kindergarten and not in graduate studies. A wide, solid, strong and synthetic knowledge base is an absolute a priori necessity. Which means that it can only follow that a master of one is superior, because it includes a thorough training in the jack of all.  Please read below if you want to see the diagram.

CMV: there is no legal or moral argument against allowing incestuous marriage that hasn't been thrown away in pursuit of gay marriage.,"To start: **I am *not* saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing.**  However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there's some psychological affliction behind it, but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well, but psychologists realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course, any religious objections are right out.  So with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled, I'm left without any good reason why siblings should marry each other. CMV  Edit 1: Added emphasis.  Edit 2: Stepping away for a bit. I'll be back in a few hours. (8:45pm, GMT)  Edit 3: Deltas awarded to: /u/SquirrelPower for pointing out that there is a legal difference between types of classes. /u/the-friendzoner made a similar argument, that the sexual attraction of incest is different than an orientation.   I don't consider these sufficient reasons to continue the ban, but they are distinct from the reasons given for banning homosexuality, so they fulfill the terms of my post.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

So, in that sense, I understand why you want to dismiss that factor altogether. However, there&amp;#39;s a substantial line between a homosexual couple and an incestuous heterosexual one: the former can have sex or not have sex, but no matter what, their sexual lives will not impact the lives of anyone else; the latter, however, will result in a significantly higher chance of producing a child with a lower quality-of-life. True, marriage does not equal procreation, but by sanctioning that relationship, the government would be supporting a relationship that may negatively impact the lives of their future offspring. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I imagine a common argument to this might be that we allow marriage for individuals who knowingly have a higher genetic chance of passing on an abnormal trait, but we cannot simply disallow marriage entirely for one person. Similarly, it&amp;#39;s wrong to ban marriage of an entire sexual orientation. People have the right to fall in love and get married. However, that is not the same as banning the marriage of an incestuous couple, as those individuals can still fall in love within their desired orientation, outside of the family, and get married in a relationship that will statistically produce healthier children. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This whole situation is comparing apples with camels. Can a person attracted to their sibling be only attract to their sibling? I mean, to really allow this, we&amp;#39;d have to distinguish fetish from sexual orientation. Can they have a relationship with anyone else, if they are of the gender the person is attracted to?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A gay man could potentially marry any other gay man, right? The pool of choice is large and diverse. Whereas, the person who is attracted to their sibling can only marry those one or two people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gay marriage denial was a form of persecution due to sexual orientation, I think incest is more of a lifestyle application, maybe even one that might be impacted by life experiences: not having met any other X and having relationships with those individuals. If it is only due to proximity and lack of exposure, then it&amp;#39;s not really a rights violation. It would also indicate that they didn&amp;#39;t really have a choice in the matter because they were subjected to a limited population with whom to form relationships.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the argument I&amp;#39;ve been using for a long time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: Ellen Pao's leadership will have little to no impact on reddit's ""free speech""","I'm seeing posts everywhere regarding the ""safe space"" that reddit is destined to become under the new CEO's leadership, but have not been able to find any agenda from Pao herself that seems controversial at all: the only thing I've seen her say is that she's concerned about harassment and threats, and I would argue that both of those issues are not only deserving of attention, but not at all shocking. I've also seen people say that subreddits critical of Pao have been removed, but there are always other factors at play in the comments and there are several still going, plus about five front page posts per day about what a horrible person she is, so I don't know if I can call that censorship either. In short, I feel that the predictions about reddit becoming an environment that bans free speech or whatever are wildly overblown. Ignoring her personal life (which, scandal ridden or not is irrelevant to her performance at reddit) can you change my view?  Here I also might need to concede that even if subs devoted to harrassment *were* banned (CoonTown, fatpeoplehate, etc etc ad infinitum), I don't think reddit or the world would be losing anything of value. I'm embarrassed to tell people I come here because of those subs, and I don't think that reddit or any privately held corporation is under obligation to host anything of that nature. So while I don't see them getting removed, I wouldn't she a single tear if they did.

Israelis and Palestinians, people who&amp;#39;ve had abortions, Christians, etc.  I think it&amp;#39;s very possible that certain groups would be &amp;quot;protected&amp;quot; from group harassment but not others.  So for example if someone criticizes MRAs that&amp;#39;s just discussion, but if they criticize feminists that&amp;#39;s targeting women. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s what she thinks, but there are definitely people who would characterize attacks on feminism as &amp;quot;targeting women&amp;quot; (an example that comes to mind is &lt;a href=""http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/libe/dv/11_revframework_statute_/11_revframework_statute_en.pdf""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, the EU&amp;#39;s (proposed but not passed) &amp;quot;Model National Statute for the Promotion of Tolerance&amp;quot;.  It seeks to ban &amp;quot;group libel&amp;quot;, which to me is similar to &amp;quot;group harassment&amp;quot;.  It seeks to target - alongside racism, homophobia, and anti-Semitism - &amp;quot;anti-feminism&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;EDIT: Also:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think that reddit or any privately held corporation is under obligation to host anything of that nature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s true, but reddit is also not obligated to host Republicans, or religious people, or people opposed to more NASA funding.  I don&amp;#39;t think their rights is the issue, it&amp;#39;s the question of having a website that is run pursuant to principles that most people like, like the ideal of free speech.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;People feel ownership for the places they spend enough time in, so even if it&amp;#39;s a privately owned web site, the fact that they opened it up for anyone to join means the effect will take hold.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you do this, if you lay this &amp;quot;trap&amp;quot; unwittingly or otherwise, then things like &lt;a href=""/r/subredditcancer""&gt;/r/subredditcancer&lt;/a&gt; et. al will happen. At the Spock-level of logic, such people would move somewhere else if they don&amp;#39;t like what the site&amp;#39;s owners are doing. Go to &lt;a href=""https://voat.co""&gt;voat.co&lt;/a&gt; and leave us alone. But we&amp;#39;re not Spocks, we&amp;#39;re Kirks. Fuck the Neutral Zone.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the future, I think the operators of forums similar to reddit will recognise the implicit social deal: you like all this traffic and commercial potential? You like having over 100 million pageviews per month? You like being cited in mainstream news articles? Okay, well that comes at a cost beside your servers and bandwith: this place is now &lt;em&gt;ours&lt;/em&gt;. No backsies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been told that the American Civil War was not really about slavery but about the degree of control that the Federal government wanted to put on the states, after a hundred years of minding their own business. The expectation of self-control was already baked in, so even a mind-bogglingly positive policy such as the abolition of slavery was the canary in the coal-mine. The states revolted and it got messy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s happening on reddit is at a microscopic level compared to the Civil War, but many of the same feelings are mixed in. It&amp;#39;s just part of human nature, and that&amp;#39;s why Pao&amp;#39;s actions will be harmful: the implicit contract was broken, no matter how good the intentions for breaking it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Regular season games are boring.,"**tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting?**  I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to sports, I know more and watch more than any of my peers through work, school, or friendship. I like hockey, baseball, and the NFL. But regular season games are boring.  Boring can be good sometimes. A casual baseball game on a lazy afternoon is amazing, and it's great in the background during a family gathering. Seeing a game in person is awesome and regular season games are perfect for that because if you miss a play it's not the end of the world. I find the NFL regular season *almost* engaging because of the short schedule. I understand that in the NHL and MLB you need to play more games so the gap between 1st and last is sufficiently large, so I'm not suggesting shorter schedules. I would just really like someone to make regular season games more exciting for me.  The NHL is my favorite by far, but I can't stand regular season games. Until the very end of the season it just feels like watching practice. There's no excitement. It's like a 10 cent bet. Until the end of the season, very little is on the line. I don't see the appeal.  So can someone explain it to me? When I ask my friends who do watch the regular season they get condescending.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should watch soccer. The games are divided into multiple competitions for different trophies rather than a regular and post season. Its much better as every game in a 38 game Premier League season counts, from beginning to end. This also results in the overall best team winning the league rather than a team only playing well for a certain time of year prevailing. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And if your into the do-or-die style like in playoffs, there are several cup tournaments thst incorporate the same feelings as playoffs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFL schedule is good because it&amp;#39;s so short.  With only 16 games on predictable days, each game has an urgency to it.  It&amp;#39;s not quite playoff level, sure, but the difference of 1-2 games can mean an invitation to the playoffs or not... so the teams do bring their best every single game.  There&amp;#39;s a lot of parity in the league, so you don&amp;#39;t see too many atrocious teams or bad games. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The MLB schedule is good because it&amp;#39;s so long.  The times are predictable and games are cheap &amp;amp; accessible (outside Boston &amp;amp; NY, anyways).  They&amp;#39;re not &lt;em&gt;exciting&lt;/em&gt;, particularly on TV IMO... but they&amp;#39;re fun in person, and nice to have on in the background on a lazy summer day.  There are some crummy teams/games, but MLB is a little more about the experience (drinking outside in a fun atmosphere) than the game itself IMO.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no problem with either of those - they&amp;#39;re great fun.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d have to agree that the NBA &amp;amp; NHL regular seasons kind of suck.  The sport is physical enough and the seasons long enough that there&amp;#39;s injury / fatigue risk, so teams play kind of conservatively and rest star players aggressively.  But with 40 home games (instead of the 80-something of mlb), tickets are still rather pricey for many teams.  The game days/times aren&amp;#39;t predictable, so I find myself missing them.  A crumby NBA team gets &lt;em&gt;killed&lt;/em&gt; on the court, it&amp;#39;s not supremely fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I find myself watching the NBA Christmas day games, going in person a couple times and following my local team (often day after write ups), and then watching better matchups &amp;amp; post season.  I&amp;#39;d love to see the NBA season cut down to 50-60 games and played on consistent days of week.  Can Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday be basketball days please?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: I think having a preference against promiscuous people is as valid as having a height or weight preference nor does it constitute ""slut-shaming"".","I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a ""slut"" the poster gets railed for it. I also don't think it is strictly the language being used. Regardless of the label, not wanting your partner to have been with 5+ people is 100% defensible. If we, as a society, can tell people that being tall is attractive or that being fat is unattractive, we can tell being that sleeping around is unattractive.       Another logically invalid argument is that the person with the preference, must not be promiscuous themselves. I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he's hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner's choice in me, we can like different things. Many physically fit men are ""chubby-chasers"" and man slutty men are virginal chasers.    Edit: To clarify, the use of the words ""slut"" earlier was merely a reflection of the term as it has been used on Reddit. I do not view a persons' worth as tied to their sexual history. I also don't have an moral qualms towards premarital sex or number of sexual partners. That said, my personal level of attraction is affected. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I hope the perspective I can offer on this is different enough from what has already been said to be of value to you. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my take. You state in your OP that preferences such as height and weight are generally accepted in our society. Absolutely true. You say in a comment that smoking is a deal breaker for you, that you would never date a woman who smokes. Fair enough. You also say this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A context that came to mind when writing it is the &lt;a href=""/r/relationship""&gt;/r/relationship&lt;/a&gt;[1] posts where the partner learns after-the-fact that his girlfriend/wife (or her husband/boyfriend) had more partners than originally assumed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To me, the difference is that physical appearance and smoking affect you in the present. I could see deciding not to date someone because they have a reputation for promiscuity or because you correlate a higher number of sexual partners with an increased proclivity to cheat or an inability to maintain a healthy relationship. I&amp;#39;m not saying these correlations are correct, but I could understand your hesitation. However, in the scenarios you described, your wife or girlfriend is presumably a woman with whom you have built a solid trust, who has proven herself to be faithful and capable of being a partner. I can understand being upset if she lied to you about the number in the past, but even in this case, empathy suggests that she was probably embarrassed or fearful of judgment/rejection. In your scenario, breaking up with the girl for the number of sexual partners she has had is more accurately comparable with breaking up with her because she used to be fat or because she is an ex-smoker. A person can&amp;#39;t change that they used to be fat or that they used to smoke or unsleep with past sexual partners, but they can lose weight and quit smoking and build a healthy monogamous relationship.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I also have qualms with this argument:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another logically invalid argument is that the person with the preference, must not be promiscuous themselves. I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he&amp;#39;s hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner&amp;#39;s choice in me, we can like different things. Many physically fit men are &amp;quot;chubby-chasers&amp;quot; and man slutty men are virginal chasers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What if instead of your example of physically fit men who are chubby-chasers, we are talking about obese women who only want to date men with six-pack abs? Or obese men who only want to date models? Yes, they are still entitled to have that preference, but most of us won&amp;#39;t be surprised or particularly sympathetic when they don&amp;#39;t find a partner. It is hypocritical because they want a partner who takes care of their body, but are not willing to put in the effort themselves. In the same respect, it is hypocritical for you to want a partner who has maintained her chastity, while not be willing to put forth the same effort. Women have a desire for sex too, and I think it is reasonable in this scenario to compare resisting the temptation to have sex with resisting the temptation to eat junk food or watch TV/play video games instead of going to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have one more angle to approach this from. With emerging adulthood and people getting married later, 5+ sexual partners is not necessarily promiscuous. Expecting a woman to be a virgin or have a very low number of previous sexual partners was much more reasonable when people were getting married in their late teens or early twenties. Now, with the average age of marriage closer to 30, many people will have had other significant relationships before they meet the person they marry. We have a longer period of time to work on and learn about ourselves before we settle down, and for many people this includes dating and sexual exploration. Personally, I&amp;#39;m averaging less than one new sexual partner per year since I started having sex, but my number is higher than 5. Yeah, if I got to go back as the person I am today, I would make some different decisions. But I&amp;#39;ve learned from them and I have no regrets. And I feel you dude, I don&amp;#39;t like to think about the women my partner has been with either. But they brought him to me. In the end, unless they contracted an incurable STD or you believe sex is morally wrong, the people our partners slept with before they met us don&amp;#39;t really matter. What matters is the person we are with now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think what you have identified is simply that there are socially sanctioned relationship preferences, and socially unsanctioned preferences, depending on context.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For instance, a man can have an internal, silent preference for lean women, but depending on the context, if he vocalizes it, he is likely to receive criticism.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Women who have a preference for tall men tend to face less open criticism for that preference, even when voiced openly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Both genders tend to not be criticized for openly wanting an intelligent and/or successful partner, in the same way that both genders are essentially never criticized for not wanting a dumb loser.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These socially accepted preferences change over time, and what you are identifying is a universally condemned attribute transitioning out of that realm. For most of history, sexual promiscuity in women has been universally condemnable, and so it&amp;#39;s not unexpected to have a large portion of people who still ascribe to that social custom. As customs go, there is no &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; viewpoint. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As western society has grown more progressive, this particularly female heavy bias against promiscuity has begun to equalize, and we are simply in the tumultuous transition period. There are plenty of people who say it makes zero difference in their choice, and plenty of people who only consider someone who is a virgin. Both are merely choices.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As far as your view goes, I don&amp;#39;t necessarily disagree with your position, but I disagree with your oversimplification. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Slut is a subjective term. Ask 10 people what it means and the only common thread will be sexual promiscuity. There will be a wide range of pejorative attitudes about the term, but the problem lies in the fact that it is exclusively an insult that gets wrongly applied to people with multiple sexual partners.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Consider a young woman, who is 32, and has had only serious boyfriends her whole life. She started dating at 16, lost her virginity to her first boyfriend, and has had a sexual relationship with each of her boyfriends, with a consistent duration of approximately 18-24 months per bf. This gives her a sexual partner range of 8-11 (rounding up). Now, to many people, the number 11 could seem like a high &amp;quot;slutty&amp;quot; number, when in reality she has merely had a long string of moderately long, monogamous relationships, that even allow for something as conservative as a 6-month waiting period before sex.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Consider another person, who had one serious relationship at 16, lost their virginity, broke up when she went to college, and then drunkenly slept with 5 guys in her first year. The next year she met her college sweetheart, and they stayed together for 12 years before breaking up. She is now roughly as old as the first woman, yet has only 7 partners. However, the means at which she got to her 7 as opposed the the other woman&amp;#39;s 11 is monumentally different.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So while it doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean nothing, it is a worthless metric without context. As both those women have had very different sexual pasts, and if you were taking either one of them on a date at 32, their respective pasts would mean very different things to you. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, to bring it back to the word slut, you can see how using that word to describe either of them would mean &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; different things. One of them had a very slow accumulation of partners through 1.5-2 year relationships, and the other had the vast majority of all her partners during one short burst in college, with the previous decade+ being solely monogamous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"CMV: Liberalism is currently undergoing a schism, and is splitting into two factions","From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other.  The first faction is heavily focused on political correctness and the “social justice” movement. They are major proponents of multiculturalism. They tend to view human social behavior as being socially constructed, and the result of the environment, and are often hostile towards evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of outcome than equality of opportunity. Mainstream feminists fall into this category. They are also more likely to support gun control than the second faction. They have more female members compared to the second faction, and are more likely to be religious. Examples of liberals in this faction include: Hillary Clinton, Laci Green, Mike Rugnetta, Trace Dominguez, PZ Myers, and Jen McCreight.  The second faction is liberal socially and economically, i.e. on abortion, gay marriage, drug liberalization, health care, etc., but is vehemently against the political correctness that the first faction espouses. They are also more averse to multiculturalism than the first faction. They tend to seek biological explanations for human behavior, and are more accepting of evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of opportunity than equality of outcome. Almost all of the members of this faction are atheists. This faction is much more heavily male dominated than the first faction. They are also more likely to support gun rights compared to members of the first faction. They also tend to be more likely to criticize mainstream democrats, such as Barack Obama. Examples of liberals in this faction include: Richard Dawkins, George Carlin, TJ Kirk, Phil Mason, and Carl Benjamin.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how exactly you can distinguish b/w these two &amp;quot;factions&amp;quot; based on the considerations you&amp;#39;ve provided. In my experience, members of the first faction are also socially and economically liberal on matters of abortion, gay marriage, health care, drug liberalization, and they do support multiculturalism. There&amp;#39;s so much overlap that your theory doesn&amp;#39;t make a whole lot of sense. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It seems to me that you&amp;#39;ve just separated them based primarily on gender, not issues. Is that accurate?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, can you provide proof of Obama&amp;#39;s atheism? I&amp;#39;d love to see it. He has said that he isn&amp;#39;t very religious, but never said that he rejects god. I&amp;#39;ve never heard it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you&amp;#39;re describing young liberals on the internet; I recognize the dichotomy you describe, and I would only object that it oversimplifies, but I&amp;#39;d also say you&amp;#39;re missing out on a huge portion of liberals:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Business liberals, who lean towards classic liberalism but still with leftist tendencies; basically center-left business people. A media example is the Economist.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Radical leftists, who essentially reject capitalism and are deeply concerned with international issues, viewing most western diplomacy as imperialist or neocolonialist. A media example is Al Jazeera English.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Unions and Labor. They draw from a long left-leaning tradition, even though their members are often socially conservative.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The silent majority, who mostly favor liberal policies but would be very confused if you talked to them about how you thought evo psych was a defining schism issue in liberal politics.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#39;d point out that evolutionary psychology doesn&amp;#39;t make normative prescriptions. For instance, we can accept the evo psych explanation for overconsumption of greasy and sugary foods and still acknowledge that a person&amp;#39;s life benefits from a balanced diet. The same applies to any argument from evolutionary psychology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: The United States lost World War II,"I believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters.  I am not disputing the fact that the United States achieved its principal military/political goals (defeat of the Third Reich and the Japanese Empire), and I of course recognize the fact that the US managed to do so with virtually no civilian casualties/ destruction of the homeland, which is especially impressive given the sheer scale of civilian destruction seen in World War II.  What I am arguing is that, having 'won' (as much as it is possible to win) the war, the United States promptly lost its soul, and has ended up in a worse position than Germany or Japan. The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.  I think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on. It's a cycle that only leads to cartoonishly large military budgets and American blood spilled in conflicts where we don't belong. In short, hegemony has not been kind to the United States, and we would be better off if we weren't a world power.  Contrast this with the Japanese and Germans, who are (arguably) doing rather well for themselves. Sure, each country was broken and defeated at the end of the war, and it took a very long time for them to recover, but they came out better. I say they came out better because neither the Japanese nor Germany have the 'obligation' to police the world. In fact, both countries forbid themselves from taking offensive military action. While these countries can be (and often are) considered 'western', and are sometimes the target of anti-western hate, they are not widely hated like the United States, and are not tasked with maintaining ridiculous global military presence. Rather (and forgive me for oversimplifying), Germany can focus on Germany and Japan can focus on Japan. One need not look long to find a wealth of statistics to indicate that these two nations have far superior social safety nets, education, healthcare, etc. than the United States. While this superiority can, of course, be attributed to a wide variety of factors, I believe that one cannot ignore the important fact that these nations have their priorities straight, having suffered the shame of defeat, having gone through the experience of rebuilding and being free of any expectation of global military prowess.  What really solidifies this belief for me is the existence of universal health care in most of western Europe. I apologize that I don't have the source, but if I remember correctly, I remember watching an interview with a worker in the UK's NHS, who attributed the success of socialized medicine in Europe (versus the US) to the fact that Europe had to rebuild after World War II. Effectively, when you have to start from scratch and pick your life up from the rubble, there's a greater sense of common bond with the rest of your nation. The US, having not been hurt in the war in the same way, never had to rebuild and instead developed a more violently individualistic character, where the idea of potentially paying for someone else's health care is utterly repulsive. Americans, by virtue of having won World War II without civilian casualty, has ended up with a far worse society than those who 'lost'. If that's the case, aren't we the real losers?

However, to apply your reasoning even further back, it&amp;#39;s like saying that Germany actually won World War I because the conclusion of World War I led to the Treaty of Versailles, which through a long change of events, led to Nazi Germany, which started World War II, which, following the reasoning of your OP, ultimately led to Germany coming out ahead of the US in 2015. Perhaps you can reconcile the US achieving its principal military/political goals and Germany/Japan coming out ahead of the US in 2015 by calling it a Pyrrhic victory. But it would still be that, a victory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say you&amp;#39;re taking a very superficial view of the cold war. In many ways this was a mutually beneficial system, where the US &amp;amp; USSR divided up the world (2/3 vs. 1/3) into their own hegemonic spheres of influence. Then for the duration of the cold war, each one was able to use the ostensible &amp;#39;threat&amp;#39; of the other as a propaganda tool to maintain their own local/regional control.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now certainly we can see that over the course of many decades, some people in power were closer in degree to &amp;#39;true believers&amp;#39; who took this geopolitical game too seriously, to the point of real danger. But generally speaking, it&amp;#39;s not really accurate to think that the cold war was considered a bad outcome from the US&amp;#39;s strategic perspective. The perpetual war on terror is the new version of this: a supposedly existential threat that gives a politically expedient excuse for all kinds of measures of control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Our society should be run by the rich. Your voting power should be dependent on the amount of taxes you pay.,"Voting without paying taxes is a conflict of interest. Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run?  I could just vote myself more and more money without bearing any of the expense.  I lost my job last month and I’m on unemployment.  Why should I get a say in how much money I get when I am living off the work of others?  This is just like when you are a child.  You don’t get to make the rules because you aren’t paying the rent, and you don't get to set your allowance.  Money is a medium of exchange it is received when you provide a good or service of value to someone, and spent when you take a good or service of value from someone else.  Therefore the more wealth you accumulate, the more net value you have provided to society.  These people should have more of a say in how our society is run because they have given it the most.    Also this would be for the best since rich people are generally smarter and more competent than poor people, and would choose better politicians that don't just appeal to emotion.   ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite quotes from Rome &amp;quot;... you know nothing of violence.  A pack of mangy dogs can kill a lion.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Democracy is a stable form of government because physical force against it is pointless.  All things being equal the minority would always lose in a fight and so rule by the majority is physically unassailable.  The brilliance of western democracies was constitutional protections to limit the power of even the majority to some reasonable boundaries that all can agree to and thus, even if the majority are in favor of a proposition, the constitutional values will sway popular opinion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My point... It is important that Bill gates doesn&amp;#39;t get more political impact than 100 million other people because, eventually, those 100 million other people would storm his house, kill his guards, and mount his head on a pike.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just look at how well feudal societies worked out in the past, and how well Russia is working out today.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The brilliance of western society is that we are all in this together and we all get to choose the country&amp;#39;s course together.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally... Bill Gates is a great man.  If there was a person alive today who I think could be king and do good it would be Bill Gates.  So I probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be in the mob at his gates...  If however Kim Kardashian were making decisions for millions of others....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taxation is far from the only thing a government does.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In your plutocracy, the 1% could vote to send the other 99% to war, or to become indentured servants, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Besides the question of fairness, obviously, there would be problems with stability.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a big part of the appeal of democracy, and why, when established for some time, democracies are more stable.  If you have a government that the majority finds crappy, there&amp;#39;s a least a mechanism to change it.  (Yes, I know it doesn&amp;#39;t work that well in practice, but it&amp;#39;s still better than most).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"CMV: Political Correctness has not only gotten way out of hand, but it is, ultimately, detrimental to a healthy society.","First, let me clarify by saying I don't support actual, intentional bashing of any kind, however:  We see jokes about it (especially on Reddit) all the time: political correctness is reaching a ludicrous level in our everyday society. It is getting to the point where you can't even make jokes or off-hand remarks without being considered rude, distasteful, ignorant, what ever. I think this is not only not really helpful to a person or group of persons who are facing adversity, it is detrimental. It causes issues that could be making actual progress to falter and nit-pick all of the tiniest little problems they can find rather than strive for real change. It is inadvertently focussing on the negativity in society rather than trying to find a positive solution.   It is my opinion that the only way to get past adversity in life is to toughen up and become immune to it and push your way through it. Real change comes about because of real actions.   This post was inspired by the earlier discussion on the use of the word ""cisgendered"" and wether it is ""normal"" or wether we should then be differentiating the difference between diabetics and nondiabetics and so forth. I don't think this is a helpful debate overall. sure, if you are asking what gender someone is, it is okay, even good, to distinguish, but all I keep seeing around here, and in real life, and at an increasing rate, is how we all need to check our privilege and be more and more sympathetic; how white people can't relate to minority problems, men can't relate to women's suffrage, cisgendered people can't really understand what transgendered people go through.. it just keeps getting more and more specific, and in my opinion, its just focussing everyone's attention on what is wrong with the world, and doesn't actually help us make it better.  Adversity is everywhere, it hits everyone.  I may be a man, but maybe my dad sexually abused me and locked me in the basement my whole childhood. That girl may be white, but maybe she was raised in a seedy part of town with a drug addicted prostitute mother. Maybe that guy is a straight white male from a nice neighborhood, but he was somehow infected with HIV and now he has AIDS. My point is, none of those people are going to get through their hardships by focussing on those things they can't change, doing so would only hinder their own growth. I can't help but think the same thing when I hear about someone getting upset about someone else using language they find to be offensive. Again, I'm not saying bullying is okay, but the line between what is considered okay to joke about, and what is borderline a hate crime seems to be getting thinner and thinner. In my eyes, trying to further political correctness is only babying everyone and hindering actual growth.  TL;DR There is no relative degree of suffering, everyone has a hard life, and trying to force everyone to walk on eggshells all the time doesn't help anyone make their life better.  I hope you don't think i'm terrible for thinking this way, and I would love to hear everyone's input.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Racism, sexism, and other types of discrimination distill people down to one trait – race, gender, etc. Reducing the negative language surrounding the dehumanization of these groups of people does indeed make life better for the people in that minority group.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a thought experiment called the &lt;a href=""http://blog.ian.gent/2013/10/the-petrie-multiplier-why-attack-on.html""&gt;Petrie Multiplier&lt;/a&gt;, originally used to demonstrate the effect that sexism has on the female vs male experience in the tech industry:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say that we have 20% women and 80% men in Tech.  And that 20% of people make inappropriate remarks or other sexist moves towards people of the opposite gender.  So 20% of men make sexist remarks to women, and 20% of women make sexist remarks to men.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with 50 people.  [...]  Given the 20% ratios, we have 40 men and 10 women, and 8 of the 40 men sometimes make sexist remarks towards women, while 2 of the 10 women make sexist remarks to men. I can&amp;#39;t emphasise enough that there is no difference in sexism between the genders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see what happens when we have had 70 sexist remarks made.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The luckiest man receives zero sexist remarks.  But in fact he doesn&amp;#39;t need to be very lucky, because most men receive no remarks.  There is an unlucky guy [...] who receives three sexist remarks, [...] But that&amp;#39;s the unluckiest guy out of 40.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The luckiest woman receives four sexist remarks.  So let&amp;#39;s get this straight: the luckiest woman out of 10 experiences worse sexism than the unluckiest man out of 40. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course it gets worse. The unluckiest woman experiences nine incidents.  On average? The mean number of sexist remarks per man is 0.35, while for women it is 5.6.  There&amp;#39;s a gender disparity of 4:1 but the disparity in experience is 16:1.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Men are no more sexist than women in this thought experiment, but women&amp;#39;s experience is sixteen times worse than the men&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The maths that explains this is simple. With 20% women the gender ratio is 1:4.  So there are 4 times as many men to make sexist remarks, so 4 times as many sexist remarks are made to women as to men. But there are 4 times fewer women to receive sexist remarks, so each individual woman is four times as likely to receive a given remark than an individual man is.  These effects multiply, so in this example the mean number of sexist remarks per woman is 16 times the number per man.  This holds in general, so with a gender ratio of 1:r, women will receive r2 times as many sexist remarks as men.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That is the Petrie Multiplier. An argument that an attack on sexism in Tech is NOT an attack on men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We can see that, in terms of suffering of sexist remarks, women in this situation suffer more. Sure, the men in the thought experiment probably suffer in other aspects of their life, but it doesn&amp;#39;t impact the fact that reducing sexist remarks overall will lead to a significant impact in the reduction of suffering in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We can apply the same reasoning to any other minority group on the receiving end of hurtful remarks. Being politically correct is not an attack on the people making the jokes or the off-hand remarks – instead, it&amp;#39;s a move to reduce the suffering of those affected by the remarks. And even when you entertain the idea that there&amp;#39;s no relative degree of suffering, which I interpret as &amp;quot;everyone suffers equally&amp;quot; in some weird universal karmic balance system, it would mean that everyone suffers from some type of hurtful off-hand remark. In that case, reducing those remarks would reduce suffering for everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think political correctness is a bit out of hand, I&amp;#39;m a minority (disabled) so I&amp;#39;ll relate some of the points I favour and don&amp;#39;t in relation to what you say; (I&amp;#39;m profoundly deaf btw).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Firstly, there are some things that absolutely shouldn&amp;#39;t be said, they&amp;#39;re outdated terms that are particularly offensive. For example, they used to go around calling deaf people (or deaf-mutes) &amp;#39;deaf and dumb&amp;#39;, say that to me or any other deaf person and you&amp;#39;re liable to provoke a very aggressive respond.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, I notice a lot of politically correct &amp;#39;terms&amp;#39; are championed, somewhat ironically, by the &amp;#39;majority&amp;#39; who simply don&amp;#39;t understand the impact of what that term has. For example, deaf people have their own culture, mostly due to the communication barrier, they identify as &amp;#39;deaf&amp;#39;, they don&amp;#39;t identify as the hearing like to put it as &amp;#39;hearing impaired&amp;#39;. In fact, that term pisses me and plenty of others in the community off, we&amp;#39;re not &amp;#39;impaired&amp;#39;, we&amp;#39;re deaf, end off.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem is though, is those who do champion a cause tend to be very blind to the wider picture, instead focusing on narrow goals, perhaps supported by evidence that supports their views and not necessarily evidence of the views of the full community.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#39;m trying to say is, there has to be a balance between avoiding terms that are out and out offensive for a particular group, to going so far the other way you&amp;#39;re not really representing them anymore. A lot of political correctness has gone too far in one direction, on top of that, the movement for &amp;#39;equality&amp;#39; often focuses on singular aspects, so say female rights, or ethnic representation, but only ever skim the surface of the issue; See, token black guy representation in movies and whatnot, it is skin deep, satisfies some equality tick but doesn&amp;#39;t really represent a particular culture or group or individual from a group. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why I shake my head a lot at politically inspired (or otherwise) equality activism, because a lot of the times it isn&amp;#39;t all-encompassing, people jostle for gender-equality, sexuality-equality and whatnot but ignore things like disability-equality, and then you get things just making the minority net &amp;#39;wider&amp;#39; by adding things like diabetes as an equality &amp;#39;right&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Basically, I think people need to stop for a minute and do things the &amp;#39;deaf&amp;#39; way in some respects; That is, celebrate our differences, there&amp;#39;s not always a need to be the same, there&amp;#39;s not always a need to &amp;#39;check your privilege&amp;#39;. Those who buy-in to differences, accept them and celebrate them while being inclusive are the ideal people, but they&amp;#39;re a rarity as a lot of issues just drop into a slanging match.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An example; A co-worker of mine was always inclusive towards deaf people, but we thought we&amp;#39;d show him what the reality was, we took him to a deaf club (no speech, sign language only) and he said it was eye-opening how difficult it was for him to access the community, because essentially it was role reversal. He took up learning the language to get involved, and the deaf group tried their best via writing/talking in the mean time. Obviously we can&amp;#39;t do that for things like gender or sexuality in the same way, but I do think there are methods to get involved that will open up eyes to certain aspects that would promote camaraderie and friendlieness without political correctness interfering; god knows the PC brigade would have had a field day if they caught one black guy who used to do the &amp;#39;smile and you can see me&amp;#39; joke at work, especially if any white person mentioned it outside of work, that&amp;#39;s wrong imo, because it&amp;#39;s all done in the spirit of people bonding and having fun and recognising that yeah, we&amp;#39;re different, is that such a bad thing?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NB: Just in case; I don&amp;#39;t condone racism, sexism or any kind of discrimination, it exists, sure, and it&amp;#39;s fucking hurtful when it happens - I should know, but inclusiveness is the answer not PC or the latest fad &amp;#39;trend&amp;#39; from social campaigners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: NYC sucks,"I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have lived/currently live there, I could not be more dead set against ever moving there. In fact, I have come to despise that place. As a quick note about the perspective I have: I'm a 3rd-year law student. I grew up in South FL, and currently live in Boston, MA. I'm not a stranger to life in a northeastern American city; maybe city life in general is not for me, although I do like Boston *much* better than New York.   First, it's filthy. There is trash *everywhere*, the water is polluted, and the air simply does not smell clean. Being an old Northeastern city, it's filled with old buildings, many of which are in varying degrees of disrepair. It's just generally a dirty, sad place for me to be.   It's also crowded. NYC has ~8.5 million people crammed into around 300 square miles. To walk anywhere, you must wade through a sea of drab, disheveled humanity. The public transit is packed. Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I've ever had.     The cost of living is exorbitant, as everyone already knows. Rent alone takes up most of my friends' paychecks, and their places aren't even that nice or spacious. New Yorkers seem like they pay through the nose for a standard of living that ain't that great.  Then there's the climate. The winters are frigid and soul-crushing, complete with biting wind and extended periods of low sunlight or darkness. The summers are sweltering, and the heat only exacerbates the ever-present smell of rotting garbage. Plus, central air is apparently only for the wealthy northeasterners, because it is conspicuously scarce in most homes/apartments I've visited.   I can't understand the allure of that city. The wealthy live comfortable lives while most everyone else pays through the nose to live wretchedly. People get an inexplicable sense of self-importance and accomplishment simply by moving there and living there for a bit, regardless of what they're doing. Maybe I'd feel accomplished too, if I paid $800/month to live in a cardboard box and resisted the temptation to commit suicide by antagonizing the psychotic, fascist police to which NYC is a home.   TL;DR NYC is a crowded, dirty, dismal place and I cannot ever picture myself being happy there. CMV.    Edit: I'm well aware of the shitty aspects of Boston life; to me, NYC's bads are more...well, *bad* than Boston's, that's my point. Also, inb4 ""hurr Florida has bad things about it too."" I definitely know that's true!  Edit 2: FOLKS, this post isn't about ""Boston &gt; NYC""; I'm well aware that there are bad parts about Boston too. Pointing out bad shit about other cities doesn't help make the case for NY.   Edit 3: For everyone who keeps bitching at me about the delta I gave to u/whattodo-whattodo - READ THE FUCKING RULES. Quoting rule 4's explanation of delta: ""Please note that a delta is not a sign of 'defeat', *it is just a token of appreciation towards a user who helped tweak or reshape your opinion*. A delta =/= end of discussion"" (emphasis added). I've gotten so many replies to the effect of ""hurr, you're a law student and you gave up dat easy?""

Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I&amp;#39;ve ever had.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll admit, NYC can feel a bit crowded when you&amp;#39;re on a packed train trying to commute to work, but otherwise, I&amp;#39;ve not experienced having to wade through crowds of people on a regular basis. And if I do, I wouldn&amp;#39;t call the typical New York resident a member of &amp;quot;drab, disheveled humanity&amp;quot;. In fact, some of us are quite good-looking and take pride in our hygiene. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cost of living is exorbitant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Salaries are adjusted to the cost of living, to some small degree. But you&amp;#39;re probably still thinking of Manhattan (and some trendy parts of Brooklyn). When you go out into the outer boroughs, rent can easily go down to 700/600/500 per month, which isn&amp;#39;t terrible. When you weigh the cost of living in a small space to the availability of basically everything (i.e. food, nightlife, cultural institutions, people, schools, etc.), then I would say lots of people would give up a front yard to live in a place of diversity and activity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winters are frigid and soul-crushing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is undeniably true. &lt;a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/14/422939198/the-last-boston-snow-farm-finally-melts""&gt;But hey, at least we&amp;#39;re not Boston, whose largest snow pile just melted yesterday.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn resident here. Moved in a few months ago from a small CT town and would like to provide my input as I have fallen in love with my City and Neighborhood. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your first point, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s filthy and old and in disrepair.&amp;quot;  Since you don&amp;#39;t live here you may not understand that many of the buildings that look like they&amp;#39;re in disrepair are actually some of the most hip and interesting places. For example, My office building is an old Brass Factory in Williamsburg Brooklyn and from the outside it kinda looks abandoned, but walk in and you&amp;#39;ll see that it has a very aesthetically pleasing interior. Don&amp;#39;t judge a book by its cover. On top of that, yes NYC is an old city, therefor it has a rich history resulting in an overwhelming appreciation and desire for vintage styles/fashion/lifestyles/art/etc.. That&amp;#39;s why I believe Brooklyn and other parts of NYC have been deemed a Hipster hub. Old, doesn&amp;#39;t always mean bad. For the trash, yes, there are parts that are more dirty than others, but much of the city is really clean too. I think your experience with the trash might be a bit narrow minded.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s crowded. Yes, yes it is and thats a beautiful thing. I always get an appreciating for the human race when I&amp;#39;m walking through a sea of people because it&amp;#39;s an achievement to be able to sustain so many people in such a small area. Also, those Disheveled/drab people are also some of the smartest and most innovative people in the nation.  On top of that NYC is probably one of the most diverse and ethnically accepting cities in the world. With all these people comes exposure to new cultures, rituals, food, outlooks on life, etc. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cost of living is high and salaries reflect that. The average salary for a particular job in NYC is higher than other places. Rent is so expensive, but you&amp;#39;re not paying so much to sleep in a small apartment but rather paying to be so close to all the action. There is so much to experience that if you&amp;#39;re staying in Mon-Fri, you&amp;#39;re not doing NYC right. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Climate. Boston just had record snow falls and a much harsher winter than us. The heat, just comes with the north east. In the summer, it&amp;#39;s always humid and hot. That&amp;#39;s not just for NYC, thats everywhere. The smell of garbage can be a problem and it&amp;#39;s most prevalent in the subway systems, where it can get uncomfortably hot, but this is mostly in the touristy areas of the city where non-residents think it&amp;#39;s ok to liter. I&amp;#39;ve seen tourists litter waaaaayyyyy more often than residents who have an appreciation for their city. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It seems like you&amp;#39;re mostly describing parts of Manhattan. I invite you to come to my Neighborhood in Brooklyn.

CMV: Touch-Typing should be a required skill for university.,"I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at the keys and often hunting and pecking. I personally consider this a major problem because I think it is holding us back to some extent.  Some points that I use to support this argument:  1. Faster typing = more productivity, businesses would benefit. You could do more paperwork, more homework, anything on the computer. I'd argue that if everybody could type, we'd all have more free time as well, or at the very least GDP would increase as we get more work done in less time.   2. It's useful for personal and professional activities: Even if all you do is type posts on facebook and write an email to your grandkids, knowing how to type will help you.  3. It's easy to learn. It's all muscle memory, and if you practiced for an hour a day you'd be good in a month. Plus there are programs galore for it.   So, my view is that if university required you to know how to touch-type, perhaps with a modest WPM test on entry, or at least a freshman-year course, people would be forced to learn it and would become better typists, thus benefiting everyone down the line.   Why university? Because minimum wage workers don't usually need to type on a computer, making it less necessary at the high school level. Also, in university, you'll be typing a hell of a lot. I don't care what course you take, you'll need to type up essays and ultimately a thesis paper.   Am I overblowing this? To quote the great Mugatu, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. To me it's at least as important as learning how to write with a pen these days. I'd just like to understand why society currently seems to place no value in this skill, and that maybe I'm overreacting.   **Edit 1**  Well, thanks for all the comments, it's been a very interesting discussion so far.   The argument that's hanging onto me the most is that the keyboard may become obsolete, but I can't see that happening soon enough to justify ignoring a useful skill.  For those who point out that we can learn it of our own free will and it's not the university's place, I feel that the long-term benefits of such a policy change benefit us in the long term. Universities often require you to study other things they feel are beneficial, such as learning another language (which is often taught inadequately), so I don't feel that it's outside the potential scope of a university to require typing.  And for those pointing out that it isn't worth the time, I maintain that learning costs next to nothing, and it saves you time over the course of your life if you add up every time you type.  **Edit 2, View Changed**  /u/cheeseboyardee made the point that not everyone learns at the same rate and some people may not be able to learn to type well, and thus mandating it could exclude otherwise capable people.   Thanks for all the posts and cordial discussion.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Typing &amp;quot;the quick fox jumped over the lazy brown dog&amp;quot; over and over again for an entire week with a piece of paper covering the keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I topped out at about 30 WPM after 10 weeks of the course with more typos and misplaced spaces than are appropriate. (About 20 WPM if I was copying text.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By looking at the keyboard I actually slow my mind down to focus on the word I am typing at the moment instead of getting ahead of myself. Moves me up to 40-50 wpm with fewer mistakes. To catch up to how fast the words go through my head I would need to be closer to my reading speed (300ish WPM).  The speed difference trying to touch type is unbearable, the increase in allowing myself to see the keyboard helps make it bearable. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Offering touch typing courses is going to be a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Requiring it for admission is not. Especially in countries that have massive disparities between school districts in terms of the availability of technology. Not every student has regular prolonged access to a keyboard or the internet in order to develop that skill. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Saying anything is &amp;quot;Easy to learn&amp;quot; leaves off the second half of that sentence. Which is &amp;quot;...For me.&amp;quot; Other people have different skills and abilities and learn different skills at different rates. Even something as simple as singing a simple tune is nearly impossible for some. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m an engineering grad student, and I never saw a need to type faster. If you&amp;#39;re writing so quickly that you&amp;#39;re limited by your WPM, you&amp;#39;re probably not being very concise. For example it takes me about 10-20 hours to write a 3000 word paper. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Based on your reasoning, speed reading would be 100x more useful than being able to type fast. Would you support a mandatory speed reading class for everyone?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: guys and girls can NEVER be 'just friends',"First Let me just say I am 16 and don't have much experience with how it is in the 'adult world'. But I don't think a 100% platonic relationship can exist between a straight male and a straight female.   Can you think back to any friendship and say with absolute certainty that there was never even a hint of attraction? And even if you can, how do you know they don't or never haven't felt that way?  It doesn't even need to be acted on to affect the relationship. It often with subconsciously. From my personal experience, this sort of friendship doesn't exist.   So, change my view, Reddit!  ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sort of logic seems a bit backwards to me.  To me, a relationship is not possible without the people being friends first.  To say the possibility of a relationship precludes a true friendship doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense to me, because there is no possibility of a relationship without the friendship.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To think about it from a different perspective, do you think that bi people are incapable of having a friendship?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I strongly disagree, based on the fact that I have several female friends with whom I have nothing more than a friendly relationship.  In most cases, we&amp;#39;re both married.  Are some of them attractive?  Sure, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the friendship is somehow altered because of that.  And plenty of them I absolutely don&amp;#39;t find attractive, and wouldn&amp;#39;t be attracted to them even if I were single, yet I&amp;#39;m still friends with them for the same reason I&amp;#39;m friends with guys.  I just enjoy talking to them and doing fun stuff with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: The best strategy on Cutthroat Kitchen is to dogpile.,"Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality TV cooking show where contestants bid on sabotages to make their competitors fail at cooking the dish that needs to be cooked, and keep the money remaining.  Often, this requires picking a competitor who gets sabotaged.  E.g. ""One of your opponents will give up all their ingredients and have to make their tacos using just what they can recover from this day old salad bar.""  This view is about what the best strategy for handing out a sabotage is.  I think that in the first 2 rounds, when you have a choice, you should always target whoever already has a sabotage.  So if someone gave another competitor the salad bar, and then you're handing out who has to give up all utensils for tinfoil, you should always pick the person who got the salad bar.  The reason is this: you do not win a round of CTK.  You just refrain from losing.  Having the best dish is no better than having the second or third best dish in round one.  You are best off by trying to guarantee one person fails totally.  Because then they go home.  Spreading out the sabotages means its less likely that they'll be crippling (since they're tested to be doable).  If you pile them all on one person though, it becomes much more likely they'll totally fail, thus saving you.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I&amp;#39;ve seen people blow their money too early and have no way to defend themselves in the later rounds. Also you help avoid revenge sabotages, the first round can be such a crap shoot and while the dogpile might ensure one person leaves, you don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve dogpiled a strong chef or a weak chef and wasted money.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now in the second round I could see this working. If you and the third chef realizes that chef #2 is very strong and adaptable, dogpiling chef #2 would be a solid strategy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I agree that this is usually the best strategy, you have stated it more absolutely than is justified.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First: there&amp;#39;s an alternate strategy that says you should always target the person who you think would be your (personal) toughest competitor, leaving the weaker opponents to survive. Sometimes this may override the advantage that dogpiling provides. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That said... it really depends on what the sabotages are. I don&amp;#39;t think there can really be any one perfect strategy that doesn&amp;#39;t depend on specific situations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just to use a contrived example (but one which I have seen occur): One of your opponents forgot to get eggs in a baking challenge. You have a sabotage that removes someone&amp;#39;s eggs. Under no circumstances should you give your sabotage to that person, even if they already have 2 sabotages assigned to them. Dogpiling would be the worst possible strategy in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are many similar examples, such of them more subtle, such as someone that has already lost their knives being given a second sabotage that takes away ingredients that need to be cut, and replaces them with precut ingredients of lesser quality. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, much of the time, the &amp;quot;dogpile&amp;quot; strategy doesn&amp;#39;t really help, because very often the first sabotage equally effects all of your opponents. So at the very least, an &lt;em&gt;additional&lt;/em&gt; strategy is needed beyond just &amp;quot;dogpile&amp;quot;. And it&amp;#39;s never helpful on the first sabotage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Punishment has little value in deterring bad behavior and is primary motivated by an innate human love of violence,"I think the real reason people punish others for transgressions is not so much to discourage the behavior, but rather to channel humanity's inherently predatory nature in a way that's socially acceptable and does not contradict with the moral values we have invented (or discovered, depending on how you look at it).  Most people feel a smug sense of satisfaction if they hear about a bully being beat up, or a murderer being executed by the state. Humans, being predatory creatures, have a certain sense of bloodlust and channeling this predatory instinct towards people who are predatory allows them to continue to view themselves as not being predators, while still enjoying violence.  Even bullies often justify their torments of victims as a form of punishment for not fitting the social norms, being ""annoying"" or acting in a way that is in their eyes unacceptable. Serial killers also often see their acts as a sort of punishment towards humanity. Rapists are often motivated by a desire to punish women. It seems like evil deeds are often motivated by a perverted sense of justice rather than mere selfishness or greed.  Another reason I think punishment has more to do with humans enjoying violence than it does with stopping bad behavior is the fact that corporal punishment of children is still very popular and defended by the majority of adults. I always felt like my parents took pleasure in punishing me, so I may be biased, but I really do think parents spank their children more out of anger and frustration than out of a will to help them develop.  Another reason I think it's innate is because the moral goodness of punishment is something virtually everybody agrees on. Liberals and conservatives alike usually have a ""tough on crime"" stance and would rather a violent criminal receive a harsh punishment even if it's more expensive and makes them less likely to be rehabilitated, than a lesser punishment that rehabilitated them more effectively. This sentiment is prevalent in every culture, even in societies like Scandinavia where the laws are more lenient.  We punish people because we perceive them as ""deserving it"" ie, we despise them and lust for their blood because we perceive them as being no longer part of the same species, and something that needs to be predated upon for the benefit of the community.  I actually think if there was no prison or capital punishment it would have very little effect on crime rates. The few people who are truly serial offenders could just be put in hospitals and the rest will eventually be released from prison anyway and will be far crazier on release after spending decades in the pen.  In a nutshell, I think punishment has actually caused far more evil than it's prevented and is really just an outlet for our inherent cruelty as a meat-eating species at the top of the food chain. Punishing people we consider ""bad"" also has the effect of affirming our own self righteousness.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

CMV: It's both invasive and sexist for /r/ladybonersgw to require submitters post their face,"**Edit:** I've been fairly convinced it's not sexist. Still maintain invasive as all heck. Carry on, thanks for getting passionate about it!  **Edit 2:** 7 hours and only a few personal insults later... I've heard a lot of great things I agree with but I still feel it's invasive by nature to ask that much of submitters to a general gw subreddit.   **Final Edit:** [It's been done.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3djk9x/cmv_its_both_invasive_and_sexist_for/ct6796p) I still think it's an invasive thing to ask of someone sharing their nude body but I'm glad a community member could shed light on the creation of the subreddit.   ---  Browsing naked bodies casually when I noticed that over at /r/ladybonersgw they require at least half of a guys face to be shown with every submission. Here's the rule with the line that made me go 'wait, that doesn't make any sense...' in bold.  &gt;  All posts must contain at least half your face. We must clearly be able to see some of your features! I.e. mouth and nose/eyes and nose. If this minimum requirement is not met, a face picture must be posted in the comments. **This means that we DO NOT allow text-only posts.** All posts must contain at least one image which fulfils rule two.  It looks like it's enforced very often.  Reasons I think this is shocking and inappropriate:  * Sharing yourself nude on the internet is super taboo and the vast majority of people who do, for safety and privacy, would never show part or all of their face.  * It seems like a really silly and irrelevant way to accomplish no text posts.   * If this was a rule on a female gonewild, I feel like there'd be some sort of outrage at the invasiveness. Kinda like 'I'm sharing how much of myself, now everyone feels entitled to my face too?'  * As someone who wants to start enjoying the posts, it limits who is going to be posting which is disappointing.   * If the point was to avoid 'floating dicks' everywhere, which makes more sense than the reasoning they give, then the amount of body shown should be the requirement.   I don't think anyone should have to compromise their identity or do something many would be really uncomfortable with to be allowed to post on a subreddit. What am I missing that this rule is embraced?   *Disclaimer: Not an angry submitter or anything. I want to enjoy an overflowing of peen.*  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Men are presenting pictures of themselves because they are getting something out of the experience. No one can be required to show their face on the internet,  they can be required to show their face to meet the criteria of the subreddit &lt;em&gt;if they want to submit to it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to use an exaggerated example to demonstrate the idea. Say we have a subreddit called &lt;a href=""/r/sexyelbowsgw""&gt;r/sexyelbowsgw&lt;/a&gt; that is a community for hot young ladies to post pictures of their bare elbows. A requirement for submissions to that subreddit would probably include that at least one elbow be visible. This would likely not be challenged by anyone, because obviously, that&amp;#39;s what that subreddit is for. People who like seeing elbows, and people interested in posting the sort of pictures that include elbows. The subreddit exists for people who want to see pics that meet that criteria, and those who are uncomfortable sharing their naked elbows with us would surely not post there. No one is requiring, or even asking them to, it&amp;#39;s just that the sub exists for the kinds of pics that involve elbows.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ladybonersgw isn&amp;#39;t any different, it&amp;#39;s just a community for people who like or want to post sexy pictures of men that include faces, instead of elbows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;CMV: It&amp;#39;s both invasive and sexist for &lt;a href=""/r/ladybonersgw""&gt;/r/ladybonersgw&lt;/a&gt; to require submitters post their face&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your assumption is that someone who was going to post on &lt;a href=""/r/ladybonersgw""&gt;/r/ladybonersgw&lt;/a&gt; without a face was then coerced into posting while showing a face.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s consider the alternative.  What if only the men who are comfortable sharing their face share and everyone else is filtered out?  Those people then go elsewhere if they need to share their body.  In what way would that be invasive or sexist?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, I think it comes down to supply and demand.  In every dating site, I have heard female friends say that they receive pictures of guy&amp;#39;s dicks.  Disembodied dicks have flooded the market and they are just not very much of an offering for a subreddit.  In contrast, women don&amp;#39;t send pictures of themselves as often.  So &lt;a href=""/r/gonewild""&gt;/r/gonewild&lt;/a&gt; can be alluring without having the same demands.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yes, the sexes are treated differently, but I don&amp;#39;t see how it is sexist.  The difference in treatment comes as a response from a contextual behavior, not as an oppression.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV:English should not be the international language,"I think English should not be the international language for these reasons:  It's proven that is really hard to understand how to pronounce some words here /u/BrotherChe makes a really good point in another thread I saw. http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3aj3vc/udefstones123_realizes_what_grower_not_a_shower/csdbnl5. Other languages such as Spanish the pronunciation of a word is pretty straight forward.  I understand that the conjugation is the only tough part and the whole gender thing might be confusing at first (not that crazy if it ends on an a it's female, except agua which can be both, the only tough part is if it end on an e). Also English is not even the most spoken language in the world where Mandarin is first followed by Spanish. English is rising only because it's commonly being taught as a second language, if you change the language it will also rise.  Also the whole small scale system that English has does not even make sense like why a billion is a thousand of a million where in long scale it's a million of a million.  I know this seems biased like I am arguing that Spanish should be the international language and it's my native language, but it makes more sense if it were. I didn't defend Mandarin because I've always had the impression of it being one of the hardest language to master. If it's otherwise I apologize and anyone who speaks other languages are welcome to support why your language should be the international language.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

In terms of communicating with people you&amp;#39;re likely to be in a position to want to communicate with, English has a lot in its favor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There is certainly a case to be made that there are better choices if everyone agreed to ignore those factors.  See Esperanto.

CMV: I agree with the Nazi 'Action T4' program.,"Hello. For a long time now I've felt that there are many people in hospitals and psychiatric homes who will never be able to function independently and will never work, create art and music, etc..

If you have no idea what you want to do in college, you're going to waste lots of time.  * Lots of college kids are entitled because parents/government pay for everything.  And they think they automatically deserve a high-paying job just because they graduated.  Nope, gotta work your way up from the bottom.  Nobody's too good for an entry-level job.  * Oh, and it doesn't hurt to have a little more on your resume.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

CMV: New York City should abolish rent regulations.,"NYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization.  Both of them should be abolished, though gradually.  I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but that:  * Current units cannot be transferred to a new tenant.  If the original tenant on the lease at the time of the decontrol law vacates the unit, the unit can be listed by the landlord at market rates.  Currently, other occupants related to the lessor can inherit the lease, meaning units pass down in families indefinitely.  * Newly constructed or rented units are not subject to any controls.  * Rents in all controlled units can rise by up to 5% per year.  * Rent decontrol be coupled with large scale upzoning to allow more housing to come on to the market.  This will include infill construction in NYCHA housing projects where developers are willing to pay market rates for the land.  * Buildings which received Mitchell-Lama or other tax subsidies must pay back the subsidies with interest before decontrolling units which were built as a condition of the subsidy, on a pro-rated basis.  The reason I want to abolish rent regulations in NYC is that it drastically reduces the available housing supply and harms people looking to move to or within the city.  Anyone who has won the rent regulation lottery never moves out, and you end up with a highly inefficient allocation of apartments within the city.  It also hugely depresses the creation of new rental units within the city, because new landlords see what happened to old landlords who got stuck with controlled units.  I don't think there should be a property right in a rental.  If you want a property interest in the place where you live, you should buy it.  If you're renting, you should be subject to the market forces that come with that.  **Edit 1:**  I was hoping to get some replies before I had to step away, but so far it's just crickets.  Will be away from computer for about an hour and a half or so, and will reply when I'm back. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The major problem I have with decontrolling as a remedy is that (1) it will make for a painful transition period, and (2) the decontrol argument, that rents will stabilize on their own once regulation is lifted, makes theoretical sense but might not bear out in the real world. In other words, while theoretically sound, the real-world ramifications are short-term pain for long-term.... something. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, my first push-back to you is, has this been tried elsewhere? What happened in those cities? Or, how have rents fared in cities without rent regulation? Basically: is there any &lt;em&gt;empirical&lt;/em&gt; basis for decontrolling? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Second, I assume your end-goal is to increase the available housing supply, and by doing so, drive down rents or at least check the rate of rising rents. If so, there are other more politically palatable means to the same end. Chief among them, &lt;a href=""http://www.citylab.com/housing/2015/05/why-billionaires-dont-pay-property-taxes-in-new-york/389886/?utm_source=nymagFB""&gt;real property tax reform&lt;/a&gt;. Today, owners of rental buildings pay disproportionately higher taxes than owners of condominiums. Naturally, rental building owners pass those taxes onto their tenants. By reshuffling the tax structure to invert that disparity, the cost of running the city could be made to fall &lt;em&gt;at least equally&lt;/em&gt; on owners of pied-a-terre&amp;#39;s. Theoretically, owners would pass their own tax savings on to their tenants in the form of reduced rents. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, rent regulation, even in the city, is a &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; issue. The state, which leans conservative, is more likely to repeal the rent laws than the more progressive city. But state legislators would face &lt;em&gt;intense&lt;/em&gt; backlash from downstate representatives. It would arguably empower De Blasio, too, who has otherwise been flagging, since he would look like the savior of the City against Albany&amp;#39;s out-of-touch, careless conservatism. (I&amp;#39;m not saying I believe this, I&amp;#39;m saying it&amp;#39;s how it would be sold.) The last thing Albany wants to do -- the &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; last thing Cuomo wants to do -- is make De Blasio look reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;By contrast, city property taxes are a &lt;em&gt;city&lt;/em&gt; issue; unlike De Blasio&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;millionaire tax,&amp;quot; he wouldn&amp;#39;t need Albany approval to cut taxes for rental property owners (and by extension the middle class) and raise taxes on luxury condo owners (the upper class). But Albany could seize the chance to continue characterizing him, however unfairly (in this case), as an un-serious politician and class warrior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What could be done to moot this nascent political conflict is, accomplish both plans separately, but by agreement, as a package deal that exposes neither side to political backlash. Albany, placated by the phased repeal of rent reofrm and, could forgive De Blasio his tax restructuring and promise not to fight back against it. De Blasio and city politicos, placated by tax restructuring, could forgive Albany and promise not to fight back against rent increases. In other words: while abolishing rent regulation might never happen on its own, it might happen, and be more effective, passed together with tax reform. This is not so much to change your view on the &lt;em&gt;intellectual merit&lt;/em&gt; of letting rent protection lapse, but rather, to change your view on that as a panacea. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;[edited last paragraph for clarity/sentence structure issues]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two things... first if you want to move to NYC, you should know that NYC does not want you. You walk too slow, you talk too slow, you probably brought a car you can&amp;#39;t park; much less drive. You&amp;#39;re going to bitch and moan about prices, and eat at chain restaurants named after days of the week. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To the folks in the city... you&amp;#39;re just an asshole. Slow when you should be fast, fast when you should be slow, and always talking shit. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You will notice on your drive into the city that the tolls are one way. This is so there is no barrier to you getting out. Seriously, there are 10 million people in the city at almost any time and only 8 million live there. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NYC doesn&amp;#39;t want you. NYC wants the people that live there to be invested in their neighborhood. Rent control does that because they know that they aren&amp;#39;t getting kicked out because some whiter folks wanna move in. You know you can&amp;#39;t find a less expensive place, so you look into ways you can improve or keep your neighborhood from turning into a cess pool. Barring an extreme event like the introduction of an extremely inexpensive, powerful, highly addictive drug this helps. (Although I accept that a case can be made that the permanence also encourages gangs based on territory... but tbh those happen everywhere.) &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;White flight&amp;quot; was not as big of an issue for NYC as it was for other cities in part because of rent control.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rent control is also going to phase out on its own as those living in rent controlled apartments age and pass away. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rent stabilization on the other hand is a statewide thing. It&amp;#39;s also needed statewide. Although each municipality gets to decide if it&amp;#39;s needed in that particular city.  First reason I can think of to answer the question of &amp;quot;why is it needed?&amp;quot; is the SUNY system. While most states have two or three cities for their state colleges... NY has over 60. For comparison UC has only 9. There are more people in California than there are in NY. For landlords of a less than honest and forthright disposition college students are low hanging fruit. Rent increases for sub-standard multi-unit housing because they know parents or loans are going to pay the rent, and the students don&amp;#39;t know better. They&amp;#39;re just happy they found a place for themselves and their 3 best friends they won&amp;#39;t be able to stand at the end of the year. Rent control/stabilization helps to prevent these abuses. If the educated college students have issues with understanding their rights imagine how screwed poor less educated people are. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yeah... So point one in a nutshell is that the city doesn&amp;#39;t want you, but is willing to invest in the people that already call it home. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Break for Specific ideas:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Current units cannot be transferred to a new tenant. If the original tenant on the lease at the time of the decontrol law vacates the unit, the unit can be listed by the landlord at market rates. Currently, other occupants related to the lessor can inherit the lease, meaning units pass down in families indefinitely. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So Guy gets an apartment, signs the lease (original tenant) gets married and dies in a horrible accident.. now his widow not only has to deal with her husbands death, but her rent goes up too because she wasn&amp;#39;t an &amp;quot;original tenant&amp;quot;? Damn, that&amp;#39;s just cold. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is the scenario that legacy rent control protects. Yes a kid might move back into their parents apartment, but generally they will have their own lives and careers by the time their parents pass away/ vacate the apartment. By keeping legacy controls vague and open, we allow for some abuse (in the opinions of some) but the cost of that abuse is still less than the cost of elimination of the benefit, and the confusion/expense created by trying to create/enforce caveats for every special situation. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Newly constructed or rented units are not subject to any controls.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In terms of specific &amp;quot;rent control&amp;quot;... this has been the situation for forty some odd years. Stabilization continues, but exempting new construction would encourage the destruction/reconstruction or re-habbing of existing housing in order to create New/newly rented units. Ex 10 story rent controlled/stabilized building with 200 tenants is razed to build a 15 story building that houses 300... The original 200 now need to find another home and won&amp;#39;t be able to afford to move back into the apartment that now occupies the same space as their old home.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Rents in all controlled units can rise by up to 5% per year.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Confused here as currently can&amp;#39;t landlords petition for a change of up to 7.5% for a year? And at 5% a year.. in ten years time there will be a ~50% discrepancy between the increase in rent and inflation (using a ballpark average recent rate of 2% per year)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Rent decontrol be coupled with large scale upzoning to allow more housing to come on to the market. This will include infill construction in NYCHA housing projects where developers are willing to pay market rates for the land.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Housing projects, while well-intentioned, have a serious history of segregation and exacerbating the effects of criminal activity on a community. While rent-control works by putting people from different socio-economic backgrounds in close proximity, public houses homogenizes the socio-economic backgrounds of the people living there. This is NOT a good thing for our society. A ghetto (in the classical definition not the &amp;quot;black neighborhood&amp;quot; definition) is essentially a combination of /r spacedicks and /r circlejerk. The worst aspects of the community have a very high short term reward at the expense of long term growth and the community in general. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Buildings which received Mitchell-Lama or other tax subsidies must pay back the subsidies with interest before decontrolling units which were built as a condition of the subsidy, on a pro-rated basis.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Subsidies with conditions need to have the conditions met to continue, although allowing negotiations for a subsidy to turn into a loan existing is not a bad idea as situations change and being able to respond to that change is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The rental rights in NY and NYC specifically were created because of abuses by landlords. The &amp;quot;property rights&amp;quot; of a tenant were established to protect against those abuses. Todays landlords aren&amp;#39;t more moral and caring than their 19th/10th century counterparts, and eliminating those rights will again normalize those abuses. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Point 2: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Without some form of rent control or stabilization rents would initially increase (and drastically) however the people who make the city actually run would be forced out of their homes. There would be a lag time because evictions take time, but suddenly there wouldn&amp;#39;t be anybody to do the jobs that need doing in the city. Without basic things like the subway, trash collection, waiters at restaurants, actors performing in off-Broadway shows.. the bubble created by the elimination of controls/stabilization would pop. This would crash the market leaving the speculative landlords who were so eager to see controls removed holding worthless property. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While it&amp;#39;s possible that the people would just move back... it&amp;#39;s doubtful. Look at Detroit. That is what happens to a city when it&amp;#39;s primary draw/ industry is destroyed. NYC needs its artists and the working class that generates good artists. Those people need someplace to live that they can afford. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to go to NYC to look at a stock broker or accountant. Sorry to all those stockbrokers out there. You might be nice, but you&amp;#39;re not interesting to watch. A broadway show.. even the cheesy trite pieces like &amp;quot;Cats&amp;quot; are entertaining. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What would America have in terms of art without NYC? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Mark Twain, gospel, folk, country, and bluegrass. That&amp;#39;s pretty much it. Ok... Chicago might have a claim on popularizing/ spreading the blues beyond the Mississippi flood plains, but it&amp;#39;s hotly contested by NYC.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jazz would have languished in New Orleans if it weren&amp;#39;t for the Cotton Clubs and radio broadcasts out of NY. Punk as an idea was around for a bit, but NYC and CBGB&amp;#39;s specifically were its physical and spiritual home.  But without the content from NY, Hollywood would have had nothing to film until the mid 70&amp;#39;s. No Lenny Bruce, no George Carlin, no late night TV to speak of although Carson was a west coast guy the gig originated in the east. Rock and Roll didn&amp;#39;t have a meaningful home until Alan Freed hit NYC.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Without NYC&amp;#39;s unique combination of blue collar and upper upper white collar experiences most of the art and entertainment we know and take for granted today wouldn&amp;#39;t exist. That isn&amp;#39;t an exaggeration, if anything it&amp;#39;s an understatement. Yes, Atlanta, Seattle, St. Louis, San Francisco and other cities have had some major influences in specific time periods, but we keep coming back to NYC. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Why? Because more than any other city in the country the rich and poor live side by side. Taking the same trains, complaining about the same weather, sharing the same barstools. Because rent control and stabilization are inefficient, sloppy, and have all of what you perceive to be negative effects. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So while there might be some short term benefits to the pockets of certain landlords... the long term effects will decimate the city at worst, make it bland and irrelevant at best. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"CMV: Scholarships that Are Available to People of Only a Certain Group (whether gender, religion, origin, race, etc.) are Unfair to People Excluded From It","I've been pursuing a lot of scholarships and one of the things that irritate me is that there are certain scholarships that are not available to me based on my traits assigned by birth. (Male, Caucasian).   I'm not trying to suggest that I am entitled to every single scholarship and this is by no means a vitriolic rant at people who do qualify for said scholarships. But I am specifically against scholarships that rely on people of academic or athletic standing as their criteria but exclude people for not matching into the group they allow applications for. There are people who may deserve a scholarship more, based on achievement, but cannot have the chance to even try.  I'm sure that there must be a reason for this (as that's why I'm here today in the first place) but I can't find any reasoning that I can justify for such exclusion.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Being a white male, you are statistically more likely to be in the front running for those 80 other scholarships. This is not your fault, as you didn&amp;#39;t choose to be a white male, but the 20 people who are in the front running for the other scholarships didn&amp;#39;t choose that either, and I&amp;#39;m sure if the system was fair, they would be advocating for the elimination of special requirement scholarships, but the fact of the matter is the system isn&amp;#39;t fair. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take a look at the inner-city public high school system for a moment. These schools are woefully underfunded, woefully underserved, and (generally speaking) are largely minority based. Chances are the students who attend said high school will not be afforded the privileges of those who attend a more well-to-do high school in the suburbs (eg SAT/ACT prep courses, AP classes, etc.), thus making them (potentially) less likely to have the requirements necessary for certain scholarships. This is not the fault of the student, it is the fault of a broken system.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Long story short, I suppose, people from traditionally more privileged heritages (eg: white males) are more likely to obtain the criteria necessary for scholarships, based purely on the failings of the public school system, and that is why race and gender based scholarships apply. Because those students who get race based scholarships prove to be just as successful at the college level, but perhaps wouldn&amp;#39;t get the chance if not for scholarships geared towards them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scholarships are by their very nature exclusive. Either they discriminate on merit or they discriminate based on race/gender. Many schools use scholarships to promote diversity, but not necessarily just racial diversity. They know that they can&amp;#39;t get every applicant they accept to enroll in the school, so a lot of schools will pad their &amp;quot;yield&amp;quot; (percentage of students accepted who enroll) by offering generous merit scholarships to top students. In the same way, if a school wants to help improve its perception with regards to diversity or race relations or social justice, it&amp;#39;s using scholarships to incentivize students with particular traits to enroll.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The scholarships that are designed for people who are not purely academic achievers were never meant for those students anyway. They wouldn&amp;#39;t exist without the school needing to create a diverse environment. Colleges can&amp;#39;t exist without the student bodies that make them up. Many colleges just hand out their scholarships to help mold their incoming class into the perfect blend (in their eyes).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: Children who do not get 1st-3rd place DO NOT deserve a trophy for simply participating,"Hello CMV,  I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from your basic youth teams) and never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing it was simple as that. By losing and not being rewarded we understood we had to try harder as an individual and try harder as a team to win. This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team.  I really dont understand the idea of rewarding everyone for not winning, it's almost like saying ""hey, even if you dont try you still win"". I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize. To me that just teaches a kid that NOT giving your best will still result in a prize. What lesson does that teach you when you grow up? That your failure or lack of effort will be rewarded regardless of how you performed? Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up? Personally if I had a kid and he/she played a sport I wouldn't allow the coach or a parent to give them a trophy for simply participating, I would make them understand that a reward/trophy is earned by hard work and dedication. I know not all kids are athletic but I still dont understand the concept or idea.  We all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? Again, I am not trying to sound cold but I just dont understand the concept of rewarding  failure/losing, CMV......  Edit: thanks for all the answers, feedback and insight. Many of you helped CMV. Again, I hope I didn't come off as cold or inconsiderate. I have younger cousins and love to see them succeed in anything they do, especially sports. I was more interested in having a discussion as to ""why"" and the mentality behind it. Many of you made valid arguments and gave me some great insight. I'm happy to keep discussing if people are interested but please note I am not against the idea but was more interested in helping me change my view of it. If anything please continue to give your children positive feedback, effective communication, motivation and let them know that team work is a great thing. I recommend everyone put their kids in sports (dont push them into it but help and guide them into something they love doing or are very passionate about). It really does pay off when you get older and helps them build some self confidence and understand the dynamics of a social environment. Thanks again everyone!   Edit 2: Since the discussion continues, I think children under 12 should only get participation Trophies. Once you hit that age you should be teaching your kids the fundamentals of structured team work, effort and the idea that life will not reward your for simply showing up. Giving participation trophies to kids 13 and above is not a good life lesson. If you care to continue CMV on that!   Edit 3: Thanks everyone for the continued conversation, input, points of views and personal experiences. This sub is great for people who are curious as to get the other sides opinion and everyone should keep an open mind about changing their view on the matter. Now some last bit of advice for coaches and parents who put their kids in sports. PLEASE keep your eye out for the that one un-athletic kid who might not be the best on the team and make sure that his/her team mates understand this is a team event and that everyone is in this together. Some of these personal experiences shared with me shed some light on how people hated playing sports  and were being bulled because they were that kid and the other kids made them feel left out. Not all kids will be good athletes but you can teach your kids to respect one another, support one another and to ensure that they understand the unity of team work. If your kid is that ""all-star"" on the team then make them understand this most because the other kids will look to him/her to see how they treat the rest of the team.

The good trophy. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Honestly, if anything, getting that small trophy or plaque is a constant reminder that you &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; win, and should serve as more motivation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I remember the 2nd place trophies when I lost the championship soccer match leaving a bad taste in my mouth until I was able to get a 1st place one to put next to it the following year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grew up solidly in the participation award era of the 90&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Know what?

Cool medium sized trophies.  Shit you could be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The rest of us? These junky little trinkets that paled in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And we wanted the big trophy. Getting a little concilation trophy didn&amp;#39;t remove that desire to win.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Why not? At least you showed up and played.  That&amp;#39;s all the that trophy is.  It doesn&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;Congratulations, you won!&amp;quot; it says &amp;quot;Yep, you played this year.&amp;quot;  I don&amp;#39;t see what&amp;#39;s wrong with a commemorative trophy for that.  It&amp;#39;s not a winners trophy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I&amp;#39;m not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;How about rewarding someone for showing up when they could have easily not done anything at all?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a lot easier to stay at home and play video games and watch TV and not do anything at all. All the participation trophy does is say that you competed.  What&amp;#39;s so bad about that?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not without precedence either.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All Olympic Athletes receive a participation medal for qualifying.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t that give the child a bad mentality growing up?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That winners get big ass trophy&amp;#39;s and losers get something that says they showed up? What&amp;#39;s bad about that?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Except reality is that hard work doesn&amp;#39;t always translate to just rewards.

"CMV: If straight and cis people attend a Pride parade, they should spend some of their time there volunteering.","Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA+ friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never gone to one myself (always find out about it a few days after it happens), but I'm planning on going to volunteer at next year's Boston parade, assuming I'm home from school in time.  I personally get a little uncomfortable when I see straight people partying hard at Pride parades. To me, the parades are supposed to celebrate marginalized social groups who are often shoved under wave after wave of oppression and hatred the other 364 days of the year and has this one day to fully let loose and celebrate in the face of a culture who still may not accept them in the way that they'd like. When straight people jump in, it almost feels like they're co-opting the one day in which non-straight people are finally in control. It seems to me to be similar to straight people putting a rainbow filter over their profile pictures - in theory, it might be OK, but in practice it shifts the attention from the LGBTQA+ people who deserve it onto the straight person who steps in. Almost like a ""Look at me, I'm celebrating pride! Look at how great I am!""  And, yeah, to a certain extent I think this display of solidarity is good. Gay/trans/queer rights won't move forward without the support of those already in power - straight people - and it's nice to see people united across gender and sexuality boundaries in order to celebrate how far we've come and prepare for how far we still have to go. That being said, though, I think there's a point at which a display of solidarity becomes less about the people for whom the solidarity is shown and more about the people who are ""showing"" the solidarity. I think that at a certain point, support for the LGBTQA+ community can transition into an exercise in self-promotion and narcissism, and I'm not super comfortable with that.  This is why I think that straight/cis people who participate in Pride parades should spend some of that participation on volunteering. The parades really run on volunteers, and if a straight/cis person spends time doing the thankless task of picking up trash, filling and lugging big containers of water everywhere, or making sure a first-aid tent is properly staffed, it helps show support for the LGBTQA+ community in a way that simply taking selfies with a shirtless parader will never be able to. I think it's a great way to be an ally to the community in a way that doesn't obnoxiously trumpet that allyship, and it might teach people more about what really makes the revelry run smoothly and give them a new appreciation for something many almost take for granted.  tl;dr Volunteering is a helpful form of allyship for straight/cis people in a way that just going to the parade and celebrating is not.  **EDIT:** Just a clarification - I believe that people shouldn't be *forced* to volunteer, and going to the parade at all is still preferable by far to not going. That said, I think that going and volunteering is far enough preferable to just going to participate that it should be pretty heavily suggested for people planning to go.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"CMV: I'm anti abortion, and I feel like an asshole for being so.","WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that.     Most of the people that I look up to in life and seem to agree with all seem to support abortion. The people I see on the internet are supported for calling out someone who is against abortion, for instance reddit, to support abortion seems to be the widely regarded popular opinion. This probably isn't the best way to put it, but I seem to agree with every other popular political opinion on reddit (I should have thoughts of my own, and shouldn't form my opinions based upon some random website.) I like making fun of racist old assholes, I like making fun if homophobic old assholes, I like making fun of sexist old assholes, and I like making fun of religious old bigots, etc. etc. etc. But abortion seems to be the thing I disagree with, and I kind of feel like an asshole, like I must be missing some key point. I feel terrible that I have the opinion I do, because everyone seems to hate those who have it, and that's why I've come here, I must be missing some sort of point, and I hope that you can point it out for me. At first I just thought I didn't understand the issue well enough, but after I came to understand both sides of the debate, I can't help but wonder why everyone just accepts that a fetus isn't alive, and are kind of ignoring the moral implications of what if it's not? It's not that I think the fetus is necessarily alive, it's more along the lines that I don't think that you can prove that it's not alive (I genuinely don't think we will ever be able to definitively prove it). However I am going to counter my own argument here in saying that you can't prove that rocks aren't sentient either in the philosophical sense, but there is at least reason to believe that a fetus is more alive than a rock. When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality. Now I realize that it's not always consensual sex, and having to carry the child of someone who assaulted you is an absolutely horrendous thing, I would not wish that on my worst enemy, and I don't say that lightly, I really truly wouldn't. I can only imagine feeling as though I would just want to tear the child out no matter what. Never the less, life is life, a fetus is innocent, and the best I can recommend is some extreme therapy taken to whatever (healthy) extent necessary to help a person cope with such a thing. The ""it's going to happen anyway"" mindset I believe is just lazy, there are so many things on this planet that are going to happen anyway, are we just going to let them happen?     Of those who are fine with people having a different opinion, it seems as though the popular opinion among them is that those who are anti abortion should shut up and keep it to themselves, don't bother anyone with it, but to be honest I even disagree with that, I don't get mad at those who picket abortion clinics, I don't see it as a bad thing to do, they literally see abortion as murder, even if you do support abortion, try to get in that mindset, seeing something as murder and being told to shut up and ignore it. (This is also why I don't get mad at animal rights activists, I've seriously considered going vegan, and I kind of think following my own philosophy, it's selfish and hypocritical of me that I'm not.) I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live. We're having two different discussions and getting pissed at each other for not coming to the same conclusion. I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it's not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy. And maybe that's why I don't understand, maybe if it even remotely affected me my opinion would be different. I'm not certain. But please help me change my view, I feel like a total ignorant asshole.       TL;DR: I feel like an asshole for being against abortion _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

From a biological perspective, a fetus is definitely alive, as is anything made up of cells. When you say alive, are you referring to consciousness? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For me, whether or not it is &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; to kill a fetus is basically dependent on whether or not the fetus values its own life (i.e. wants to stay alive/wants to not die). For me, this makes the question pretty clear cut throughout most of pregnancy. You need to be able to think (i.e. have a mind) to value your own life, and all evidence points to the necessity of brain activity in order to think. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that a fetus must have brain activity in order for it to value its own life (and by extension for it to be wrong to kill the fetus). Before about 24 weeks, a fetus doesn&amp;#39;t have brain activity, so I assume that it doesn&amp;#39;t value its life at least during those first 24 weeks, and that it is acceptable to kill it. Even when a fetus does develop brain activity, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it will value its own life, but it&amp;#39;s much easier to draw a line at existence/nonexistence of brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus&amp;#39;s right to live. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think that the &amp;quot;person&amp;#39;s right to do what they want with their body&amp;quot; argument is pretty ridiculous. I think this because (1) if you don&amp;#39;t believe that a fetus is a person with a right life, then that argument really doesn&amp;#39;t matter anyway because killing the fetus is OK (2) if you believe that a fetus is a person with a right to life, that argument essentially says that when person X&amp;#39;s continued existence is sufficiently dependent on person Y, and person Y finds person X&amp;#39;s continued existence inconvenient, they&amp;#39;re allowed to kill X. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it&amp;#39;s not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy.

I&amp;#39;m not certain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Call me hyperrational, but I think that that rational conclusions should not be swayed when you realize that they are hard to live with. They should only be changed when you encounter something that alters your base assumptions or when you realize that your reasoning was faulty. If you change your beliefs based on what advances your interests, then you might as well just stop attempting to justify them rationally in the first place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody is saying fetuses aren&amp;#39;t alive. They are. They just should not be considered as &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; organisms that are subject to moral principles. My hand is &amp;#39;alive&amp;#39; in the same sense as a fetus is, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean cutting it off is the same as killing a person or animal. People often say fetuses develop into humans in time, therefore they are humans, but this does not account for the fact that they require the mother&amp;#39;s body to do so. A zygote does not &amp;#39;naturally&amp;#39; develop into a human without outside influence. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you have sex, you know it&amp;#39;s a possibility to get pregnant, it&amp;#39;s kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that&amp;#39;s the reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When you get in a car and drive somewhere, you know it&amp;#39;s a possibility that some idiot may crash into you, regardless of how careful you are.

"CMV: Fireworks are really boring, have little to do with celebrating independence, and are not worth the risk.","A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of $500 on fireworks.  I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but after a few minutes, what else is there but more of the same?  But this private display, ergh.  One, two, three tubes, willows, spinners, blah blah blah.  An hour and a half of this?  I got good and buzzed, and gave myself time to sober up, and still it went on and on and on.  No pace, no art, just whistle, bang, pretty lights.  And I drove home, and saw dozens of similar displays, all the same.    These people are just enjoying the bang and zoom and pretty lights, they are not commemorating anything.  And I've seen all kinds of stories, people injured, even killed, by these things, which in my opinion offer little or no excitement or entertainment.    _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

For you, fireworks may not offer much excitement so the risks of physical harm may not be worth the monetary cost or potential danger. However, you must recognize that there are many things which you may find boring but another person may find very entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For another person, fireworks may be the shit. They may spend all day and all night fantasizing about them. They may spontaneously orgasm every 4th of July for 5 hours gazing up at the sky.

You can&amp;#39;t possibly quantify what other people like.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the people that enjoy fireworks and fireworks shows, the relatively small risk (if you handle them properly) compared to the enjoyment they get from the experience is worth it for them. They are paying for a night which they hold fond in their memories, a sense of wonder, a feeling of pleasure. You may not understand it and may even consider it a waste of time and resources, but that&amp;#39;s OK. No one is holding a firecracker to your head and making you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, as a personal anecdote, this isn&amp;#39;t terribly uncommon. It seems people either love fireworks or hate them. I personally love them, but only when I&amp;#39;m the one lighting them.

Rockets and cannons firing all around you but you just kind of sit there and hope that the carnage doesn&amp;#39;t find you. &amp;quot;Bombs bursting in air&amp;quot; and all that. So I would argue that, in that sense, it is relevant to our independence.

Reckless endangerment in the first degree is a class D felony.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a violent class D felony, this would carry a minimum sentence of 2 years, and a maximum sentence of 7 years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If a person did in fact die during the raid, they&amp;#39;d be guilty of manslaughter in the second degree, defined as:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when:     1. He recklessly causes the death of another person; ...

But we start bumping into some irrationality then.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think swatting, without physical harm done, is the same severity as manslaughter.  Manslaughter is a really serious crime.  And if you want to upgrade the punishment if it becomes a manslaughter, then you&amp;#39;re talking about punishing it like a murder (murder is a class B felony, sometimes class A).  But it isn&amp;#39;t as serious as a murder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Swatting can be severely punished.  The crimes above carry substantial sentences.  A conviction for 1st degree reckless endangerment (which swatting is), has a mandatory minimum prison sentence, so it&amp;#39;s not like you can get off with a slap on the wrist.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But decades in prison is essentially reserved for murderers, rapists, and serial criminals.  And it should be.  /b/tards aren&amp;#39;t as evil as murderers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kid you&amp;#39;ve linked to in that news article is 17 right now. You&amp;#39;re saying he should face decades of imprisonment for what he&amp;#39;s done... now think about that, really. We throw around punishment very severely in our society, but really think about what you&amp;#39;re saying. If you lock him up for 20 years, he&amp;#39;ll get out when he&amp;#39;s 37; for 30 and he&amp;#39;ll be 47; for 40 and he&amp;#39;ll be 57 years old. We&amp;#39;re talking about a child&amp;#39;s life here. Granted, what he did is undoubtedly wrong, and I cannot imagine being a victim, having a SWAT team in full gear and weaponry busting down your family&amp;#39;s door has to be one of the scariest experiences I can think of. That said, this is still a 17 year old child. A moron really, if only by age. Can you imagine the person you were 10 years ago, and how different you were? Or the person you were in high school? This is just some idiot kid who thought he was pranking people. Put him away for 5 years, that&amp;#39;s still a massive amount of time, but when he gets out you&amp;#39;ll more than likely have someone who is truly sorry. If you don&amp;#39;t let him out until he&amp;#39;s in his 30&amp;#39;s or 40&amp;#39;s, you have effectively destroyed his entire life. He&amp;#39;ll have never finished school, gotten any job experience, he&amp;#39;s already got this criminal record, he&amp;#39;ll be getting into his older years so finding companionship will be much more difficult... Sometimes I think we lock some people away for far too long and don&amp;#39;t actually think about what it would have to be like sitting in a room for so many hundreds or thousands of days. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: The contribution of vegans/vegetarians and other environmentally conscious people is absolutely insignificant.,"I'll start off by saying I'm a vegetarian and I also try to limit the eggs and dairy I eat, I try to buy no leather and no other animal byproducts. When there are leftovers from dinners with guests, etc. I'll eat that (throwing meat away is definitely worse than eating it). I try to do as much as I can for the environment and animals, I have very little money so I do not donate to animal rights organizations but I certainly would if I could.  I'm trying to be as reasonable as possible on the subject, I try not to see individuals as evil 'cause they think it's normal to torture animals, I understand it's a cultural thing although I loathe humanity in general.  I also think the hypothetical contribution of even a billion of the strictest vegans imaginable wouldn't change things a bit.  As of today I'm making this choice exclusively because it makes me feel good / at peace with myself, 'cause if I think about the contribution to the environment, I'm sorry but I just can't believe I'm doing anything significant.  I'm 100% convinced on what I've done for a year now, and I'll become as ""vegan"" as possible in the future (I hate this whole ""vegan"" thing, it should be something natural like being against slavery), I'm NOT looking for an excuse to quit. But I know it'll only benefit my ethics and my self-esteem.  I know that for every person like me (and I'm nowhere near good) there are one thousand who don't give a damn. I know that there are TENS OF BILLIONS animals being tortured for food, and unless the world miraculously turns vegan overnight, there's no chance any of this will change. Change my view.  On the eating leftovers thing, I also have to add.. I've been to a wedding recently and I got vegetarian courses, it was really no hassle for anyone... but I looked at the courses with fish and meat and I just thought of all the stuff they'd be throwing away that day... if I ate meat and fish that day it would have made NO difference at all... maybe it would have been better, saved the cook some work...  For me the key point is not BUYING meat rather than not eating it, I get it, and having vegetarian stuff served that day and making things look positive for everyone and having conversations with others about being vegetarian was a positive thing... but the actual contribution to things? That restaurant probably threw away ten times what I could have eaten. It's depressing.  I still recommend that people switch to a vegetarian (or vegan) lifestyle, I think it's a GOOD thing by all means. It's a fantastic feeling, it's healthy, and a million other things. As I said I haven't stopped believing in the lifestyle and I'll never quit. I just believe the actual contribution to the environment and the well being of animals is insignificant, and expecting results is hopeless.  **I have found a convincing argument and I think that made me change my mind. Although many answers were backed up by very uplifting data, I couldn't justify changing my mind since I couldn't help but believe things are changing way too slowly, and that the damage might still be irreparable in the long run.**  &gt; Eventually — not soon, but maybe in a generation or two — I would not be surprised if the majority of people on the liberal side of the fence started to shun meat-eating, as has happened with social issues in recent years. And at that point, changes will be sweeping and sudden.  I have never thought about critical mass. I still believe the situation is a lot more complex than just the West, but even believing that one day a relatively sudden change could happen like it did with LGBT rights based on public opinion reaching critical mass makes me believe there's something to look for behind the hard numbers.  **Another great argument with links**  &gt; In short, the reality is: It adds up.

The growing number of people with vegetarian/vegan friends and family members also means that more people are being exposed to delicious vegetarian/vegan food and even learning how to cook it, all of which chips away at the all-too-common notion that any meal without meat isn&amp;#39;t worth eating.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Helping society at large reduce its meat consumption is really important because meat production has such an enormous environmental impact, especially with regard to climate change. The exact contribution of animal agriculture to climate change is disputed, but the most widely accepted statistics seem to put animal agriculture at about 15-25% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, with some estimates reaching as high as nearly 50%. While it certainly is possible to raise meat in a sustainable and environmentally healthy way, in practice 78% of beef, 95% of pork, and 99% of chicken is raised in factory farms, so getting people to eat less meat overall is very important. Even a 10% reduction in overall meat consumption could make a significant difference. According to the Earth Day Network, if everybody in the U.S. did not eat meat or cheese for just one day a week, it would be the equivalent of not driving 91 billion miles. (I&amp;#39;m not sure how that figure was calculated, but if it&amp;#39;s even close to correct, it demonstrates the kind of difference skipping meat just three meals a week could make.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the reality is: It adds up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Utilitarianism/Does%20Veganism%20Make%20a%20Difference.htm""&gt;Does Veganism Make a Difference?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/thresholds.pdf""&gt;Expected Utility, Contributory Causation, and Vegetarianism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Both of these essays approach your question in a statistics-based manner that focuses on thresholds.

CMV: Donald Trump would be a bad president,"Donald Trump is a decent businessman who inherited his capital. He's a punchline. A rich punchline, but a punchline all the same.  His views on immigration would not only alienate the countries south and north of the border, essentially saying they can't be trusted not to ""send"" their criminals here, but it would make us look paranoid to the rest of the world. People can come to the U.S. as tourists from several countries, not just Mexico, completely legally. They then can slip into the sea of people and stay, illegally. The problem with illegal immigration is much more complex than he seems to realize.  The man has no foreign policy experience. Boardroom deals with businessmen and bureaucrats from another country does not equate to nation-to-nation diplomacy.  His national defense ideas that I've heard seem to amount to, ""more guns and let's tell other countries to screw off.""  The Democrats' stance that the rich want to influence policy to get richer does not exclude Donald Trump. Who is to say he wouldn't endorse policies that would make it easier for both him and his kids to double their fortune?  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

CMV: Saggy pants are unacceptable but tolerated because of white guilt,"There should be nothing acceptable about walking around showing others your underwear. It is not civilized behavior, and it is potentially in violation of indecency laws (what about a man showing nothing but boxers with little girls walking nearby?), but it is not and will not be addressed because of the fear of being called racist.   My view: Saggy pants is not a cultural quirk, nor akin wearing your hat backward. it is offensive in a very real way, and should not be tolerated (in the sense that indecency laws were created for the same underlying reason)  Edit: so through a few comments in this thread, I've altered my view on this...   1. it has been correctly noted that many ethnic groups sag their pants  2. Offensive really is subjective, and I've realized the solution is a society I really don't want to live in (shira law for example)  3. there really are examples of dress that could be more offensive from that perspective","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve stopped seeing sagged pants the last couple of years, I assumed they had gone out of style.  But I admit that I might just not live in an area where it continues to be a fashion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sagged pants are (or were) probably just as popular, if not more, within the white community.  And even then, I would find it difficult to believe and impossible for you to argue that people who are racist towards minority cultures never sagged their pants as a fashion statement.  The whole &amp;quot;white guilt&amp;quot;, fear of being called a racist argument just doesn&amp;#39;t hold up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Could you better define in what &amp;quot;real way&amp;quot; saggy pants are offensive?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know where you live, but I think there are a lots of more revealing outfits that don&amp;#39;t qualify as public indecency.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just because some underwear is showing doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s public indecency.  &lt;a href=""http://cdn0.notonthehighstreet.com/system/product_images/images/000/668/859/original_blue-tatum-short-front2.jpg?1335442389""&gt;Look, her underwear is showing!&lt;/a&gt;  Most people consider this look perfectly acceptable, and I don&amp;#39;t think bra straps showing is more prevalent in one race.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Saggy pants typically aren&amp;#39;t considered professional, but they&amp;#39;re not necessarily uncivilized.

CMV: 'Triggers' aren't a real thing. We should all be able to overcome our issues and not project them unto other people.,"EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis)used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People who cry 'triggered' because something reminds them of a NON EXTREME incident or issue they are struggling with should not be sheltered or given the attention they are seeking.   EDIT 2: For some reason I feel that not everybody finished reading my post although theres a tl;dr and a very clear message that my views dont apply to extreme cases like in people who have PTSD yet Im getting all these (actually heartwrenching and very valid arguments) about people with PTSD whom my beef isnt with.  EDIT 3: All in all I think my anger towards modern day 'trigger happu tumblrinas' has somewhat subsided and Im beginning to understand that we cant scruitinise how everybody feels and that some people are stronger than others like one user said and that the effects of triggers on some people can be deadly.   Thank you all! :)  ----  In 7th and 8th grade I was a snob. This was probably because I am the youngest of five siblings and was fairly better looking than my classmates (before the acne, bad eyesight and crooked teeth kicked in) among other things.    I realised this because of the way my classmates talked about me and treated me and I took the summer of 8th grade to transform into somebody else. I do not recall how exactly I did it but I did. Everybody was surprised, myself included, that the transformation was permanent and genuine.  Sadly, I was no longer a bitch but a pushover instead. I was bullied shortly after and had a horrible 8 or so years until I graduated from university. During those 8 or so years, my first love died in a car crash, my parents had a terrible accident leaving my mother unable to walk for a year, of course I picked up smoking, I started to serial-date guys and their treatment to me kept getting progressively worse all while I tried to do well at university because it was getting too expensive for my parents to pay for and getting a job wasn't enough for me to sustain myself.  Add to the above a religious struggle between myself, my society and my own mother who didn't talk to me for three months while I lived in the same house as her because of my religious and romantic choices (I was dating a black guy), and you get a fairly broken person.  I didn't trust anyone, I was naive, nervous, insecure, a people pleaser, somewhat promiscuous and a smoker. I did things I never thought I'd do and was put in situations I never wanted to be placed in.   I was even ashamed of my own psychologist whom I never went back to visit after a couple of sessions because of how fucked up I was.  My issues seem trivial but these are just the things that I haven't blocked out. My view does apply to individuals who have gone through everything but EXTREME trauma.   My POINT is: How can I, and so many people who have gone through worse, emerge as functional if not even better people than we were because of what we went through by using our own logic and reasoning, the help of others, counselling and other resources, while others simply act as if life is supposed to be somehow tailored for them and that whatever 'triggers' them by making them actually have to THINK about what they went through should somehow be erased from their lives?   Tl;dr: Shit happens in life and people should wade through the pile of crap and come out as functional human beings via their own logic rather than project their issues unto others and claim that whatever 'triggers' them to think about their problems must somehow be banished or banned.     _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV: Any life other than one of poverty is unethical.,"Lets start by looking at a situation:  Imagine you are walking by a shallow river on your way to a ball when you see a child drowning. You're wearing some pretty expensive clothes (lets say 500 pounds) that will no doubt be ruined if you jump into the river. Saving this child doesn't put you in danger as you can stand in this river while the child being smaller cannot. Do you jump into that river to save that child?   Let's say you encounter that same river with a different child in it the next day while wearing your rolex watch. Do you jump into that river to save the child?   Now lets look at the real world. More than 1.3 billion people live in extreme poverty (less than 80p a day) and 7.6 million children are estimated to have died before their 5th birthday in 2010. Many of these are from poverty, preventable diseases and illnesses. Money can help provide infrastructure for schools, hospitals, sanitation facilities, vaccinations etc which no doubt will help reduce child mortality rates. Once you look at the world through this lens then it is easy enough to look at the world in terms of opportunity cost. This iphone or 100 life saving vaccinations. An expensive house or cheap government housing and a new well providing water for a village. One may argue that there is a difference between the example and this and that is distance. These children are much further away but I don't see how that dilutes your moral responsibility to them. Therefore, it seems that any money that you keep must be worth a child's life, education etc or be allocated to some other duty such as child rearing where you have a responsibility to give time and money (for schools, healthcare etc) to make sure that your child grows up to be a socially productive member of society. I know that sounds like a very cold perspective on what parenting is about but i couldn't think of another way to phrase it haha.  I will assume that most people think that you should save the child but this specifically is why I would save the child. I'm looking at this from the stance of virtue ethics (Aquinas) and I believe that by allowing this child to die shows a lack of charity and isn't positively building character. I can't justify losing a life in exchange for 500 pounds.  But,  I think even taken from the stance of consequentialism (believing that consequences should inform your moral thinking) or deontological ethics (believing that laws inform your moral stance) you would still reach the eventual conclusion that you must jump into that river:  Consequentialism (i.e. Utilitarianism): You would have to argue that having 500 pounds will lead to greater pleasure/happiness than that life and I don't think you can justify that.  Deontological ethics (i.e. Kant): I only really understand Kant so he's the one that I will briefly (very briefly) talk about but allowing that child to die breaks the categorical imperative as if you allowed that act to become universal you would be devaluing human life by saying that it has a price tag.  I've only briefly talked about why I think the child should be saved as I take it as a assumption that most people would save the child but I will be willing to discuss my ethical stance more thoroughly if anyone asks me about it but i didn't want my post to only appeal to those who have studied philosophy.

Virtue ethics demands that you are a charitable person, not that you perform maximally charitable actions. Under an Aristotelean framework (which is essentially what Aquinas operates under), it&amp;#39;s very easy to be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; charitable, as well, which I think is worth considering. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Regardless though, some common critiques of the view your espousing would be:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s impossible to accurately quantify &amp;#39;happiness&amp;#39; in such a way that would allow you to make the assumptions you&amp;#39;re making&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethics isn&amp;#39;t the highest thing we should aspire to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have unique ethical responsibilities to people who are closer to you (i.e. that space is morally relevant)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utilitarianism is heavily flawed, and your argument doesn&amp;#39;t really work for any other major school of ethics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This position contradicts common-sense morality, which is what all moral systems aspire to emulate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Do any of those sound like they could maybe change your view?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your argument is based on the notion that money can fix all of the problems that impoverished people face.

CMV: I don't think I should spend every waking hour of my teenage life trying to get into a good college,"I'm a really bad student, like a really bad student. In certain classes I simply do not do the homework and in all classes I rarely ever study. I understand perfectly where this will get me, but I am simply not willing to throw all my time and energy into things I see as unnecessary.   Don't get me wrong I'm not some party high schooler, quite the opposite really. I am an all honors student with many AP classes that I have been scheduled to take next year after taking one AP class this year (sophomore year). I don't waste my time with things I see as trivial and slowly school has turned into something I see as trivial. Instead of doing my school work I spend timing learning how to program or watching a documentary on issues in this world. I write, I read, and I just try to learn everything I can but just not at school. I feel like I need the freedom to choose what I do and when I do it and I am just not allowed this with school.  Every morning I wake up at 6:45 sit through painstakingly boring classes with rare highlights as there is just one or two classes I can somewhat enjoy. If there's a test it's a 50/50 that I'll turn it in half blank and if it's a lecture or some other activity I'll tune in only once awhile to get the gist of the lesson. I sometimes look around to my peers and see people with 4.0+ gpa's who are completely focused on school. I see them during free periods doing all the work assigned and I see them get mad when they get 2 points taken off. When I see this I can appreciate the effort, but at the end of the day there are literally thousands of other people just like them. Every school in the country has a couple valedictorians who will all be competing to get into the ""best"" colleges and a majority of them will not make it.  I think I understand the importance of college and I feel like I would excel at some of the top university, but as of now I not chasing that 4.0+ gpa required to get there and I don't see myself doing that anytime soon. I love to learn, I really love to learn and I teach myself new things I find interesting and useful everyday. That passion continues grow but it's pushing me away from going to the best colleges which I have been told will allow me to achieve the things I want to do. So please tell me why I should need to get that 4.0+ gpa and go to the best of the best of colleges. I want to help the world, but I'm not sure I'm going about it in the right way.  Edit: Thanks for all the advice guys. It's been very helpful and I'll be visiting this thread in the future when my determination will inevitably falter.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Especially at the high school level it is about learning how to learn. And that includes actual proper work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong. No one is saying you have to put 24/7 into your schoolwork to get good grades. Sure the valedictorian will probably be someone that did but that doesn&amp;#39;t matter. A lot of top universities are looking for more &amp;quot;rounded&amp;quot; students anyways. But there is a huge gap between going all out and putting in no work at all. Heck just do the minimum. Putting no work into your education means no one will put work into you and help you succeed. You think having good ap scores and such gets you into a good school by itself? Not without good recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s still time to change.

I saw people around me busting their ass for good grades, struggling with exams, participating in extra-curricular activities, all in efforts to get into a good university.  I could skate by in high school by doing the bare minimum, ace exams without studying, and after having my ego inflated by teachers over the years I simply felt I was better than everyone else.

They&amp;#39;re people who are not only smart, but driven in ways you couldn&amp;#39;t possibly fathom.  Successful people have motors.  They do what needs to get done, regardless of how they feel about the task.  There is no task that you are above - you&amp;#39;ve earned nothing thus far.  Regardless of what you decide to do in life, you&amp;#39;ll be met with tasks that seem menial and unnecessary.

"CMV: Illegal immigrants should be deported, and not be given amnesty in most circumstances","Let me start off by saying that I am not against legal immigration in anyway, and am only against illegal immigration. I believe that illegal immigrants should not be given amnesty for plenty of reasons.  A) They broke the law, and should be punished, not rewarded, for doing so. There are legal ways to immigrate into the US, and just because it is harder to do so does not mean you can ignore the law when it is convenient.   B) Illegal immigration depresses wages and lowers working conditions. They are willing to work for less, and are much less likely to complain when they are abused. Many businesses take advantage of such people to save costs, and treat their illegal immigrant workers unfairly.   C) The people coming in negatively effect the community by committing crime. According to USA Today, [they represent just 3.5% of the U.S. population, undocumented immigrants represented 7% of federal prison sentences following convictions on charges of sexual abuse, 9% of murders, 12% of assaults and 30% of kidnappings in 2013. ](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/16/voices-gomez-undocumented-immigrant-crime-san-francisco-shooting/30159479/)   **EDIT** I only googled ""how much crime to illegal immigrants commit"" and only looked at the first statistic I found in the article, so I do concede this point after reading my own source more clearly, since it states later in the article that ""There's no evidence that immigrants are either more or less likely to commit crimes than anyone else in the population,"" Janice Kephart, a CIS researcher, said last week on the PBS NewsHour.   D) Most importantly, by not having a tough stance on illegal immigration, it further encourages illegal immigration. There is always going to be motivation for illegal immigration, so as a country, we should do our best to discourage that behavior. By not actively discouraging illegal immigration, people would be stupid not to try to illegally immigrate.   **EDIT:** My view has changed in the sense that I no longer believe that all illegal immigrants should be deported as soon as possible, and you can see my post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3gt76g/cmv_illegal_immigrants_should_be_deported_and_not/cu1b3o9) _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

They work in certain jobs that traditional Americans don&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, no matter what laws we place, we will never defeat the massive amount of economic incentive for people to come over here. If Americans could make far, far, far more moving to Canada we would make the trip legal or not. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the fact that we have job sectors that require illegal work and they will simply come over anyway because of economic incentive, what we need is a much stronger guest worker program.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are people who would love to work the season an then go back to their home countries. Our current laws make this impossible. Once you&amp;#39;re here you stay. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If we had a solid guest worker program it would solve a fair amount of problems. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More laws are simply going to run into a lot of economic incentive.

Not only is it going to cost the US billions of dollars tracking down and deporting 11 million people, it leaves off the table other methods of punishment. Punishments that could include:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Paying a large fine to the taxpayers&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Community service&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Larger amount of paycheck going to payroll taxes (social security)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lower on the tier list for government job prospects&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Just deporting them all isn&amp;#39;t good for the country. Certainly not as good a deal as having them pay us money. This also doesn&amp;#39;t deal with the problem that most of the jobs they do Americans don&amp;#39;t wan to do anyway. And this:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are legal ways to immigrate into the US, and just because it is harder to do so does not mean you can ignore the law when it is convenient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I mean, come on. I hate calling people out but this is just textbook &amp;quot;American not realizing how good they have it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If a guy has a hungry family, he isn&amp;#39;t just breaking the law because it is &amp;quot;convenient.&amp;quot; He&amp;#39;s not shoplifting his favorite pair of sneakers. They are taking a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; risk coming here, and working a tremendous amount (I believe the average work week for an illegal immigrant is well over 50 hours..close to 60) in order to &lt;strong&gt;not starve.&lt;/strong&gt; Honestly, if I was in their position I would do the same thing. Do you really expect people to just say, &amp;quot;Oh, since it is against the law for me to climb that fence, me and my family are just gonna starve.&amp;quot; Fuck that. Sending them back because they &amp;quot;broke a law&amp;quot; is just flat out immoral. They had to be pretty desperate to take all those risks, uproot themselves from their homes, and move their whole family to a foreign country where they don&amp;#39;t even speak the language.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;B) Illegal immigration depresses wages and lowers working conditions.

However, it is silly to deport &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; illegals. Just deport the ones caught committing crimes.

CMV: It is more valuable for an English speaker to learn an East Asian language than any European language,"If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is more valuable than learning any European language.   -Travel  It's easier for Europeans to learn English and harder for East Asians to learn English. Most Europeans at the very least speak basic English, and most East Asians only know English words. You can travel across Europe only knowing English, but in East Asia it helps more to know the language. I don’t consider places like South America and China to be developed enough to travel through, other than tourist spots catering to English speakers.   -Media  When it comes to media, East Asian countries have their own isolated worlds. Going through their music, films, television and books can almost feel like visiting an alien world since so little reaches the west.  Specifically Japan and South Korea are economic powerhouses and understand the importance of [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power), and as a means produce a lot more films, music, games, comics, literature and TV than any European or South American country.   -Availability  European languages have more speakers than East Asian languages, but most Europeans already speak English.  For an American there may be a lot Latin American immigrants, but there are Asian immigrants everywhere in the world.  East Asian languages might not be as widely available, but their populations are educated, travel a lot, and have [more native speakers than other European languages.](http://i.imgur.com/SDrGTr8.jpg)   -Difficulty  East Asian languages are said to be notoriously hard by Europeans, but with technology in just the recent years it has become a lot easier. Chinese characters, hangul and Japanese writing systems can now be learned on your smartphone by playing games with apps like memrise or anki.  A lot of European-language speakers complain about how complex European grammar tends to be, whereas East Asian grammar often is “logical” and straight to the point (with exceptions, as any language).  If you disclude writing systems, East Asian languages would be easier to learn as a spoken language than European ones for someone who has experience with neither.   -Cultural benefits  It’s almost as if their worlds are isolated from ours. Learning a widely different language helps us understand the structures of our own languages. Learning about a completely different culture helps us understand the uniqueness of our own culture.   European cultures are often so similar that we only tend to think of simple things as being differentiating between countries, but what makes us unique as westerners becomes much more apparent when compared to a country at the other side of the world.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There is value in learning a language that you can use, there is less value in learning a language that you won&amp;#39;t use. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the case of an European, (I&amp;#39;m taking the Dutch as an example)  Germany is our biggest trading partner, there is value in learning German for economic reasons. Germany is bordering to us, increasing the amount of times we meet, there is value in learning German for social reasons, like vacations or friendships. which isn&amp;#39;t there for Asian languages, because the people aren&amp;#39;t vacationing that often in Asian countries as they do in our neighbouring countries. People that we meet in Europe often can speak an european language, even the ones that have origins in Asia, so it is easier to just keep to learning European languages if you are planning to stay inside of Europe. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to learn a new language is immersion. It is easier to do so in Europe as an European. We have English, French and German as language options on TV for example. And if TV isn&amp;#39;t enough we can just travel a few hours and go to a country where the language is spoken. While there is barely any chance to immerse yourself in Asian languages the same way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the small problem. it is far easier for a Chinese person to learn fluent English than a western to learn any level of fluent Chinese. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When those two meet, guess what the language will be?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;English. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really advocate that it is better to learn Spanish than Mandarin, but I would say that there are a lot of people in China who know a little bit of Mandarin that are getting out compete by Chinese who speak English a lot better than westerns speak Mandarin. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: I use iTunes. Why should I switch to something like Spotify when I already have an extensive library set up?,"Some of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 1000 songs in our library. Not to mention, iTunes is the only thing that will properly communicate with my Apple product that I use for music.  I realize you can download pretty much as much music as you want, but to get that, you have to pay. Whereas iTunes is free. I'm not really the type of person who's into discovering brand new music all the time. Occasionally, I'll expand my horizons until I find an artist who really sticks, and then I'll play the crap out of their music until I'm pretty much sick of it. Back in the day, when I had a Zune to play music, they had a similar feature where you could pay a fixed subscription fee to download as much music as you wanted for free. Even back then, an offer like this didn't pique my interest.  Knowing this, are there any standout features that evolve the listening experience so much that I'd be willing to abandon my iTunes library and start over again?  Edit: I've decided that I want to experiment with Spotify and at least try it out. Thank you to all the people who replied. You all gave really helpful information. Also, a side note, this is one of my very first posts and, by miles, my most commented on one. So thank you for the good conversation as well. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost analysis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lets say over the next 2-3 years you plan on buying 500 new songs. If you are buying them as singles, that could easily be $500 as ($1 a song).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Spotify (free version) would already be an upside. Now lets say you want to play your music when you are not at home, and do not have your devices with you. You could use any computer and log on to your playlist and songs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Then conveniece, you are driving to work and you hear that dope ass song, it is new and you dont have it. you dont need to think about buying it, or if its worth it. You automatically have access to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a former iTunes user, I know how you&amp;#39;re feeling - I had a library of thousands of songs that I no longer use. I think it all boils down to a cost-benefit analysis, and how quickly you like to add music to your library.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Using iTunes is free, but you have to pay about a dollar, give or take, for each song (less per song if you purchase an album). With Spotify Premium, you pay $5 per month for unlimited songs. So, if you regularly add more than five songs a month (which I do) then Spotify is definitely worth the fee. The crux of this issue is that it doesn&amp;#39;t matter how many songs you &lt;em&gt;already have in your library&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;how often you add new ones&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;#39;d be remiss if I didn&amp;#39;t point out that Spotify has a free version (if you can stomach the drawbacks) which offers most of the same benefits. Theoretically unlimited music library for free - hard to beat that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: Statistics should be a mandatory part of the high school curriculum, but NOT as a replacement for any standard mathematics courses.","Increasingly, many argue that elementary statistics should be a mandatory subject in the high school curriculum.  I agree with this wholeheartedly, as the discipline has become central to civic and economic literacy in the 21st century.  But to argue, as some have, that this should *replace* the traditional ""algebra to calculus"" high school math sequence makes about as much sense to me as arguing that history should replace English.  While the two undoubtedly share some skills and mechanics, they are fundamentally different disciplines with fundamentally different roles in the curriculum, and both are necessary for a complete education.   Although the underlying mechanics of statistics are undoubtedly mathematical, increasingly it is becoming recognized as a discipline in its own right, with its own methodology and best practices distinct from those of pure mathematics, and the structure of high school should reflect this divergence.  At the high school level, the focus of statistics pedagogy should be on core concepts, the appropriate use of technology, and interpretation-- you are teaching a student to turn data into an accurate, precise probablistic statement, and to have an intuitive understanding of the probability concepts underlying the meaning of that statement.  These are important skills, but they aren't really *mathematical* skills in the traditional sense; you are reasoning in a different mode.     In a well-taught algebra, geometry, or calculus class, by contrast, students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively, learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence, solve non-routine problems, and use mathematics of all types to analyze real-world phenomena.  None of these skills except arguably the last play any role in an elementary statistics curriculum.     You can argue that a deep facility with ""abstract"" math has little importance in the ""real world,"" but increasingly the 21st century economy *does* reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem-solving, even if you are never directly using specific skills (the classic ""when will I ever need the quadratic formula in real life"" bugbear).  Finally, learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields, which statistics training will not replace.  Thus, BOTH statistics and math, as separate disciplines, should have a role in the high school curriculum.   As a final note, I should mention that I am here presupposing that both statistics and pure math can are taught *well.*  Obviously, a well-taught statistics class is much more useful than a poorly-taught math class, and vice-versa.  I'm well aware that bad mathematics teaching (and bad statistics teaching, for that matter) is rampant in the U.S., so I'd prefer to keep the horror stories along those lines out of this particular discussion and stay focused on the best-case possibilities of both subjects.   **EDIT:** Thank you to those of you who have been willing to engage me on the substantive pedagogical questions.  I have re-thought my initial claim and now concede that there are alternatives to the traditional algebra sequence when it comes to teaching abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills.  I still stand by my argument that statistics fundamentally stands apart from math, and should probably be seen as a separate subject with some connections to math (akin to physics or computer science) rather than as an optional class within the math department.  But there are alternatives to the algebra-geometry-trig-calculus sequence that might better reinforce the connections between statistics and math while still accomplishing all the important educational goals.   **To those of you more interested in debating the logistical nuts and bolts (concerns about burdensome mandates on schools, etc.):** thank you also for your participation in the conversation.  Some have made arguments that all state mandates on school curriculum are unnecessarily burdensome or will cost too much; I believe this premise has empirically denied, so these arguments are not convincing to me.  Others have made the point that, in the event that states are unwilling to add new credit hours to their diploma requirements, we risk adding statistics at the expense of electives or core courses.  This is a more compelling argument, but ultimately a risk I am willing to take, since I believe that in most if not all states there is room in the existing credit structure to responsibly add statistics in place of at least one course.  As a separate issue, I think increasing credit hour minimums and extended school days are serious proposals that should be given consideration as possibilities, though it is not my intent to make a full argument in favor of them here.  Unless you have something substantially different to offer than the above two arguments, I doubt I will be convinced by further discussion along these lines.

Many would disagree with that. Calculus and the classes leading up to it are a notoriously horrible representation of pure mathematics and, while I don&amp;#39;t really have a great argument against putting statistics into standard high school educations (apart from the lack-of-resources argument others have mentioned), I can at least argue that, whether or not statistics is thrown in, calculus should probably be thrown out.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just going to preemptively say, though - Lockhart did a much better job articulating it than I can in his short paper &lt;a href=""https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf""&gt;A Mathematician&amp;#39;s Lament&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#39;t mean to pass the debating on to someone else, but if you&amp;#39;ve got time I&amp;#39;d really recommend reading it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The main point is that calculus and the courses leading up to it are far too rooted in applications - they&amp;#39;re treated as though they&amp;#39;re going to be useful to students later in life, because in the minds of administrators, that&amp;#39;s how putting them in the curriculum is justified. Because of that, teachers and students alike end up perpetuating the myth that math is, at its core, supposed to be useful and applicable. That&amp;#39;s entirely the wrong idea, though. There is math that&amp;#39;s useful, but applications aren&amp;#39;t the reason we practice math, nor the reason we&amp;#39;re interested in it. The real value of math is that it&amp;#39;s beautiful, interesting, and most of all personally enriching. It helps develop important parts of our minds, from articulating ideas to critical thinking to problem solving. Calculus is the centerpiece of the high school math education not because it&amp;#39;s beautiful or enriching but because it&amp;#39;s perceived to be useful, and that&amp;#39;s harmful to students (who, generally speaking, waste time learning it without ever using it) and to the general population (who, generally speaking, regard math as a tedious object to be wielded only for the purposes of science).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, if the people creating high school curricula wanted to put in a &amp;quot;math&amp;quot; class that&amp;#39;s actually useful, statistics would be a much better choice, I&amp;#39;m sure. I believe many more people would find themselves being able to apply it to their daily lives. I would hope the world doesn&amp;#39;t forget what math actually is, though, and I would hope that, whether statistics is added or not, calculus is either replaced (by something that&amp;#39;s actually done for its own value) or dropped entirely. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3eqdj5/cmv_a_statistics_course_should_be_required_as/""&gt;related thread&lt;/a&gt; about a month back. I think &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3eqdj5/cmv_a_statistics_course_should_be_required_as/cthkp5o""&gt;what I said then&lt;/a&gt; applies here: if we have to chose, discrete math is more valuable than statistics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is mostly going to be an argument that discrete math should replace something in the calculus-track curriculum. However, many introductory discrete math courses spend a fair amount of time covering statistics, and I think that&amp;#39;s very valuable for many of the same reasons you&amp;#39;ve covered. I think that discrete math courses typically paint a very coherent story up to statistics -- much more so than jumping straight into statistics. You talk about deductive reasoning, set theory, combinatorics, and probability before getting to statistics. I think learning and understanding all of those things helps frame statistics in a more intuitive way. For example, Bayes&amp;#39; Theorem (which is, in my experience, a topic in most introductory statistics courses) is much better understood with a firm understanding of deductive reasoning, set theory, and probability.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You say this about calculus-track curricula: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a well-taught algebra, geometry, or calculus class, by contrast, students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively, learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence, solve non-routine problems, and use mathematics of all types to analyze real-world phenomena.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I fervently agree that learning to reason deductively is important. Wouldn&amp;#39;t you say that a better way to learn deductive reasoning is to teach it directly? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can argue that a deep facility with &amp;quot;abstract&amp;quot; math has little importance in the &amp;quot;real world,&amp;quot; but increasingly the 21st century economy does reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem-solving, even if you are never directly using specific skills (the classic &amp;quot;when will I ever need the quadratic formula in real life&amp;quot; bugbear). Finally, learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields, which statistics training will not replace. Thus, BOTH statistics and math, as separate disciplines, should have a role in the high school curriculum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Again -- totally agree abstract reasoning is important. I just don&amp;#39;t think calculus or algebra are the best topics to teach this skill to the average student. Too often they devolve into rote application of formula or theorems that have no meaning to the student. Teaching deductive reasoning directly generally doesn&amp;#39;t suffer from this problem, because the theorems that do exist are incredibly intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In closing, I&amp;#39;d propose that a better change to high school math curriculum would be:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;For the general population, teach discrete math instead of (pre-)calculus. Topics should include deductive reasoning, set theory, probability, and statistics.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;For more advanced students, offer followup courses in both statistics and calculus.  (I guess this is probably already the case at most good schools).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: There is no media ""agenda"", just average people reporting on what sells.","I see a lot of people talk about the media like it's a living organism. They accuse ""the media"" of purposefully hiding information (often powerful corporations/government secrets, or what have you), and the like.  These are just every day employees. Average reporters/office workers just trying to churn out another day for a paycheque, just like the rest of us. They're no more intelligent (or dumber) than the rest of us, and they don't have an agenda.  They're just trying to find stories that their editor will approve; Their editor is just looking for stories that will be read; Advertisers are paying for highly consumed media.  That's it.

It may seem like media&amp;#39;s job is to produce stories, but the media&amp;#39;s real job is to produce an audience for advertisements.  That is how the media gets paid.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So the media&amp;#39;s real customer isn&amp;#39;t you, it&amp;#39;s corporations that buy air time for advertisements.  And this gives those corporations a huge amount of control, because if the corporation doesn&amp;#39;t like what the media is doing, it will pull its ads, and the media company won&amp;#39;t get paid for that content.  Thus the media companies pretty much have to do what the advertisers tell them.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, whether or not the $36K per year reporter has an agenda doesn&amp;#39;t even factor into all of this.  The corporations don&amp;#39;t deal with the reporters, they deal with the people making multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars, who control the media company&amp;#39;s editorial policy.  They are the ones who tell the editors and reporters what do do, and they are way more concerned about selling advertising time than protecting the careers of $36K per year reporters.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Of course, the purpose of these advertisements is to get people to spend money on products and services.  So the corporations that make these advertisements want to make sure that the government does things that are favorable to them -- tax breaks, military procurement, protection from imports, food and drug approval -- to help them sell these products and services.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So now these corporations have to convince the government to do those things.  And they do this through campaign contributions and by ensuring that the politicians who support them get favorable coverage in the media.  This keeps the politicians happy and keeps them in office, and in return the politicians help out the corporations.  One hand washes the other.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, in short, it&amp;#39;s a cycle.  Politicians give favors to businesses; businesses give money to the media; media gives support to politicians.  And around it goes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think there is some single entity controlling all media like some Orwellian dystopia, but I think we have a lot of evidence of journalists of similar political leanings discussing and colluding about stories in ways that would qualify as pushing an agenda.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Take the &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JournoList""&gt;JournoList scandal&lt;/a&gt;, where Ezra Klein of the Washington Post basically ran a private forum of hundreds of journalists who discussed and agreed upon talking points to support President Obama during his initial campaign and later into his presidency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: I am a circumcised male. I see no issues with the procedure and would circumcise my child if he were born in the U.S. today.,"First off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised.  Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, in the exact same way that pain associated with other surgical procedures I have had under general anesthesia as an adult does not exist because I cannot remember it.  The WHO currently recommends male circumcision for HIV prevention and ""as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package"".  It is primarily recommended in areas with high incidences of HIV, but given its demonstrated effect at reducing the spread of the virus I prefer to have any added protection possibly available.  I would plan to infer the same protection to any hypothetical children born at this time, especially considering that the complication rates here are significantly lower than in the areas where it is most strongly recommended by the WHO.  Living in the midwest U.S. it is culturally nearly expected, with 70-80% prevalence.  Because of this, many to most potential sexual partners in my area (including myself, as a gay male) prefer the aesthetic of a circumcised penis.  With the research consensus demonstrating no adverse effects on sexual performance, I see no reason to not stick with the cultural norm.   What may help change my view:  * *Scientific studies* demonstrating prolonged psychological damage due to infant male circumcision.  * *Scientific studies* demonstrating that complication rates and severity in the U.S. outweigh potential benefits due to HIV resistance.  * *Scientific* evidence that circumcised males in the U.S. are demonstrably less satisfied with their sex lives than uncircumcised males.  What will *not* help change my view:  * ""People should be allowed to chose"".  Parents are wholly responsible for their children's health and well-being until they are capable of making those decisions on their own.  Circumcision complication rates increase dramatically with age.  * ""If everyone stopped doing it, it wouldn't be culturally expected anymore."" Yeah, not going to happen any time soon.

"CMV:As a society, we should not use public resources to cure or treat children with chronic illnesses.","* As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.   * Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic. * Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now.  * I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the ""warm glow"" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used.  * Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture. Because of climate change, and the overuse of farmlands we may reach that point in the near future.

It fails to take into account a number of things. Firstly, there is another definition of &amp;#39;utility&amp;#39; - the maximisation of pleasure. Letting sick children die is an exercise in cold pragmatism, and not an action (or consequence of deliberate inaction, more specifically) that anyone would relish or enjoy. There is undeniable value in allowing and encouraging a society to feel good about itself, and failure to take that into account would result in a society that has less esteem in itself, and therefore a society that functions less efficiently, and is more likely to descend into dysfunction. Indeed, Jeremy Bentham, considered the founder of modern utilitarianism, said that, &amp;quot;it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong&amp;quot;. And while your suggestions would probably provide a small economic boost, this does not make up for the inevitable loss of happiness that such actions would cause.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To look outside of utilitarian philosophy, I would also hold that your suggestion runs contrary to the entire point of government, which is look after its citizens, to safeguard their lives and livelihoods. A government should - and most, thankfully, do, to at least some extent - look after the needs of its most vulnerable citizens, &lt;em&gt;regardless of whether or not this is of any economic benefit&lt;/em&gt;. Taking a ruthlessly pragmatic approach to the lives and well-being of the citizens in their care is not the mark of a functional government trying to foster a stable society, but of a government trying to trim society down to its bare, self-sustainable bones - in other words, not a government trying to its best for the people, but a government trying to make itself obsolete in one of the most brutal ways possible. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for your Malthusian argument, I think the number of sick children being kept alive in the ways you describe is low enough to have a negligible effect on the total human population. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: It's irrational to keep a gun in your home for self-defense,"*[This article](https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/12/health-risk-having-gun-home) does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/defensive-gun-ownership-gary-kleck-response-115082.html#.Vdm1n_lVhBc) that lays out some criticisms of the first article's source study, along with a rebuttal from another journalist who's written on the topic.*  I believe that:  1. You, or someone in your family, are more likely to be killed by your gun either purposefully or accidentally than you are to use the gun against an attacker successfully in self-defense.  2. Therefore, if your goal is to make yourself and/or your family safer, then choosing to keep a gun in your home explicitly for that purpose is an irrational decision.   I do believe there is one exception to this. If you have a particular reason or belief that you are likely to be attacked, then, since the odds of being attacked have increased dramatically, then it may be rational to have a gun in the house for self-defense. For example, if you have a stalker. If you have received threats on your life. If you have any reasonable belief that someone will try to harm you specifically. If government or police forces have broken down. Basically, if the odds change so that for you the risk of you or your family being attacked is greater than the risk of having a gun in the house, then it would be rational to have a gun.  But we do know, statistically, on average, that is not the case. So for the average person, the risks are such that the rational decision for maximizing safety is to not keep a gun.  I further believe that if you get other uses out of the gun other than just self-defense, then the other added benefits of having a gun would make it rational to keep one in the house. For example, if somebody was a hunter and or target shooter and they get a lot of joy out of their hobby, that could be worth the risk of gun ownership. Or even if someone cited tradition, or the need of an armed populace as a check on the government, that too could be a perceived benefit to them that makes the safety risk worthwhile. I'm strictly speaking about what's the best decision for maximizing personal and family safety.  Change my view by showing me that the risk of harm to you or your family is lower by having a fire arm in the house.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

CMV: There is no good reason for the average person to ever buy a new car,"I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a car guy, so it's entirely possible I'm overlooking something major, but given how fast cars depreciate in value, buying a new one seems like a really dumb move to me. Whatever features you are looking for in a car, you can get better features for the same or a lower price in a used car. Like, say you have $25,000 to spend on a car. You could get a nice new Toyota, or you could get a fully loaded Lexus that's less than a year old and has features that are superior in every measurable way to the new Toyota. Seems like a no-brainer to me which one I'd buy. So basically, aside from people for whom money is truly no object and I suppose people with pathological fears of sitting where others have sat, I just can't imagine any good reason for the average Joe with a limited budget and no debilitating phobias to buy a new car.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

"CMV: In light of the recent Supreme Court ruling, the most logical extension of this policy is the eventual legalization of Polygamy and other non-standard marriage arrangements, which will have a negative effect on society as a whole due to the difficulty of defining ""marriage"" or a ""family"".","To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to apply to everyone in society. I am, however, mildly concerned or at least intrigued as to where this debate or issue ends.  The reason it's troubling for me is that the most common arguments used to support gay marriage are that ""love is love"" and ""loving who you choose is your right"". What these arguments implicitly say is that the necessary criteria to be allowed to marry is that you love that which you are marrying.  Now I won't delve into the typical response of ""Next thing you know, it'll be legal to marry your pets!"" because I find that particularly hyperbolic and non-productive to the discussion. But I do feel that this open mindset of the definition of marriage will definitely lead to a future debate about what ""marriage"" is.  I believe that the next group to demand legal marriage rights will be polygamists, and that the same arguments of ""love is love"" will still apply. My fear is that despite this good ruling today, we have opened up the door to extremely loose and liberal interpretations of the meaning of ""marriage"" to include anything we want it to under the law.  ~~Further, I believe that polygamy is harmful to society and that raising children in a polygamous is harmful to their growth. I believe that polygamy is not a natural arrangement for humans, and that no matter what, it will be emotionally damaging to at least one person in this ""relationship""~~.  But then as I type those words, I realize that the exact same things were said about gay marriage in recent history. So, Reddit, CMV that this supreme court ruling isn't going to evolve into a culture of people being able to marry whoever (or whatever) or however many people they want.  Edit: Let's avoid the moral implications of Polygamy for now. I shouldn't have typed out my personal views on the matter because it's really not what I'm interested in arguing (whether it's right or wrong). I'm interested in hearing legally, why this SC ruling will not lead to a case law precedent used to affirm Polygamy rights in the future. I ask this because all through this debate, most advocates for gay marriage rights said that comparisons of the movement to polygamy were ridiculous. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Even if polyamorous individuals want their three, four, or five-person relationships acknowledged under the law, there&amp;#39;s more obstacles than just legal recognition—the first obstacle, and probably the biggest obstacle to polyamorous relationships in the first place, is negotiating the terms of the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Marriage is a lot of pair-exclusive privileges, rights, commitments, and responsibilities. Larger benefits from certain benefits programs if married. Sponsorship of a spouse for immigration purposes. Parenting rights. Treating held property as shared. Declaring next-of-kin for survivor benefits, emergency medical decisions, and wrongful death lawsuits. Spousal Privilege. Child support. And the list goes on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Each one of those needs to be worked out in a polyamorous relationship, determined individually and often contentiously in the long-term. Unless, of course, the polyamorous relationship is using the relatively common model of &amp;quot;a primary-partnership pair, alongside other groups of primary-partnership pairings and individuals, existing within a family-like community,&amp;quot; in which case marriage as it exists post-Obergefell v. Hodges is sufficient to assign those rights and privileges effectively—effectively, sufficient to recognize their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Simply put, there&amp;#39;s not going to be a push for legalization of polygamy because there&amp;#39;s not enough of an agreement on what polygamy is. It&amp;#39;s either too different from marriage for enough people to agree on it as a one-size-fits-all institution, or too similar to marriage (and accessible enough to the individuals in question) that there&amp;#39;s no need to ask for a change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At most, there might be a push to allow for assignment of those rights and privileges to different people under contract law. But even that seems relatively unlikely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been very intrigued by the &amp;#39;slippery slope&amp;#39; argument.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While I personally am not interested in polygamy, what&amp;#39;s wrong with it? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s natural for humans to live in groups. &amp;#39;Tribes&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;family&amp;#39; whatever you would like to call it. I don&amp;#39;t see anything wrong with families that have several adults to act as role models for children. I just can&amp;#39;t see why it would be detrimental to children to be raised in that environment. Isn&amp;#39;t this more of an assumption you&amp;#39;re making rather than being based on any sort of evidence?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For your argument being that it would be emotionally damaging. What sort of life would you lead if you didn&amp;#39;t get hurt emotionally at some point? These people are consenting adults, they can make their own decisions. As long as there isn&amp;#39;t a sex bias (e.g. men can have many wives but not the other way around), then I think that people can make their own decision about whether a polygamous relationship is something they want. People get hurt and taken advantage of anyway in this society where only 2 person marriage is legal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The main argument that I ponder going against it is that marriage does afford certain legal privileges. But in thinking about it, if these can be already be taken advantage of in a two person marriage (e.g. marrying for a visa) would polygamy really make it more of a problem? I don&amp;#39;t really think it would. The same difficulties that are present now would still be present.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really interested to know if you have any good arguments against polygamy other than the fact that you are not interested in it personally. I think a lot of arguments against it are based on assumptions people make because they personally don&amp;#39;t want to be in that kind of relationship, rather than being based on anything solid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: In software development; and in other fields involving extended thought-work that depends on focus and concentration; there is no value in having coworkers to interact with face to face - and in fact, distractions created that way are counter-productive","I believe this comic expresses the argument most cogently:  http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/  Now, to my wall of text:  I run a small software company that's reasonably successful. I've been doing this for the past 15 years.  I've been employing people for years that I have never met — and quite possibly never will meet.  Last time I met any of my developers face to face was maybe 6 years ago.  I perceive no value whatsoever in meeting face to face. None.  Working together in an office is an impediment to getting work done, and is a source of constant interruption.  Email is generally better for productivity than face to face contact, or instant messaging.  Both face to face contact, and instant messaging, are distractions, and are useful primarily in the situation that you cannot progress on anything without immediate input. Such situations are extraordinary.  The people I meet face to face in my life are my wife, my son, and our nanny. I don't have a social need for more.  I believe people who think they need face to face contact for work in software development are either confusing social needs with work — or possibly, I would fear, aren't competent to work on their own. Or maybe they're involved in some kind of work that involves extraordinary synchronization — the kind of which I do not know.  If someone can't work independently, and must constantly interrupt other developers, I would consider them a burden, rather than an asset. To be an asset, one must be able to get work done on one's own, and coordinate as necessary.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that, if you're not going to physically touch the other person, there is nothing you can do in a face to face meeting that you cannot do online.  There's literally no reason to meet unless you're going to kiss, or have sex, or give a person a massage.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, the coding part of software development requires focus.  Sure.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But good engineers care deeply about the product - they fight for things they care about, they tend to help define and drive features.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tell me then, how do you come to consensus &amp;amp; divide work with purely asymmetrical communication? How do you motivate remote employees?  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More often than not, remote shops have very poor answers to those questions, and as a result what they have are a number of a remote employees or contractors that just kind of mail it in.  It might be profitable if you have a good business model and do custom/enterprise software, but it&amp;#39;s hard to build &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; product that way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, some companies have figured out how to do distributed correctly... but it&amp;#39;s a very hard culture to build and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious as to how you do it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a bit of a weird example, but Naughty Dog and Insomniac Games used to work in the same Universal Studios backlot. They pretty much worked in the same cubicles. The games they created, like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon, were better games because of the constant chatting between members of the two companies. Each of the two examined the other company&amp;#39;s software and saw amazing new features they could add to themselves. It was a source of friendly competition, and everyone was involved. The softwares the two companies created proved to be some of the most top-selling and highly regarded Playstation titles at the time. None of this innovation would have happened if the employees of both worked online without physical contact with each other. Doesn&amp;#39;t this show that sometimes, physical environments do help to make a better software in the first place?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: I think it's a selfish motive to purposely try to have children.,"I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, once you've had the kids it's selfless because of how much you have to give up for them. But the initial desire to birth them in the first place is selfish. I want my own children because I want to carry on my own genes. I want to have a little human that resembles me.  As a woman, I want to experience the feeling of a baby inside of me. These reasons are the main reasons why people choose to birth their own kids.  Here's a few reasons why I find it selfish.  1. There are plenty of children out there without parents. Over 150 million orphans, not to mention foster children. Then here are people who are trying to birth their own when there are so many helpless children without a loving home.  2. There are over 800 million people starving in the world. People are dying from hunger and you're trying to bring another mouth that needs feeding into the world.  3. This reason may be a little unexpected but it's something I'm personally afraid of and so I feel it's a valid reason. I'm agnostic. You can believe whatever you want about the afterlife but that doesn't mean you actually know what will happen to us after we die. Whether we go to a heaven, a hell, are reincarnated, cease to exist or whatever else people can come up with. You just can't  know for sure and anyone who says differently is lying to themselves. Now that being said, say hell is a reality. I hope it isn't but you never know. What if you birthed these children out of your selfish desire and they did just whatever it took to have themselves sent to hell forever. Even if you did pick the ""right"" religion doesn't mean that your child is going to believe it.    Honestly, I would love for someone to change my mind. My ex and I broke up over this because I want to adopt children and he wants biological children. I just can't morally justify purposely bringing children in the world.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

It is innate in our biological make up to want to have children and raise them.   If everyone felt like you did, we&amp;#39;d have an opposite problem. In fact, Japan does have that problem and the US could be not too far behind them some believe.   While true plenty of children could use a good home, that doesn&amp;#39;t take away the biological desire to have your own children and the good that can come of having your own.    I can&amp;#39;t see why you can&amp;#39;t do both. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not so sure hunger is an over population problem as much as a logistics or greed problem.   We have plenty of food to feed everyone in the world now, we just don&amp;#39;t distribute it correctly.   You sound like a smart person, we could use smart genes being passed down into the pool.  That is a helpful thing to society.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your last point is a strange one indeed.  I&amp;#39;m atheist, not agnostic, but we&amp;#39;ll leave that argument for another time and place.   However, being as I am, I can really address your beliefs on that point as they&amp;#39;re not mine, so I&amp;#39;d just leave it to say that&amp;#39;s a really remote thing to concern yourself with over wanting to have kids.   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I love my kid.   Not only does he look like me but he acts like me too, its evident even though he&amp;#39;s only 3.  I think the bond we&amp;#39;ll have when he&amp;#39;s older is far stronger than anything I could achieve if I adopted a kid, who I could love equally, but I&amp;#39;m not sure the same bond would exist.    Evolution has spent a long time perfecting things and there&amp;#39;s a reason you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to have a child, and why that child acts and looks like you.   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economically and socially, not having children when you have the means to raise them is a far more selfish act.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;#39;s focus the discussion on the US, since that is where I assume you live.  After all, most of those 150 million orphans cannot be easily or legally adopted into the US, and those 800 million starving people is not because we lack food (we have a major surplus), it is about logistics and failed political states.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyways, in the US, there were only 101,666 children legally up for adoption in 2012, and of them 52,039 children were adopted. &lt;a href=""http://www.ccainstitute.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=category&amp;amp;layout=blog&amp;amp;id=25&amp;amp;Itemid=43""&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That contrasts the ~3.9 million babies born each year. &lt;a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm""&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other words, the majority children in the US who can be adopted &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; adopted, and even if all of them were, it would not cover even 2.5% of the births that happen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that even with all those births, the US doesn&amp;#39;t meet its replacement rate.  That means that our population would be declining if not for massive amount of immigrants we take in.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, why is this important?  Because our economic and especially our social systems depend on new productive workers to enter the workforce as old ones retire.  Without them, the economy would collapse, social programs would go bankrupt, and we would basically experience a long depression until our population rates stabilized or increased.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now why is it selfish?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, while society bares &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the cost of creating these new workers through free public education, the vast majority of the money and time used to produce them comes from the parents of the child.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other words, the parents are sacrificing their own resources to produce something that all of society needs.  This is the opposite of selfish.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, a person who doesn&amp;#39;t have children and retires is instead reaping the advantages of having those new workers work in factories and pay taxes for things like social security benefits and firefighters without having to contribute to making new workers themselves.  From a societal perspective, that is much more selfish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: There is nothing morally wrong with police revenue raising.,"When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether they are doing it to decrease chances of accidents or they are revenue raising, the power still lies completely in the hand of the person behind the wheel.  Even if the police had the intention of revenue raising, that money still goes toward hiring more officers, putting more police cars on the road and getting better technology to combat road accidents. They aren't making anyone speed, they are just making the best of the fact that people are going to speed, so they might as well bring some revenue in from it.  Edit: I should have clarified that I am referring exclusively to traffic offences eg. Speeding, drink driving etc.  Edit: My view has been changed.  I now see that the motivations behind revenue raising contradict the motivations that the police service is created to have. If revenue raising was the goal, the Police service would not only be out for the wrong reasons, but the entire outcome of what they would achieve would be counterproductive to society as a whole. Due to this, revenue raising cannot be seen as morally sound.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conflict of interest. The purpose of the police, in almost every area, is to protect and serve, not to protect, serve, and raise money. If police are getting more money from giving tickets to speeders than doing other duties, such as monitoring for phone usage in school zones or providing a presence in a neighborhood as a deterrent or pursuing other, more dangerous offenders, that&amp;#39;s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I, personally, would much prefer my local police force to prioritize danger, and not have to worry that they&amp;#39;ll be busy doing the easy jobs or the cash-grabbing jobs when they should be protecting and serving. I don&amp;#39;t want my local police worrying about anything that isn&amp;#39;t keeping the public safe and being fair in that enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s the issue of discrimination. Will cops see a shitty, cheap car speeding and ignore it because they think the driver can&amp;#39;t pay up, but pursue all the luxury cars and give them every conceivable charge in the interest of milking them? I mean, I&amp;#39;m less offended by the idea of discriminating against rich people than most other groups, but, again, if the cops are going after the money instead of the danger, I think that&amp;#39;s a big problem for my safety as a citizen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police often go after out of town drivers because they can make more money off of them (for various reasons). If a cop is ordered to bust out of town plates before in-town plates, it is reasonable to assume that he will pull over a foreigner going 67 before a resident going 70 (in a 60 speed limit) right next to each other. What if the driver going 70 kills someone right after? Would you hold the police force responsible for this? Technically they pulled over a safer driver for an opportunity to make more money. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Think about how much this kind of behavior could hurt society: In business we call optimizing our resources to make the most money in certain areas &lt;em&gt;targeting&lt;/em&gt;. This is a kind of discrimination, but because businesses do not have a moral or legal obligation to market their services to the whole population, there is nothing wrong with it. However, police forces are expected to offer their services to the whole population without discrimination, economic included. Bottom line: The two target areas of enforcement &amp;quot;make society safest&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;make the most money for police force&amp;quot; are not identical. So which area would you rather be enforced by your police?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
"CMV: In an intimate relationship, you have an obligation to satisfy your partner's sexual needs.","Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said:  What happens after the honeymoon period when one person still desires sex, but their partner has lost interest (commonly referred to as a [dead bedroom](http://reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms))?  I think it's still the duty of the disinterested party to at least minimally fulfill the sexual needs of their partner, if sustaining the relationship is a priority. In bullet form, here's why:  * Each partner in the relationship is the others' only source of intimacy and sex (assuming a monogamous relationship), therefore if one partner withholds sex, the physical needs of the other is not being met. What is ultimately a chore or an inconvenience for one partner is a physiological necessity for the other.  * Compromise is fundamentally part of every aspect of a relationship, and sex is no different. I'm conflicted in my thinking on this point: No one should be made to have sex if they don't want to. However, both my SO and I do things for each other that we don't necessarily want to do because it's better for the relationship, or it makes the other happy. I don't believe sex and intimacy should be treated differently- it's reasonable to have expectations of sex as a requirement of the relationship.  Thoughts?","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with your general concept, but don&amp;#39;t understand why it wouldn&amp;#39;t work both ways. If a person desires to not have sex but then does so anyway, then their sexual needs aren&amp;#39;t being met in the relationship. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Why is it that you feel that the person with the lower libido is the only one who should have to compromise, when by doing so they are being left unfulfilled? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You make some really good points, OP. One thing to consider is that sex is not a physiological need, people go without it all the time. The benefits of orgasm can be achieved through masturbation, and the benefits of intimacy can be achieved through cuddling and other intimacy beside sex. If the partner also objects to cuddling and so on, then the high libido person can get this from people outside the relationship, just as a single person would. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: I'm anti abortion, and I feel like an asshole for being so.","WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that.     Most of the people that I look up to in life and seem to agree with all seem to support abortion. The people I see on the internet are supported for calling out someone who is against abortion, for instance reddit, to support abortion seems to be the widely regarded popular opinion. This probably isn't the best way to put it, but I seem to agree with every other popular political opinion on reddit (I should have thoughts of my own, and shouldn't form my opinions based upon some random website.) I like making fun of racist old assholes, I like making fun if homophobic old assholes, I like making fun of sexist old assholes, and I like making fun of religious old bigots, etc. etc. etc. But abortion seems to be the thing I disagree with, and I kind of feel like an asshole, like I must be missing some key point. I feel terrible that I have the opinion I do, because everyone seems to hate those who have it, and that's why I've come here, I must be missing some sort of point, and I hope that you can point it out for me. At first I just thought I didn't understand the issue well enough, but after I came to understand both sides of the debate, I can't help but wonder why everyone just accepts that a fetus isn't alive, and are kind of ignoring the moral implications of what if it's not? It's not that I think the fetus is necessarily alive, it's more along the lines that I don't think that you can prove that it's not alive (I genuinely don't think we will ever be able to definitively prove it). However I am going to counter my own argument here in saying that you can't prove that rocks aren't sentient either in the philosophical sense, but there is at least reason to believe that a fetus is more alive than a rock. When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality. Now I realize that it's not always consensual sex, and having to carry the child of someone who assaulted you is an absolutely horrendous thing, I would not wish that on my worst enemy, and I don't say that lightly, I really truly wouldn't. I can only imagine feeling as though I would just want to tear the child out no matter what. Never the less, life is life, a fetus is innocent, and the best I can recommend is some extreme therapy taken to whatever (healthy) extent necessary to help a person cope with such a thing. The ""it's going to happen anyway"" mindset I believe is just lazy, there are so many things on this planet that are going to happen anyway, are we just going to let them happen?     Of those who are fine with people having a different opinion, it seems as though the popular opinion among them is that those who are anti abortion should shut up and keep it to themselves, don't bother anyone with it, but to be honest I even disagree with that, I don't get mad at those who picket abortion clinics, I don't see it as a bad thing to do, they literally see abortion as murder, even if you do support abortion, try to get in that mindset, seeing something as murder and being told to shut up and ignore it. (This is also why I don't get mad at animal rights activists, I've seriously considered going vegan, and I kind of think following my own philosophy, it's selfish and hypocritical of me that I'm not.) I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live. We're having two different discussions and getting pissed at each other for not coming to the same conclusion. I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it's not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy. And maybe that's why I don't understand, maybe if it even remotely affected me my opinion would be different. I'm not certain. But please help me change my view, I feel like a total ignorant asshole.       TL;DR: I feel like an asshole for being against abortion _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

From a biological perspective, a fetus is definitely alive, as is anything made up of cells. When you say alive, are you referring to consciousness? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For me, whether or not it is &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; to kill a fetus is basically dependent on whether or not the fetus values its own life (i.e. wants to stay alive/wants to not die). For me, this makes the question pretty clear cut throughout most of pregnancy. You need to be able to think (i.e. have a mind) to value your own life, and all evidence points to the necessity of brain activity in order to think. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that a fetus must have brain activity in order for it to value its own life (and by extension for it to be wrong to kill the fetus). Before about 24 weeks, a fetus doesn&amp;#39;t have brain activity, so I assume that it doesn&amp;#39;t value its life at least during those first 24 weeks, and that it is acceptable to kill it. Even when a fetus does develop brain activity, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it will value its own life, but it&amp;#39;s much easier to draw a line at existence/nonexistence of brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus&amp;#39;s right to live. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think that the &amp;quot;person&amp;#39;s right to do what they want with their body&amp;quot; argument is pretty ridiculous. I think this because (1) if you don&amp;#39;t believe that a fetus is a person with a right life, then that argument really doesn&amp;#39;t matter anyway because killing the fetus is OK (2) if you believe that a fetus is a person with a right to life, that argument essentially says that when person X&amp;#39;s continued existence is sufficiently dependent on person Y, and person Y finds person X&amp;#39;s continued existence inconvenient, they&amp;#39;re allowed to kill X. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it&amp;#39;s not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy.

I&amp;#39;m not certain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Call me hyperrational, but I think that that rational conclusions should not be swayed when you realize that they are hard to live with. They should only be changed when you encounter something that alters your base assumptions or when you realize that your reasoning was faulty. If you change your beliefs based on what advances your interests, then you might as well just stop attempting to justify them rationally in the first place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody is saying fetuses aren&amp;#39;t alive. They are. They just should not be considered as &lt;em&gt;independent&lt;/em&gt; organisms that are subject to moral principles. My hand is &amp;#39;alive&amp;#39; in the same sense as a fetus is, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean cutting it off is the same as killing a person or animal. People often say fetuses develop into humans in time, therefore they are humans, but this does not account for the fact that they require the mother&amp;#39;s body to do so. A zygote does not &amp;#39;naturally&amp;#39; develop into a human without outside influence. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you have sex, you know it&amp;#39;s a possibility to get pregnant, it&amp;#39;s kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that&amp;#39;s the reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When you get in a car and drive somewhere, you know it&amp;#39;s a possibility that some idiot may crash into you, regardless of how careful you are.

"CMV: Not only should prostitution be legalized, but it's alarming that it isn't already.","This one seems so obvious to me but I'll provide the basic points:  It is a person's right to do whatever they want with their own body so long as doing so does not infringe on the rights of others.  Prostitution is, presumably, an agreement among consenting adults. I'm not trying to defend anything other than exactly this.  There is virtually no immediate difference between prostitution and pornography. Simply adding a camera with the intention of creating porn somehow makes the act legal.   The reason it is so alarming is that it is a blatant violation of our rights to our own bodies. It's the government tacitly saying they are the ultimate authority as to who we have sex with and under what circumstances it is permitted.  Most importantly, since people will do it anyway, making it illegal forces it underground (just like drugs). In the places where it is legal it can be heavily restricted in ways that prevent disease and the rights of the workers can be protected.     Since I don't think I've ever heard a single decent argument against this, I'm interested in having this deeply held belief challenged.  Edit: I'm having a hard time responding to everybody but I really appreciate everyone's input. My perspective on this issue has increased immensely even if my position hasn't really changed. I no longer think it's ""alarming"" that the US hasn't shifted it's consensus to my way of thinking.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

A study in Portland, Oregon, found that prostitutes were raped on average once a week. 85% of women in Minneapolis were raped. 94% of women involved in street prostitution have been sexually assaulted. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s check the Netherlands, a nice country where prostitution is &lt;strong&gt;legal&lt;/strong&gt;. 70% of women (prostitutes) experienced verbal threats of assault, 60% actually suffered physical assault, 40% experienced sexual violence and 40% were forced or pressured into the profession. PTSD rates are between 45 and 84%. From 5 countries, researches found that 2/3 of prostitutes have PTSD.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;a href=""http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/pdf/Prostitutionin9Countries.pdf""&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If one were to take away the having sex with strangers for money aspect, any profession that boasts such rates of PTSD and sexual assault, etc. isn&amp;#39;t anything that any government would want its citizens partaking in, especially as it isn&amp;#39;t necessary for society to function. Your parents when you were a kid probably didn&amp;#39;t want you going out and smoking crack cocaine, so they probably told you &amp;quot;you can&amp;#39;t do that&amp;quot;. That, with making the profession illegal, is what the government is doing- it don&amp;#39;t want its citizens prostituting themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It shouldn&amp;#39;t be legal because legalization promotes a lifestyle that is extremely harmful and has many adverse effects. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while I agree with you that overall, the arguments in favor of legalizing prostitution are better than the ones against it, maybe I can at least offer a couple of points.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) Legalizing prostitution might have a negative affect on poor women (or men, let&amp;#39;s keep this gender neutral). With such a readily available income source, people who are struggling to pay the bills might become prostitutes instead of pursuing their actual goals. Similarly to how children in developing countries could be &amp;quot;forced&amp;quot; into child labor if it is legal, people can be economically &amp;quot;forced&amp;quot; into prostitution. I believe people should have a right to their own body etc, but when economics are involved, it becomes a little fuzzy. For example, we do not allow people to sell body organs, because those who are desperate for money would feel compelled to.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) Prostitution is far harder to regulate than you seem to think, and it&amp;#39;s tough to protect men or women who are putting themselves in a vulnerable situation where they are alone with a &amp;quot;customer&amp;quot;. Sexual assault and other forms of violence are not uncommon in these situations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: I believe a Palestine state should be established in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt,"The state of Palestine has 4 million people residing within Isreal. The West Bank and Gaza strip together have 6,000 square kilometers of land. The North Sinai Governorate alone has 27,000 square Kilometers of land, that's more land than even Isreal has (22,000 sq km).  [Here is what a State of Palestine could look like on a map, either with only the Northern part or the full peninsula.](http://sinaimaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/governorates-sinai-egypt.jpg)  One could argue that the Sinai Peninsula is mostly desert and unfit for people to live in, but Israel was mostly desert when they began immigrating to the region too. Irrigation, agriculture, forestry, and artificial canals have been known to combat or reverse desertification.  The people already residing there can be promised equal citizenship rights in the new state of Palestine. Egypt could even allow for the people there to have duel citizenship, so that they can choose to either stay in the new state or easily move to inland Egypt. If necessary, Egypt could offer incentives for Sinai people to move inland prior to the establishment of the state.  If a ""buffer"" line/zone were felt to be necessary, it could be jointly run by Israel and Egypt stationed outside the borders without much issue from the Palestinians. The U.N. Security council could send peacekeepers to the peninsula to monitor the region's development. There would be very little reason for any of the Security members to veto this decision if Egypt, Israel, and Palestine all agreed to this.  Albeit, it's extremely unlikely this will ever happen, but I think it would be a good solution. Which is why I'm here, what is wrong with this plan?  **Edit:** Added what can happen with the people already living there.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One basic way of refuting this idea is by simply looking at the current situation in the Sinai Peninsula. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First, the region has always been populated by people. The native bedouin people have lived in that region far longer than you seem to be giving them credit for. Most of them migrated there between 1300 and 1700. Quite a long time for a place that so inhospitable. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, Israel might have been &amp;quot;mostly dessert&amp;quot; but the whole reason we need a Palestine state is because of the millions of people the Israel state forced into refugee status by making them leave. It might have been mostly dessert, but damn, it was home to a lot of people. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Egypt certainly could offer the things you mentioned to the Bedouin people. Egypt has abjectly refused to do so, and has created a terrible caste system whereby terrorist groups have thrived in the region, so I do not see this happening anytime soon. But sure, in a perfect world, that could theoretically happen. (Are you familiar at all with what is going on in this region??, are we talking about the same Egypt, the northern Africa country that has gone through three leaders in the past five years? The one with the pyramids?)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not even sure I want to talk about a buffer zone right now. Its late, and the current buffer zone is being executed so terribly and horrendously right now that I do not think that term should be uttered in geopolitical conversations concerning this region. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I guess more than anything I am confused by your view prompt. Are you saying that if the things you mentioned happened that a Palestine state could thrive? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I mean if the planets align and ponies sprout wings with rainbows coming out their butts, then yea sure this might happen. I would rather you suggest Utah as a solution, or maybe suggest building an island in the middle of the ocean out of old two litter bottles of soda. At least then, there is a more realistic possibility. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) What do you propose is done with the West Bank?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) Even ignoring the difficulty of actually growing crops in the Sinai, Israeli efforts to reduce desertification were possible only due to large amounts of foreign funds and resources that poured into the state after its foundation. The Palestinian diaspora has no such source of funding, hence it is doubtful that they would be able to actually water in a climate that is even more harsh than Israel&amp;#39;s is, on average.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) Israel is generally thought of as being one of the most over-populated areas in the world, relative to it&amp;#39;s carrying capacity. It is possible that global warming will exacerbate the issue along with the changing climate, and this would also likely apply to the Palestinian Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4) Egypt won&amp;#39;t sign on to it because it weakens their hold over the Suez Canal by putting a foreign nation on the other bank pretty close to the canal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;5) Palestine won&amp;#39;t sign on to it because, let&amp;#39;s face it, they just won&amp;#39;t. You&amp;#39;re implicitly saying that the Palestinians should be forced to move out of their present lands for no reason other than their own ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;6) Israel won&amp;#39;t sign on to it because lately the Israeli government has been against the establishment of any Arab Palestinian government in the region.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Politicians (specifically Presidential election candidates) deserve to be taken out of context.,"Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news ([x](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/hilary-clinton-the-sight-black-man-hoodie-scary-open-minded-whites/), [x](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/hilary-clinton-the-sight-black-man-hoodie-scary-open-minded-whites/)) after delivering a speech in which she said that ""for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear."" Publications from across the political spectrum tore her a new one for this comment in perceived poor taste. The article from the Federalist was spread on tumblr, and eventually popular user katara [reblogged with the full context](http://hunty.us/post/125041947641/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) of the quote, and people started criticizing the people passing around the articles for taking things out of context / not doing their research.      (Here's where my opinion comes in.) I think that tumblr's reputation of false alarm and out-of-context sound bites isn't unique to tumblr at all, it's the way popular American media has operated for the last few decades- if not more. [Many](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/09/18/just-the-scandal-of-the-week-or-a-turning-point/the-news-media-and-its-soundbite-culture) [people](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/our-sound-bite-culture-sh_b_93720.html) have discussed the ""sound-bit culture"" that becomes especially popular in presidential election cycles. Given that this is the norm for modern day news, I think politicians have a responsibility to avoid creating problematic soundbites.     Specifically, I think Clinton doesn't deserve the sympathy she's getting from [people](http://bleecake.tumblr.com/post/125130165347/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) who feel as though the media took her quote out of context. Clinton has been a politician for DECADES, she's got more experience than practically anybody- she's gone through 2 successful presidential election campaign as a candidate's spouse and this is her second presidential campaign as a candidate herself. She's been in more controversy over the years than anybody can keep track of. She's got almost unanimous support from the Democratic party, and lord knows she can afford good speechwriters and campaign managers. So why in the hell would she deliver a speech with the sentiment of basically ""Black people are scary... is what a racist would say. Racism is bad."" Surely, she knows people are only gonna take the first bit of that clip, and they're gonna run with it.      To me, the fact that this ""quotable"" passed through all the levels of Clinton's campaign team is just an indicator of how little anyone working for Clinton (including herself) really gives a shit. She could wake up tomorrow and say she intends on starting a nuclear war with Iran, and she'd still get the Democratic nomination. Because of that, I think the media has the right (and responsibility) to challenge Clinton. A good candidate is a candidate who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context.      We (the American people) are not getting the candidate we want or deserve, because we keep tripping over ourselves to help out Clinton.    _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any meaningful discourse about real, workable solutions to these complex problems will necessarily need descriptions that defy brief, quotable sound bytes.  You say &amp;quot;a good candidate is one who&amp;#39;s speeches can&amp;#39;t be misquoted/taken out of context&amp;quot;-- in other words, you are asking for a candidate whose speeches consist only of empty platitudes, and ignore all issues that are sufficiently complex as to require some &amp;quot;setup lines&amp;quot; in order to explain.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While it is true that the media prefers to focus on out-of-context sound-bytes (because this allows them to engage in low-effort, high-reward &amp;quot;gaffe journalism&amp;quot;), we the American people should push back on this tendency if we are ever to have any hope of a public discourse that is actually constructive.  You may be so cynical as to believe that no politician will ever be willing to take up these problems meaningfully; nonetheless, that&amp;#39;s how our system is designed, and if they don&amp;#39;t, no one else can.

This, in my opinion, is a good thing for democracy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a final note, I want to make a particular comment on your statement that &amp;quot;we keep tripping over ourselves to help out Clinton.&amp;quot;  I&amp;#39;m not sure who the &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; in this statement is meant to refer to, but the &lt;a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/10/after-two-decades-of-hostility-can-hillary-clinton-change-the-dynamic-between-her-and-the-press/""&gt;news media has a famously frosty relationship with the Clintons&lt;/a&gt; and certainly is not looking to do Hillary any favors if they can help it.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to never misspeak or have such hollow speeches that nothing can be taken out of context is not a good indicator of someone who will be a good legislator or executive. In the current climate of 24 hour news and internet fury over a mistake we are doing ourselves a disservice by keeping qualified people out of politics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Who are the types of people who have no skeletons in their closet (or paid to cover them up) and do research to figure out how people will react to every word you say? Only the rich and most power hungry. By saying everybody ought to speak perfectly all the time we are selecting the most out of touch people to be fun our government.

CMV: The US should allow airline cabotage.,"Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes.  Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities.    So Air Canada can fly a plane from Toronto to New York, but can't continue that plane on to Miami.  I think this rule is dumb and protectionist.  [Airline safety and protocols are subject to international treaties already,](https://www.faa.gov/passengers/international_travel/) and if we wanted, foreign airlines could be subjected to additional FAA safety checks as a condition of being allowed to engage in cabotage.  With the current state of the US airline industry being [so close-knit as to promote collusion,](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-doj-investigating-airlines-20150701-story.html) a healthy dose of competition seems like it's in order.  Opening up cabotage would allow a lot more competition in US aviation, which would be a big benefit to consumers as far as price.  It would also likely allow a lot of airports which aren't presently hubs to get better overseas service.  For instance, British Airways might not be able to justify a direct flight from Cleveland or St Louis to London, but it might be able to justify a flight that does St Louis - Cleveland - London.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

CMV:I feel uncomfortable with my hypothetical girlfriend wearing revealing clothing outdoors,"I've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are far from north american culture. You're expected to not reveal too much when dressing. I completely understand that everyone has the right to dress how they want to but I just don't feel like if you are giving yourself to your SO then you shouldn't let others see your body.   To me it is just a very special thing between two people to let the other person see and explore each other that no one else has. Too much cleavage or wearing no bras with thin shirts that let you clearly see the nipple and then she hugs other people makes me feel very uncomfortable. I would love to change my view, as I stand by the right that anyone can wear whatever they want, but this idea is just so integrated in my head after all my life living in it that I can't seem to shut it off ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay OP, I might have an answer for you. If you truly want to change your view it&amp;#39;s going to take a while and even then it might still not be fully changed.&lt;br/&gt; So you say you believe that people should be able to wear what they want. That&amp;#39;s good, as all people should have that right. Now the biggest issue that you have with it is that it makes you feel uncomfortable. Now I can&amp;#39;t make you not feel uncomfortable seeing your hypothetical girlfriend wearing revealing clothing outdoors, only you can.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Being uncomfortable with what your SO wears I think stems from jealousy. You feel that only you should have the right to see that part of your SO. But that&amp;#39;s not how the world works these days. You need to invest some trust into your hypothetical SO and realize that you&amp;#39;re the only man she wants to be with. Now why would a person with a SO wear revealing clothing? Because it could just be there style, or it makes the feel good about themselves. But you need to try and not be so possessive of your hypothetical SO, they are a person too and they are going to do what they want. And if you&amp;#39;re dating someone you should have enough respect for them to let them wear what they want, because when it comes down to it you don&amp;#39;t control their actions.   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now to change your feelings, the only solution that I have for you is honestly, to buck up. Changing an opinion that is ingrained into you culture is incredibly hard, but it is possible. I had to change how I felt uncomfortable with wearing certain things or discussing certain topics. And though it felt wrong when I did it, the more I kept at it the less wrong it felt. And about after 4 months I found that my feeling on the matter had changed. So if you want to change how you feel, you have to let your SO wear what they want. And if you don&amp;#39;t want to change that&amp;#39;s fine, but I personally would find an overly jealous SO to be undesirable.    &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hope that helps!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, this is not a VIEW. You would never say to your girlfriend, &amp;quot;You should not wear revealing clothes&amp;quot;. You seem like a rational guy. [Otherwise why would you be here?]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is a feeling of discomfort, due to inexposure to women wearing such clothes. There was a time when I was uncomfortable with the idea of having a girlfriend who has had sex with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Remember, our sexuality is not a commodity that we withhold to reveal to our &amp;#39;special partner&amp;#39;. Sure, it&amp;#39;s cute. You two can be like &amp;quot;see, this is so special to me and I only let you see it. That&amp;#39;s how special you are!&amp;quot;, it makes for a great, romantic, childishly sweet &amp;#39;made for each other&amp;#39; story for the couple, and it gives off a vibe of the relationship being &amp;#39;truly cemented and committed&amp;#39;, like a physical sign of love - [kind of like having a child together as a sign of love]. But YOU decide what your sign of love will be - the sight of her body, or your heart. These rules are not made in heaven. These perceptions are man-made. So YOU decide what you owe to each other. That &amp;#39;commodity&amp;#39;, is the heart. And the heart only.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When she makes love to you, tells you that you matter the most to her [besides other really important people like parents maybe], that she wants to grow old with you, have a child that is part you and part her[ain&amp;#39;t that special?], kisses you on the forehead, lets go of all inhibitions and opens her world to you, THAT, is the special thing you want. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When a women hugs someone, she is NOT thinking about her sexuality. The person who is getting hugged, is NOT thinking about her sexuality. So why should you worry?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Try watching videos of strong-minded women who look like they really love their partners but wear &amp;#39;skimpy&amp;#39; clothes. You will realize that a woman is so, so much more than her thighs and cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And remember - most probably only you will get to see her naked when and during she is in love with you. How about that. You&amp;#39;re gonna have your special &amp;#39;tickle&amp;#39; time anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: I think it's a selfish motive to purposely try to have children.,"I want children one day. Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, once you've had the kids it's selfless because of how much you have to give up for them. But the initial desire to birth them in the first place is selfish. I want my own children because I want to carry on my own genes. I want to have a little human that resembles me.  As a woman, I want to experience the feeling of a baby inside of me. These reasons are the main reasons why people choose to birth their own kids.  Here's a few reasons why I find it selfish.  1. There are plenty of children out there without parents. Over 150 million orphans, not to mention foster children. Then here are people who are trying to birth their own when there are so many helpless children without a loving home.  2. There are over 800 million people starving in the world. People are dying from hunger and you're trying to bring another mouth that needs feeding into the world.  3. This reason may be a little unexpected but it's something I'm personally afraid of and so I feel it's a valid reason. I'm agnostic. You can believe whatever you want about the afterlife but that doesn't mean you actually know what will happen to us after we die. Whether we go to a heaven, a hell, are reincarnated, cease to exist or whatever else people can come up with. You just can't  know for sure and anyone who says differently is lying to themselves. Now that being said, say hell is a reality. I hope it isn't but you never know. What if you birthed these children out of your selfish desire and they did just whatever it took to have themselves sent to hell forever. Even if you did pick the ""right"" religion doesn't mean that your child is going to believe it.    Honestly, I would love for someone to change my mind. My ex and I broke up over this because I want to adopt children and he wants biological children. I just can't morally justify purposely bringing children in the world.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

We don&amp;#39;t really have a problem making food for people. Transporting food is the problem(logistical or financial).  Unless you live somewhere where that is an issue your extra mouth doesn&amp;#39;t take food out of another&amp;#39;s. It&amp;#39;s no more selfish than feeding yourself. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for point 1. That voice in your head telling you to have a child is what connects us to all other sentient life.  We exist to reproduce.  It&amp;#39;s how we lived to take domain over the earth (and moon) in a darwinian sense you are acting selflessly sacrificing time energy and possibly health to broaden the human gene pool. (this also answers point three for me as well.  Unless you believe humans are truly special in the eye of some deity then we can be punished for being the animals we are.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world has always revolved around people having children.  It is innate in our biological make up to want to have children and raise them.   If everyone felt like you did, we&amp;#39;d have an opposite problem. In fact, Japan does have that problem and the US could be not too far behind them some believe.   While true plenty of children could use a good home, that doesn&amp;#39;t take away the biological desire to have your own children and the good that can come of having your own.    I can&amp;#39;t see why you can&amp;#39;t do both. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not so sure hunger is an over population problem as much as a logistics or greed problem.   We have plenty of food to feed everyone in the world now, we just don&amp;#39;t distribute it correctly.   You sound like a smart person, we could use smart genes being passed down into the pool.  That is a helpful thing to society.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Your last point is a strange one indeed.  I&amp;#39;m atheist, not agnostic, but we&amp;#39;ll leave that argument for another time and place.   However, being as I am, I can really address your beliefs on that point as they&amp;#39;re not mine, so I&amp;#39;d just leave it to say that&amp;#39;s a really remote thing to concern yourself with over wanting to have kids.   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I love my kid.   Not only does he look like me but he acts like me too, its evident even though he&amp;#39;s only 3.  I think the bond we&amp;#39;ll have when he&amp;#39;s older is far stronger than anything I could achieve if I adopted a kid, who I could love equally, but I&amp;#39;m not sure the same bond would exist.    Evolution has spent a long time perfecting things and there&amp;#39;s a reason you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to have a child, and why that child acts and looks like you.   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: There will never be another military draft (forced conscription) in America.,"Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view i hold.  My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any or all of them or bring up new issues I haven't thought of.    1) Unpopular: The draft for the war in Vietnam was extremely unpopular with massive protests and draft dodging.  After the draft was eliminated the protests died down even as the war continued.  It seems that America will support a lot of military activity (Iraq War 1 &amp; 2, Afghanistan, etc) as long as they are not personally forced to serve.    2) No close border crisis: Other modern developed countries have forced selective service (South Korea, Israel) but usually these countries face bordering existential crises to their very existence.  America does not have this, has not ever had this, and presumably will not ever have this and so there is no need to have millions of men and women be conscripted every year for a tour of duty.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription  3) Nuclear Weapons: America may face small attacks here and there but no nation state large enough to possibly overthrow the United States government seems likely to attack for fear of nuclear weapons retaliation.  While 9/11 was a tragedy, there was no hope of terrorists taking over the country or overthrowing the government.  The only world forces strong enough to do this would be large nations with large militaries of their own and if they did have a mainland ground force invasion of US soil it would almost guarantee a nuclear response.  4) Women, and the out of shape:  This is a minor reason but none the less I'll bring it up for discussion.  In a modern draft there would be seemingly no way for women to avoid serving.  Currently women face demanding physical aptitude tests to qualify for the most demanding positions or in some cases are barred from service for fear they will not be able to handle the physical requirements of the job (front line combat, Navy Seals, etc).  In the 21st century when men and women have equal rights and are largely treated equally there would be pushback if those less capable of serving were thought to be more likely to get an easier or safer assignment.  This would create a race to the bottom for applicants seeking to avoid dangerous duty.  Furthermore the vast majority of Americans are overweight, out of shape, and would require extensive training to become combat ready.  If diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, or any number of conditions would disqualify a person from service I imagine people would quickly engage in unhealthy habits (or bribe doctors) in order to avoid service.   5) Conscientious objectors: In previous generations there was a much stronger sense of duty, warrior culture, and sense of imminent danger which cultivated a value in service.  In the modern world, where people increasingly distrust their government, have more access to information, and are more likely to have diverse religious and philosophical views I do not see the public getting behind any major military involvement that would require a draft.  I would imagine there would be a rush to qualify yourself as a conscientious objector to the war in order to avoid combat even if that individual didn't feel that way immediately prior to the draft.    Please change my view!","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re only considering military threats, there are other scenarios that could mean large numbers of troops are needed, for a range of tasks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A huge natural disaster, such as a large scale volcanic eruption, small meteor impact, solar flare that knocks out the electrical supply worldwide - all of these would have massively disrupting implications in the US at home, and abroad. Civil disorder, food and water supplies being disrupted, large numbers of refugees, all of these could require the military to step in, requiring large numbers of additional personnel, which might have to be drafted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US will revert to a draft as soon as the US deems it necessary - which is when the number of volunteers do not met the numbers required.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To counter some of your points, look at this example: World War II.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;During World War II, &lt;a href=""https://www.sss.gov/induct.htm""&gt;over 10.1 million&lt;/a&gt; of the US&amp;#39;s sixteen million service members were &lt;em&gt;drafted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s right, WW2, a popular war most people today agree was worth fighting for, drafted over 60% of its servicemembers. Simply put: the US needed manpower, it drafted even when 6 million men volunteered.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Keep in mind too that conscientious objection was an even bigger issue in the past than today. The US was staunchly isolationist up until WW2, and many religious exemptions existed for groups like the Quakers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition, those servicemembers all served overseas. In fact, Vietnam was similar - the US maintained more troops in West Germany during this time than in Vietnam. Conscripts weren&amp;#39;t sent just to fight in Vietnam - many were sent to fill in ranks in Germany to keep our obligations there. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Our obligations worldwide are smaller today, true, but they still exist and may certainly grow again in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: Parents of fat children should be prosecuted just the same as pet owners who over feed their pets.,"In the UK we view cruelty to pets as terrible and prosecute and even ban pet owners from keeping them because the pets are vulnerable and cannot regulate their meals and feed themselves.  This is exactly the same for children. Parents dictate the child's diet and over feed and choose the wrong food types. If they consistently do this the child becomes obese and this has massive implications for the rest of their lives. Eating habits that have been learnt or not corrected , even right down to ""fussy eaters"" then gets passed on through generations and is the route cause for a massive percentage of the population.  We skim past the obesity argument because we don't want to offend and then because we turn a blind eye nothing gets fixed.  Punish and educate the parents just the same as a fat cat owner.  Children are more important than pets.  Change my view","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike with pets, children are cared for by others on a regular basis. Kids get food at school, daycare, their grandparents and other family members, the parents of their friends, babysitters, the list goes on and on. You&amp;#39;re holding 1-2 people responsible when there&amp;#39;s likely a larger community effecting the child.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;School lunches are the biggest one. Parents can&amp;#39;t control what their child chooses to eat at lunch and many can&amp;#39;t afford to pack lunches when their child can get a free or reduced price meal at school. Obesity and poverty run hand in hand, overweight children are more likely to be from parents who need their child to eat the maybe less-healthy option instead of packing them fresh veggies or whatever. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not to mention that your option is just BEGGING for abusive situations, both emotionally and physically. How much pressure would parents put on their kids to lose weight if it meant possible jail time? How many parents would hit their child for eating? How many kids would start to starve themselves because they&amp;#39;re afraid mommy and daddy will go to jail? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we consider pure pragmatics and the wellbeing of the child, this is not effective. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The desired behaviour is the child receiving proper nutrition and nutrition related modelling behaviour. The biggest barrier is parent behaviour and poverty: working poverty, fiscal poverty, generational poverty, knowledge, and habit. Criminalizing a behaviour is not as strong a deterrent as many people think (consider marijuana, piracy, and jaywalking). Charging the parents will not change their behaviours or make them more able to care for their children properly. Along with perhaps lacking motivation (this is arguable), these parents are often deeply lacking in skills, resources, money, and time. Charging them may strip them of even more money, community resource, and time. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Charging parent for a younger child&amp;#39;s weight also promotes child abuse via crash diets and laxatives, and rewards parents whose children may be malnourished but thin. Charging a parent for a school aged or older child brings into question the responsibility of the school as a nutritional provider and the child themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally, I assume the outcome of an unpaid charge is jail or apprehension. Removal of a child from parental care is extremely damaging and expensive, and can lead to generational repercussions. It is only &amp;#39;worth it&amp;#39; if the alternative is severe abuse or neglect. While childhood obesity could be called a form of neglect, the potential impacts of widespread institutionalization of otherwise happy children would be devastating.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To complicate things, there is strong evidence from a few recent studies that people do not know that their children are overweight (they literally don&amp;#39;t see it). Punishing people for something they don&amp;#39;t even know is happening and may not be able to control will not change behaviour at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: The actions of the McKinney TX police were not over the top,"I'm referring to this news story about the incident at the community pool in McKinney TX.  You can reference it here, the video is down the page and is approximately 7:23.  http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mckinney-texas-officer-leave-after-wild-pool-party-video-surfaces-n371281  I believe the premise is simple, if cops arrive on scene due to multiple reports of violence and encounter a large group of people and they are told to disperse and some refuse, they can be detained.  If they resist being detained, they can use force to detain you.  I'm not a lawyer or law enforcement, but I think this is how it works and is common sense.  Age or race does not preclude someone from following lawful orders.  You can see the order here (https://youtu.be/l4VayHJzaJU?t=2m20s ), she instead steps off in the opposite direction and is still talking at the cop, at which time he tries to detain her and she physically resists via pushing and pulling.  The cop in turn tries to push and pull her to the ground.    During her active resistance, a couple young gentleman approach in what initially seems an aggressive manner, with one of them moving their hand to their waste.  In hindsight, and slow motion on youtube, you can see that he was pushed towards the officer and off balance, but there was no way for that cop to know that at the time, so he drew his gun and backed them off.  I'm guessing that police are probably trained to do this.  The entire event concluded with one adult arrested, everyone else released and no injuries.    I think with all of the seriously horrible high profile police brutality in the news as of late, this story is getting caught up in America's typical response of reacting in an overly politically correct fashion, but I could be wrong.   _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Let us remember the situation here:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A group of kids were invited to a pool party at a community pool and were given guest passes a large number of them were black and the community pool was in a predominately white area. As far as we can tell the cops were called because the white people were alarmed by the number of black people and for no other real reason. Instead of talking to the kids, asking them what was going on. Or even listening to the fact that they had guest passes and were perfectly allowed to be there, the cops decided to be aggressive, yell at them, disperse them, and even pull a gun on kids that were running away. Basically putting every black kid they found onto the ground or yelling at them.

I felt both stories where instances of fluidity. One was on Gender Fluidity, the other being Ethnic Fluidity. Assuming Rachael actually feels much more comfortable as a black woman, I don't see why she should not be one.   I understand that it might be seen as an unfair comparison to say a sex change has the same weight as an ethnic change, but I can't help but think this decision on who we can and cannot be should not rest on society, but rather on ourselves. If we allow this, then perhaps we would see questions of ""yes you have decided to be a girl, but are you the right kind of girl?"" or ""you believe to be a christian, but are you the right kind of christian? Oh, you are transferring from being a Buddhist? No, you can't do that, religion and spirituality isn't for you to decide.""  Now I know that these particular examples the best in this circumstance, but I guess I'm trying to get at what happens when we have society decide what is the ""right kind"" of race for you to be.    TL;DR- Caitlin Jenner didn't get flack for a similar transformation, and what this should come down to is an individuals right to be who they feel comfortable being, not who society wants them to be. _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

As I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve read, and probably recoiled from, like it&amp;#39;s easy to do. I have.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So gender is a construct pushed on us by society. It&amp;#39;s a made up thing, lots of societies have words for more than the two genders we&amp;#39;re given. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The argument lots of people give is that race is also a construct pushed on us by society. It became &lt;em&gt;a thing&lt;/em&gt; when poor people started getting on too well and the rich needed some way to separate them and stop them fighting against the things keeping them down. That&amp;#39;s true. But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean experiences  of oppression are the same.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Someone not feeling the gender they are told they are experiences lifelong oppression. Because it&amp;#39;s a made up thing, but you&amp;#39;re told you can&amp;#39;t act a certain way, or wear certain things etc etc etc. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A white person doesn&amp;#39;t experience lifelong racial oppression in America. They never have. They may feel very close to black culture, but when it comes down to it, society doesn&amp;#39;t oppress them for their perceived race. Society won&amp;#39;t see them as something different to &lt;em&gt;white&lt;/em&gt; if they like &lt;em&gt;black&lt;/em&gt; music, or clothes, or culture. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If someone likes something other than what their expected gender norms are then they are put outside of those norms. And seen as, and treated as, different. This isn&amp;#39;t the case with race.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So to be trans is one thing. Because although gender is a societal construct, you experience lifelong oppression based on the breaking of that binary norm. To say you&amp;#39;re black? You haven&amp;#39;t experienced lifelong oppression based on breaking that societal norm.

CMV: Gender identity should be based upon the genitals with which you were born with and the hormones your body naturally produces.,"Hello everyone, with all the media coverage lately regrading transgender individuals I find myself uneducated on the particular subject and would love to be enlightened on the topic. I support the rights and henceforth of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals but can't wrap my head around the idea of transgenderism. From a purely medical/biological standpoint, it doesn't seem as if one should be able to claim to be the opposite gender when scientifically they have been classified to be the other. Even with the surgeries and artificial hormone replacements, wouldn't the artificial nature of these changes render the claim illegitimate? From a societal standpoint, obviously the idea of gender identity is one that has, for a majority of human history, been based around a singular core fact - we have two genders, man and woman, and you are either one or the other. Is there more to this perceived truth, or is transgenderism the result of a mental nuance that simply appears now because of the emergence of rights for the LGBT community, but has in fact, always been there?  This post isn't meant to attack/offend/etc. anyone, and again if I seem ignorant on the subject it is only because frankly I am and am only here to be educated. Thanks for any responses that can help me understand.  Edit: Thanks to everyone who's contributed (positively); I've learned a lot from this thread such as gender vs. sex, gender dysphoria, transgender vs. transsexual, etc. I definitely feel I have a better grasp of trans as a whole.  _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Gender identity is entirely subjective, so  &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t makes sense there in terms of a prescriptive statement.  Or, to put it another way, what anyone else thinks about whether a person is a man or a woman is is something &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; does make sense as a causal statement, in that ~99.9% of people have a gender identity and hormones that match the normal pattern.  (It&amp;#39;s worth noting that the genitals a person is born with are determined almost entirely by hormones and related gene regulatory systems during embryonic development)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;From a purely medical/biological standpoint, it doesn&amp;#39;t seem as if one should be able to claim to be the opposite gender when scientifically they have been classified to be the other&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since the word &lt;em&gt;gender&lt;/em&gt; is used to refer to social and behavioral qualities, I&amp;#39;ll assume you&amp;#39;re really referring to &lt;em&gt;sex&lt;/em&gt; here.  Actually, the biological development of two different sexes in humans isn&amp;#39;t as clear cut as you might think, as demonstrated by the existence of a plethora of different types of intersex categories.  For example, chromosomes don&amp;#39;t always match up with hormones or external genitals.  There are people with XY chromosomes who are born with vulva/vagina, and there are people with XX chromosomes who are born with a penis.  Some people have XXY chromosomes, rather than XX or XY.  Due to the way human developmental biology works, these people are typically externally male.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sex is a set of biological characteristics that typically go together but don&amp;#39;t always.  Quite a few of these biological characteristics can actually be (biologically) changed over time with hormones.  Skin, body hair, fat distribution, musculature, breasts... these are all things that change, biologically.  Once that change has taken place, the result is often very similar to siblings of the target sex.  Transgender men grow body and facial hair, build muscle more easily and in different places, their voices drop, they smell like cis men, get male-pattern baldness, etc...  The skin of transgender women softens and they grow breasts typically about a cup size smaller than cis-women siblings.  If the transition starts before something called   Once these changes take place, the scientific/biological classification of them as men or women becomes less clear.  Scientifically/biologically speaking, they become inter-sex.  Hormones change almost everything other than primary reproductive organs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;for a majority of human history, been based around a singular core fact - we have two genders, man and woman, and you are either one or the other. Is there more to this perceived truth, or is transgenderism the result of a mental nuance that simply appears now because of the emergence of rights for the LGBT community, but has in fact, always been there?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Several cultures have recognized trans- and/or third genders since more or less the dawn of recorded history.  Other commenters have probably mentioned the hijra and native-american two-spirit people as examples.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This post isn&amp;#39;t meant to attack/offend/etc. anyone, and again if I seem ignorant on the subject it is only because frankly I am and am only here to be educated. Thanks for any responses that can help me understand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, trans-men cannot become cis-men, and trans-women cannot become cis-women.  If you wanted to classify them as accurately as possible, you&amp;#39;d have to say they were inter-sex by choice, but in many ways closer to the sex typically associated with their self-identified gender.  Since typical language use doesn&amp;#39;t communicate all this information, it&amp;#39;s best just to go with what (1) respects the person&amp;#39;s self-identification and (2) is probably closer to anyway.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you are interacting with a person who has a full beard, bald head, deep voice, strong upper-body muscles, and acts like a guy, don&amp;#39;t you just default to using masculine pronouns and names rather than asking about their genitals first?  Yeah, the reality is more complicated, but referring to that person as a man is &amp;quot;less wrong&amp;quot; than referring to that person as a woman.  And constantly being more specific (1) emphasizes that person&amp;#39;s difference, probably in a way that&amp;#39;s very hurtful and (2) puts them in danger of potentially being discriminated against (or even violently attacked) for being queer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;TL;DR, transsexuals become scientifically/biologically intersex, and while the reality is somewhat more complicated, the transformation is sufficiently robust that it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;less wrong&amp;quot; to call trans-women women and trans-men men than vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Source:  Am trans-woman, scientist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, to start off with, there&amp;#39;s a big divide between biological sex and gender. I highly recommend you research this more, but I&amp;#39;ll try to touch on the basics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sex is rooted in an organism&amp;#39;s DNA, and is defined by which reproductive cells (sperm or eggs) they produce. Animals with testes who produce sperm are biologically male, and animals with ovaries who produce eggs are considered female. You&amp;#39;re probably familiar with X and Y chromosomes, which is how sex is determined in humans, right?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Actually, things go wrong. &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_gonadal_dysgenesis""&gt;Swyer Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; is a big example, in which a person has an XY chromosome but something goes wrong with the Y. Humans are actually female by default, and the Y chromosome is required to activate in order to form male parts. Without it, people with Swyer develop uteri, vaginae, and other normal female organs. However, they have streak gonads which don&amp;#39;t produce sperm OR eggs. So what do you call them? Their chromosomes say male. Their organs say female. But they can&amp;#39;t reproduce as either one. This is just one of many examples of conditions that show how sex is not even nearly as straightforward as it seems when everything goes normally.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, this is only half the problem. Now we need to address gender. While there are several definitions of gender, some of which address biology, the accepted definition in most of the social sciences is the combination of external and internal social features that are associated with masculinity or femininity. These usually, but not often, correlate with sex. But for obvious reasons, people who lack an easily definable sex might also be hard to correctly gender. But, clearly, these people aren&amp;#39;t genderless, they still have elements of masculinity and/or femininity. That leads us to the question: if gender can be rooted in something that isn&amp;#39;t biology, isn&amp;#39;t it always rooted in something else, at least partially?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The easy answer is a person&amp;#39;s feelings. Hormones, body structures, socialization, and a thousand other things can feed into how we perceive our gender, leading to the inevitable conclusion that gender is determined primarily by how we act and how others act towards us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Imagine, if you will, that you find out tomorrow you actually have two X chromosomes. I&amp;#39;m assuming you&amp;#39;re male, or at least you think you are. But for all you know, your genitals are the product of elaborate surgery when you were an infant- you actually were born with a vagina and streak gonads, but your clitoris was large enough that doctors were able to turn it into a penis and give you testicular implants. I&amp;#39;ll admit, it&amp;#39;s far-fetched, but in the end it&amp;#39;s very hard to know our sex for certain until we&amp;#39;ve conceived a child or had serious testing done. But let&amp;#39;s assume it happens. Would you immediately ask for breast implants, get your facial hair permanently removed, and start dating men while considering yourself straight? Probably not, right? Your gender goes deeper than just what you understand your body to be.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you were abducted by aliens and had your sex switched against your will, do you think you would still identify with your prior gender?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, don&amp;#39;t get me wrong. There&amp;#39;s a heavy correlation between sex and gender for a reason, and part of that is biology. Testosterone does correlate with aggressive, masculine behavior. But there are plenty of aggressive women, right? And while pregnancy does cause mothers to form a tight chemical bond with their children, there are fathers out there who form just as close of an emotional connection without being pregnant. Our bodies might make it easier to act as our gender, might give us the right chemical cues and biological urges, but they do not define everything we feel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, gender isn&amp;#39;t even so much about feelings as it is the way we act. Crossdressing proves this- a convincing crossdresser knows how to present themselves as the opposite gender, to the point where few people will ever guess their sex doesn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;match up&amp;quot;. Have you ever wanted to wear a dress, just to see what it&amp;#39;s like? Wished someone would bring you flowers or pick you up for prom or be the big spoon? Maybe you wanted to wear pink or high heels or makeup? You could even enjoy baking or childcare or color-organizing your sock drawer, for all I know. Ovaries don&amp;#39;t make someone any more likely to enjoy the color pink than testicles do, these things are based in our personal preferences and how we were socialized as kids.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Being transgender means that your genitals don&amp;#39;t match up with the gender that you relate most to. Most of us have some preferences and behaviors that don&amp;#39;t line up with our gender, like tbulldykes. They are clearly able to have these masculine feelings, preferences, and behaviors while still identifying as a woman. However, is it so hard to believe that they could have a few more of those preferences, pushing them into predominantly masculine territory? People fall all over the spectrum; we do a lot of policing to tell children what they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;supposed&amp;quot; to do and like, but if you watch toddlers at play when they&amp;#39;re still too young to have this solidly internalized, you&amp;#39;ll see there are a good number of girls who run with the boys and boys who play house with the girls. Being transgender later in life is just like that on a more complex scale, having preferences that are mostly feminine when you have testes or masculine when you have ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Basically, our bodies don&amp;#39;t define what we think, feel, and do. From a biological standpoint of sex, maybe we really can&amp;#39;t change. But from a social and cultural point, it&amp;#39;s not only possible, it&amp;#39;s fairly easy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,1.0
CMV: There is no possible advantage to playing a first-person shooter at less than the maximum resolution available to you.,"To get this out of the way early: **This is not going to be a PCMR circlejerk.** An unnecessary reminder: this subreddit is for reasoned persuasion, not mutual masturbation.   I'm talking strictly about advantages **in professional, competitive, skill-based, PvP shooters** given by playing at a lower resolution, taller aspect ratio (4:3 vs 16:9), or narrower FOV (excepting personal tolerance for distortion).   [This is the photo that prompted my question.](http://i.imgur.com/9Lo87yI.jpg) There is absolutely NO WAY that playing at 1024x768 (and unless that's a 1440p monitor, I think it's reasonable to suspect it's actually 800x600) gives him ANY advantage, and is instead a handicap, but it's not uncommon for professionals to play this way (I'm thinking in particular of the CS:GO / CS:S scene).   **Points of confusion:**  * With upscaling disabled, the pixels are the same size as they would be if he were playing at native resolution, so there's no 'zoom' offered.  * Lower resolution means, definitively, less rendering precision. If an enemy's head is visible over an edge at distance, it may not take up enough of the player's FOV to be rendered (possibly an unlikely example). Also, the player is less able to aim in small increments. These are non-issues issue at 1080p+ resolutions.  * UI elements (note especially the map and kill feed in the linked photo) are measured in pixels, and so obscure a HUGE percentage of available vision. This is greatly reduced by having more pixels on the screen. * Horizontal FOV (at a given level of distortion) suffers because of the narrower 4:3 aspect ratio. Limited peripheral vision is an obvious disadvantage that's very simply fixed with a widescreen 16:9/16:10 aspect ratio.   **Warrants** (I believe that's the appropriate term) **/ Assumptions:**  ^(^Read: ^""These ^arguments ^are ^either ^completely ^ineffective ^""against"" ^me ^or ^irrelevant ^to ^a ^sponsored ^professional."")  * No hardware limitations (GPU inadequacy, etc). * A competitor wants every advantage available to them, especially the legal/fair ones.  * A professional recognizes that 'their way' might not be the best way, and would readily change for the sake of improvement. * Access to more information is always better.  * Greater precision is always better.   So, why would anyone play at 800x600 or 1024x768? ""Because they're used to it"" seems to be the most common answer, but I feel like that's nothing but lazy and backwards.  ^(Please forgive any formatting mistakes; I'm on mobile. I'll correct them as soon as I get back to a desktop.)","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fovea of your eye is a small part right in the center of your retina and field of vision. You have the clearest vision there, and it slowly deteriorates the farther you get away from there.

A smaller resolution allows for the entire game&amp;#39;s field of vision to be in that small part of your eye that sees best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some folks, it definitely is hardware related. Not that they can&amp;#39;t run it at max settings, but lower resolution would remove precious nanoseconds to any action they performed.

I have a cluttered desk,  and sometimes the visual &amp;#39;busyness&amp;#39; of the desk distracts me  when game play action happens near the edge of the screen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: Gender fluidity is not a thing.,"In response to this [article](http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a28865/ruby-rose-oitnb/). I believe you can be a man or a woman or trans, and you can be any sexual orientation you want under the rainbow! Every persons orientation is a little nuanced. I don't believe you're gender can be nuanced. You are a man or a woman, whether you were born that way or you underwent physical changes later in life because you knew deep down that you were a man/woman under the skin you were born in. I don't believe you can make a daily choice to identify as a different gender. So you are a girl who hates skirts? You aren't a man because of that, you are just a girl who hates skirts. Not conforming to gender roles doesn't mean that you have the choice to identify yourself as a different gender whenever you please.    When a trans person switches, they have to jump through all sorts of hoops to legally be a gender. If we recognized ""gender fluidity"" all sorts of problems could arise, such as ""which change room should I use?"". Would it just change depending on how they were feeling that day? Would we all be okay with men, deciding that they are more of a woman today, going into female change rooms and stripping down in front of children?   I don't believe that people really feel the need to change their genders on a daily basis, and I don't agree with those who would try to force me to respect their ""fluid"" gender. There is already a term for people who don't conform to gender stereotypes and it's androgyny. I consider myself to be a very open person, especially when it comes to other peoples personal choices that don't affect me so please CMV.   EDIT: u/Paimon has changed my view about gender fluidity being a thing. It's a thing. I still disagree with most of you saying there are no legal or social ramifications though, especially about the change rooms, and on how to address someone who is gender fluid.     EDIT 2: A lot of people are trying to change my view based on what they think the world should be like (i.e gender neutral bathrooms and change rooms) rather than being realistic about what it actually is (women have to be guarded in order to protect themselves from sexual harassment.) I still don't believe that men with biological man parts should be allowed to waltz into a women's change room because they are feeling like a woman that day, and that I should just trust that they know better than I do what their gender is when their dick is in my face.   That being said I understand how they is a good term over he/she. It sounds weird to call a girl a they but if someone asked me to refer to them that way, obviously I would. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gender is a physical thing. People tend to say things like sex is what is in your pants, and gender is what&amp;#39;s in your head. Or that gender is just a social construct (it turns out that sex is also a social construct, but it&amp;#39;s a bit complicated, and not part of this post).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So, when someone has an intersex condition they have either ambiguous genitalia, gonads or chromosomes. Currently the brain isn&amp;#39;t included in the definition of intersex. That said, there is pretty &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism#Brain_structure""&gt;strong evidence&lt;/a&gt; that being trans is a neurological condition. In my opinion it should be considered a congenital neurological intersex condition.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, if you read the first few paragraphs you&amp;#39;ll find out two things: first, the BSTc is hormone aplastic (it doesn&amp;#39;t change shape based on the level of sex hormones), and second, that it doens&amp;#39;t differentiate until adulthood, but we have trans people being certain about their gender well before then, so we have to look elsewhere for a cause (at least for early onset gender things).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If the BSTc doesn&amp;#39;t change shape, then it&amp;#39;s obviously not relevant to genderfluidity, though being part way between the two sizes might account for gender being looser than normal. But what about the parts of the brain that are sensitive to sex hormones and do change based on the pretense or absence of E or T? &lt;a href=""http://www.eje-online.org/content/155/suppl_1/S107.full""&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; talks about the parts of the brain that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; change based on hormone therapy. If someone&amp;#39;s brain is not especially solidified because of the aplasitc parts being somewhere in the middle, then slight hormone fluctuations could well switch identity from one side to another. I&amp;#39;m not saying that that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; how it works, since it&amp;#39;s not a thing that has been studied all that much, but it&amp;#39;s certainly well within the realm of possibility based on what we do know about gender.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Androgyny is based on appearance, and not identity. Agender is a thing, but it is not the same as gender fluid. Trans people don&amp;#39;t or can&amp;#39;t always get genital surgery, this doesn&amp;#39;t make them any less of a man or woman than any other man or woman with a condition that caused them to lose their genitals. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The &amp;#39;man changing in front of little girls&amp;#39; thing is a pretty big stereotype that doesn&amp;#39;t really happen. Stalls are a thing, and most gender non-conforming people are well aware of the shape of their bodies, and bladder issues are a pretty big issue for a lot of trans people who have to hold their pee in all day because they can&amp;#39;t use public washrooms without the risk of physical assault.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Generally if someone is genderfluid, they&amp;#39;ll know you have no way of knowing they are identifying as that day, so they probably won&amp;#39;t flip out at you. But you can always ask.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am by no means an expert, I&amp;#39;ve just been really interested in gender/sexuality issues for a while and I&amp;#39;ll explain it how it makes sense to me. So please if someone is reading this and I am wrong, correct me please!! &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I look at this in 3 categories: sex, gender, and sexuality. I see sex as being your physical situation, sexuality being who you are attracted to, and gender being how you feel inside. Sex, to me, can be male, female, intersex, or any combination thereof. This is fairly straightforward and there aren&amp;#39;t many arguments about this, I think.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sexuality is the next easiest one, and it seems like you understand this one pretty similarly to how I do. A little nuance here is the separation of sexual attraction and romantic attraction, so for example you can want to be romantic with people but totally uninterested in sex (heteroromantic, asexual). These two things are important in defining gender.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m gonna talk about transgender people for a minute as a preface to gender. Generally, transgender people have symptoms of gender dysphoria, which is recognized in the &lt;a href=""http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf""&gt;DSM-V&lt;/a&gt; (it used to be called gender identity disorder until this edition of the DSM), and take steps to alleviate it by either transitioning (hormones, surgery) or presenting (binders, makeup, clothes) as another gender. Transgender people have symptoms of gender dysphoria, and more often than not, they have serious body dysphoria as well,  where they feel disgusted by their bodies or just feeling &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; in their skin. It&amp;#39;s a horrible place to be mentally and can lead to serious depression and self harm. That&amp;#39;s why hormone replacement therapy is important, because it tries to eliminate body dysphoria or at least tone it down a few notches. I bring this up because gender fluidity is basically the same thing, except gender fluid people either do not have body dysphoria or they do not experience it to the same degree. They have the same feelings of &amp;quot;wrongness&amp;quot; about aligning their gender with their sex, and personally I think this has a lot to do with how pervasive gender roles are in society.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of classes of gender fluidity, and while some of them are fluid on a day-to-day basis like you described, the more common varieties tend to sit somewhere in the middle. The &lt;a href=""http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2015/03/the-genderbread-person-v3/""&gt;Genderbread Person&lt;/a&gt; (with a more in-depth explanation &lt;a href=""http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/03/the-genderbread-person-v2-0/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is a really awesome illustration that you can play around with. It&amp;#39;s a combination of identity (how you feel) and expression (how you present), using socially defined gender norms of femininity and masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An important thing to keep in mind is, when we are looking at issues like restrooms or changing rooms, is that individuals who are genderfluid are not &amp;quot;men going in a women&amp;#39;s bathroom&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;women in a man&amp;#39;s changing room,&amp;quot; because I feel like that has more of a predatory connotation. It&amp;#39;s really up to the individual which one they want to use. In my opinion, changing rooms are not a big deal, but restrooms go by what you present as (ex. if you are a trans-man, you use a stall in the men&amp;#39;s restroom). (As mentioned in another comment, gender neutral restrooms are the best way to solve this I think, and more and more public places are starting to implement them which is really awesome!!)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The way I look at it is like, since hormone therapy requires recommendations from doctors and therapists, legally identifying as genderfluid should be managed the same way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: I don't believe a person can be truly compassionate before having experienced a prolonged state of egolessness.,"I have a general feeling about whether a person has experienced living without ego or not by observation of where they place the importance of their own wants against the needs of others. From this, it is my belief that a person cannot be actively compassionate in every day life when they have not experienced the falseness of self because the ego is the only self they are truly aware of.  Compassion being defined as being able to possess a love for all beings that is as great as that for the self and the closest people in their lives.  Truly compassionate being defined as actively compassionate in every day life for all those that they can have an effect on.","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we are to take something like Dunbar&amp;#39;s Number seriously, that is, to assume there is a physical limit of our ability to understand the social connections between people known to the individual, then it follows that other socially-dependent concepts, like empathy and compassion, also have their limits, in that they can only be applied in their totality to a limited number of things. You are physically incapable of understanding and having compassion for &lt;em&gt;every single living thing&lt;/em&gt;, rather, in order to have the compassion of the type you&amp;#39;ve defined, the individual must create for themselves an idea or representation that stands in place for that complete understanding. They must substitute what they do understand, which in this case is the &amp;quot;love&amp;quot; they have for themselves and those they do know, to fill in gaps for what they are incapable of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What that means is that the person who is feeling compassion for all living things, as a matter of physiology, is in fact &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; doing such, as much as they are creating a heuristic for &amp;quot;compassionate&amp;quot; behavior. They love &lt;em&gt;the idea of &amp;quot;all living things&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; because they cannot understand what &amp;quot;all living things&amp;quot; actually represents, much less have feelings for. This process is wholly dependent on the ego - a lack of self concept means lacking the ability to do that substitution.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, that leaves unanswered the question of whether a temporary suspension of the ego is necessary to create an effective heuristic for compassionate behavior. I argue &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;. There is nothing to suggest, on a conceptual level, that the forming of such a pattern of behavior necessitates experiencing something like the &amp;quot;ego death&amp;quot; often attributed (though not exclusive) to LSD, Ayahuasca, dissociatives, etc.  It would seem to be the case that a supreme ego is necessary, one which is able to substitute for a lack of knowledge of others the knowledge of itself, and act as though it were interacting with a being of the same makeup. Temporary suspension may be &lt;em&gt;helpful&lt;/em&gt;, but you haven&amp;#39;t demonstrated any reason for thinking one is incapable of doing this kind of &amp;quot;ego substitution&amp;quot; without this experience. Rather, one could be a kind of narcissist/solipsist who believes all people are them, and exhibit the same behavior for which your view seems to aim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why do you believe this?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t exactly seem well founded or explained in your post.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Why can a person who hasn&amp;#39;t experienced egolessness be truly compassionate?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Why has your mushroomtrip or whatever made you able to be more &amp;quot;truly&amp;quot; compassionate then someone who hasn&amp;#39;t?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Are you (or others who can be truly compassionate) actively more compassionate then everyone else? Or is your quality of compassion better?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Are there people who do more compassionate things then you, but have not experienced egolessness? Are they still &amp;quot;worse&amp;quot; then you even if they do more for some reason?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: I'm anti abortion, and I feel like an asshole for being so.","WARNING: WALL OF TEXT!!! I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that.     Most of the people that I look up to in life and seem to agree with all seem to support abortion. The people I see on the internet are supported for calling out someone who is against abortion, for instance reddit, to support abortion seems to be the widely regarded popular opinion. This probably isn't the best way to put it, but I seem to agree with every other popular political opinion on reddit (I should have thoughts of my own, and shouldn't form my opinions based upon some random website.) I like making fun of racist old assholes, I like making fun if homophobic old assholes, I like making fun of sexist old assholes, and I like making fun of religious old bigots, etc. etc. etc. But abortion seems to be the thing I disagree with, and I kind of feel like an asshole, like I must be missing some key point. I feel terrible that I have the opinion I do, because everyone seems to hate those who have it, and that's why I've come here, I must be missing some sort of point, and I hope that you can point it out for me. At first I just thought I didn't understand the issue well enough, but after I came to understand both sides of the debate, I can't help but wonder why everyone just accepts that a fetus isn't alive, and are kind of ignoring the moral implications of what if it's not? It's not that I think the fetus is necessarily alive, it's more along the lines that I don't think that you can prove that it's not alive (I genuinely don't think we will ever be able to definitively prove it). However I am going to counter my own argument here in saying that you can't prove that rocks aren't sentient either in the philosophical sense, but there is at least reason to believe that a fetus is more alive than a rock. When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality. Now I realize that it's not always consensual sex, and having to carry the child of someone who assaulted you is an absolutely horrendous thing, I would not wish that on my worst enemy, and I don't say that lightly, I really truly wouldn't. I can only imagine feeling as though I would just want to tear the child out no matter what. Never the less, life is life, a fetus is innocent, and the best I can recommend is some extreme therapy taken to whatever (healthy) extent necessary to help a person cope with such a thing. The ""it's going to happen anyway"" mindset I believe is just lazy, there are so many things on this planet that are going to happen anyway, are we just going to let them happen?     Of those who are fine with people having a different opinion, it seems as though the popular opinion among them is that those who are anti abortion should shut up and keep it to themselves, don't bother anyone with it, but to be honest I even disagree with that, I don't get mad at those who picket abortion clinics, I don't see it as a bad thing to do, they literally see abortion as murder, even if you do support abortion, try to get in that mindset, seeing something as murder and being told to shut up and ignore it. (This is also why I don't get mad at animal rights activists, I've seriously considered going vegan, and I kind of think following my own philosophy, it's selfish and hypocritical of me that I'm not.) I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live. We're having two different discussions and getting pissed at each other for not coming to the same conclusion. I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it's not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy. And maybe that's why I don't understand, maybe if it even remotely affected me my opinion would be different. I'm not certain. But please help me change my view, I feel like a total ignorant asshole.       TL;DR: I feel like an asshole for being against abortion _____  &gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I&amp;#39;d like to know. But it&amp;#39;s all in the definition. So my opinion on abortion came from asking &amp;quot;For a moment, let&amp;#39;s say they are persons. Let&amp;#39;s even say zygotes are persons!&amp;quot; From a pro-choice standpoint, this is the worst case scenario, yes? We&amp;#39;ll grant the pro-life movement that every fertilized egg is in fact a full person, just like you and me.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Even then, I am pro-choice because I do not think we have a responsibility to other people that goes nearly that far. We do not require people to donate organs, or even blood (which has sooo much less consequence than pregnancy for a much shorter time). Not even to their own children. We do not require people to help others even if they are able. If you want to throw away your food and let someone starve, legally, you can. We may not LIKE this behavior. We may think it is rather awful, even. But we don&amp;#39;t want to make it ILLEGAL, because we respect the rights of people to do what they want with their property. We ought to do at least as much for our bodies, which are literally US. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Basically, I think that the question of personhood is actually not one we need to answer in this debate, because no person can hang out inside you, using your organs, causing you substantial discomfort and the potential of death, for 9 months. We wouldn&amp;#39;t make anyone sign up for that to save anyone else, not even their child. So why would we do it in the case of pregnancy?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If your answer is &amp;quot;they signed up for it cus sex,&amp;quot; did you sign up for the car accident because you drove? What if you were going over the speed limit? Did you consent to all possible consequences of driving? Maybe, but we still try to save your life when you crash. We do this even for people who are engaging in quite dangerous behavior. Taking a risk (having sex, particularly in the case of having sex with protection) does not mean you signed up for the worst outcome. You know it may happen, but you aren&amp;#39;t signing up for it any more than you are signing up for a car accident on your way to work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll ignore the fact, for now, that in the case of rape no consent was ever given at all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is why I think abortion should be legal, even if I don&amp;#39;t like it very much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I honestly don&amp;#39;t know anyone who is pro abortion. It&amp;#39;s a sad and traumatic thing to choose to do, and I&amp;#39;m not sure it&amp;#39;s something I would ever choose for myself. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But not for one second do I think my choice not to have an abortion should affect someone&amp;#39;s hard choice to have one.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When is it okay to limit a woman&amp;#39;s right to do as she wishes with her own body? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A women&amp;#39;s right to control her reproductive organs should not end the moment someone sticks a penis inside her. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It shouldn&amp;#39;t end when he ejaculates, it shouldn&amp;#39;t end just because she happens to be ovulating, or because an egg is inseminated. So when should her rights be limited with respect to her choice to abort the pregnancy? When should the rights of a fetus outweigh her right to choose her own destiny? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Obviously by the time she gives birth, that fetus has full rights to life. But when did they start? Did the child&amp;#39;s rights to life gradually come into being, or were they switched on suddenly?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think that the fetus should only be deemed to have rights when it could theoretically survive even if the mother tragically died.  Only at this point do I see any point in supporting a fetus&amp;#39; rights. Before this it is too much a part of its mother to survive on its own and therefor too much a part of its mother to have rights separate from hers. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So do I support abortion? No. Do I support it being legal? Absolutely! &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also, I&amp;#39;m a man so who gives a shit what I think. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
"CMV: It's not ""creeping"", ""snooping"", or ""being a creeper"" to browse social media content that presumably was put there for exactly that purpose.","**Edit:** I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas.   Thanks  -  I don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now.   Suppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a ""creep"" for ""looking through"" her profile.   I'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have ""good old days"".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as ""creeping someone's profile"" online. Putting aside when a ""profile"" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more.   So the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...  I feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them.

The definition I like best (credit to &lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;ei=_xJfVdDBLcb_ywPdgYLoAg&amp;amp;url=http://crypto.stanford.edu/portia/papers/RevnissenbaumDTP31.pdf&amp;amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGBN-P8lmftoRARQIaFC7puTCFEQA&amp;amp;sig2=Gt2vJs2OOigOi9cgEkJ1dA""&gt;Helen Nissenbaum&lt;/a&gt;) holds that it means having a certain degree of control over information about oneself. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That control can be achieved in a number of different ways. Your home is generally a private place by default, because access is physically restricted to those who are invited inside. But the privacy of your home isn&amp;#39;t contingent on the fact that people aren&amp;#39;t able to get through your door without a key. The fact that it&amp;#39;s understood as a private space leads to a generally acknowledged &lt;em&gt;expectation&lt;/em&gt; of privacy that demands the respect of others by way of an unspoken social contract, so that you feel your right to privacy has been violated when someone on the roof of the neighboring building peers into your bedroom window through binoculars.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another form of privacy is that which we expect to have in otherwise public spaces, even when we&amp;#39;re completely surrounded by strangers. Think about what it&amp;#39;s like to have a conversation in a crowded restaurant. Although it&amp;#39;s true that everyone around you can easily eavesdrop, you aren&amp;#39;t speaking to them, and the social norms governing that situation dictate that they should ignore you. If someone were to sit nearby and actively listen to you and your friends without having been invited, you&amp;#39;d probably feel that your privacy wasn&amp;#39;t being properly respected.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Online social media spaces are a lot like that. Everybody has access, but having access isn&amp;#39;t the same thing as having an invitation. Do you remember how upset people were when Facebook first rolled out the news feed? None of the things being displayed there were shown to people who didn&amp;#39;t already have access to them, but the architecture of the virtual space had been radically altered. Exchanging wall posts used to be like having a private conversation in a restaurant. Suddenly, it was more like &lt;em&gt;performing&lt;/em&gt; a conversation on a stage, in full view of a room full of people who were actively paying attention. Check out &lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;ei=JxdfVa2wIpDJogTet4OoDw&amp;amp;url=http://www.danah.org/papers/FacebookPrivacyTrainwreck.pdf&amp;amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNF8fUtm1RijtNSQnmv9HjXtSoUI-g&amp;amp;sig2=u9tqPkv_lOBeSGrI3-Wxbg""&gt;danah boyd&amp;#39;s article&lt;/a&gt; on the Facebook community&amp;#39;s reaction to that event.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When people call you a creep for knowing about something they&amp;#39;ve shared on Facebook, what they&amp;#39;re really upset about is the fact that you&amp;#39;ve misunderstood your relationship with them and that information. You may have had access to it, but it wasn&amp;#39;t meant for you. You&amp;#39;ve joined a conversation to which you weren&amp;#39;t invited. Being able to recognize the difference between a conversation that you&amp;#39;re allowed to join and one you&amp;#39;re supposed to ignore even when it&amp;#39;s happening right in front of you is a social skill that is just as important online as it is in real life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t use the the fact that something is allowable online as justification for expecting people not to act negatively toward a behavior.  Especially when said behavior makes them feel uncomfortable.  If a person or persons views being researched online as a violation of boundaries, you either need to respect it or establish that you do not respect their boundaries.  While they might not be able to stop you, they certainly don&amp;#39;t need to like or accept the behavior in a social context.  One way displaying displeasure with such behavior is to refer to it as &amp;quot;creeping&amp;quot; and those doing it as being a &amp;quot;creeper&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So another way to word your question is:  &amp;quot;Do people have a right to be upset that I learned things about them I found they posted online?&amp;quot;  I say yes, why?  Because people have a right to their feelings, people establish social norms and boundaries and may be upset when someone violates it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;First I much address:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;presumably was put there for exactly that purpose.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You presume to much, something posted on social media does not imply that the poster means for it be information observed, retained, and reported by every single person who could find access to it.  It might not be secret, but it is not meant to be a conversation piece either.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If I go to a coffee shop and have a personal conversation with a friend about my Mother dying of cancer, it&amp;#39;s not a secret conversation and people may over hear.  However if someone, even an acquaintance, comes up to me a month later and starts a conversation with &amp;quot;I heard you talking about your dying Mom at Starbucks last April.&amp;quot;  I&amp;#39;m going to find it off putting, and likely consider that person a creep.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The online world seems to become a place where people tell themselves that if a door is unlocked they are allowed inside.  If someone leaves a photo album open, they are allowed to open the book make copies of all the pictures and maybe using them in Photoshop later.  While legally, they are right with the second example, social norms in groups may have different rules.  These rules can change from group to group and you don&amp;#39;t have to agree to them to be held to them in the eyes of the group.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider is that people not only take issue with the action of being researched, they also take issue with and are made uncomfortable with  idea of someone taking the time and effort to research them and see what is available about them online.  They may not be able to stop said activity, but they certaintly don&amp;#39;t need to treat it as an acceptable for of social interaction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0
CMV: The government should NOT be able to force businesses to serve customers/cater events the business does not want to serve/cater.,"So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument. All modern economic transactions involving physical items (no stocks, capital, etc.) can be simplified down to a trade of money for labor. Yes, you can buy an item off the shelf at someplace like Target, but what you're really buying is the labor involved in making that item, the item being the end result of it. In other words, it is impossible to buy a physical item that is not shaped and made valuable by labor. In this sense, what you do when you walk to a pizzaria and buy a pizza is *directly* contract the labor of the pizza maker in exchange for money (as opposed to indirect contracting through a store, e.g. DiGornios). Because of this, businesses should have the right to refuse to labor for any particular individual, *for any reason*. If this is NOT the case, and some outside authority can force a person to preform labor they don't wish to preform, that could be seen as a type of slavery (I hate to use the term), because an outside authority is forcing a person, under the threat of force, to labor, even when that person doesn't want to.   So prove me wrong everyone, help me come to better formulate and understand my own ideas! That's what this sub is about, after all.

In local communities, being able to eat in the same restaurants, shop in the same stores, attend the same religious services and generally do all the same things as everyone else is in itself a demonstration of freedom and proof of equal legal status.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Being excluded from such activities singles out individuals in a manner that is not only humiliating but also subjugates those being excluded by denying them the same freedom as everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We already exclude and/or remove criminals and those adjudicated mentally defective (or whatever term you prefer) when they demonstrate either a willingness or inability to participate in society in a responsible, trustworthy and/or equitable manner, but only after we can demonstrate that fact according to strict rules and procedures in the judicial system. These rules and structures are in place precisely because the unjust or arbitrary exercise of power, especially to deny the freedom of others, or to otherwise violate their rights, is the very definition of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression""&gt;Oppression&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/liberty""&gt;Liberty&lt;/a&gt; is the ability to live, speak or otherwise act freely, especially without retribution or oppression. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We all have a right to Liberty. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the context of America and the philosophy of Individual Rights, which is the basis of our legal system, power and authority are derived from the function of the institutions that exercise that power. Cops can&amp;#39;t arbitrarily arrest people for being ugly, they must conduct arrests in accordance with the laws and structures that empower them. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Similarly, individual citizens cannot arbitrarily exercise power or authority over other citizens. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A gay person entering a business with the intention of paying for services or products is not inherently damaging to a business. Denying such a person service based on the individual beliefs of an owner or employee would be an arbitrary exercise of power, in direct violation of the customer&amp;#39;s Right to Liberty. Denying said customer legal recourse against such arbitrary exclusion would indirectly legitimize such exclusion and establish a &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; second class of citizens, which is inherently unconstitutional and blatantly harmful for what should be obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if the &amp;quot;Free Market&amp;quot; would deal with the problem (which btw, does not happen in areas of the country where such beliefs prevail). Excluding people due to personal beliefs is a violation of the Right to Liberty.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;#39;t even get into the fact that business owners utilize mail, law enforcement, contract law, trade agreements and property rights, among many other things which obligate business owners to treat tax-paying customers equally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses have the right to refuse service to any individual for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They do not have the right to refuse services to protected classes of individuals based on their belonging to that class when they provide those services to other equally qualified customers. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first is about individuals. If a black gay female comes into my store, acts like a complete and total jerk I can toss them out for not being someone I want to do business with. I can refuse service because I don&amp;#39;t want to be busy that day. I can refuse service because I don&amp;#39;t like them individually. I can refuse service because I just feel like it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The second is about groups of people. I can not refuse service to black gay females because they are black gay females. I can not withhold services from a person for reasons that have nothing to do with them individually and result only from my assumption of their inclusion in a particular group. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The reason for this is simple but multi-faceted and rests on a few bits of reality that people don&amp;#39;t like to think about sometimes:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;1) Businesses exist because of civil society. There&amp;#39;s a reason Somalia isn&amp;#39;t a libertarian utopia even though there&amp;#39;s absolutely no government interference in business. It is because there is no civil society at all that businesses can not function there at all. This is more than just about government and law enforcement too. Governments allow the existence of a high functioning civil society: working infrastructure for business; schooling so that businesses have literate employees; working financial systems by which to transact business; means for customers to move from business to business safely to conduct transactions; and so forth. However, governments are not the sum total of a high functioning civil society. This requires more than a government. Syria has a government. But the people of Syria are not free to live their lives unencumbered by unnecessary interferences in their lives. The question is what interferences are necessary and which are not. Civil society, in the experience of history, seems to work best when all members of society can decide that question together; and with their collective, rather than individual, best interests as the focus. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;2) Because business depend on civil society, civil society has authority to tell businesses what they can and can not do in order to maintain that civil society. This includes following laws that limit the freedoms of businesses. Businesses, just like individuals, have to respect the rights of others. You can not intentionally harm other people for no justifiable reason. While you can punch someone in self-defense, the legal defense against that charge is a positive defense not a negative one. That is, you can&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;self defense&amp;quot; and walk away. You generally have to be able to show that it was self-defense. You can punch someone in the face. But if you don&amp;#39;t have a reason for doing so that society accepts as valid, you&amp;#39;ve violated their rights and exceeded your own. Likewise, businesses can&amp;#39;t do things that are obviously harmful to society, such as dumping raw sewage into the public drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;3) One of the lessons of the civil rights movement is that &amp;quot;separate isn&amp;#39;t equal.&amp;quot; For civil society to work we all need to have reasonable access to the aspects of society that make society function as a civil society. It is a violation of an individual&amp;#39;s rights to execute their own life to preclude them from society on the basis of basic discriminatory practices of the majority. We can&amp;#39;t simply say we don&amp;#39;t want black people in our schools, or that gay people can not drive on the roads, or that women shall not have access to jobs.  And again, we know that civil society is more than merely the collection of government functions. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if black people have access to the same rights as white people if there are no black people in the area because no one will do business with them outside of the government. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;4) Civil society, while dependent upon government is more than government. Through the 1900s people exercised their &amp;quot;individual freedom&amp;quot; to refuse business to those in minority groups. The results were segregated communities where black people simply could not live. No one would sell them a private home because the mortgage clauses came with rules against reselling the homes to black people. No one would sell them food, because the local grocers wouldn&amp;#39;t do business with &amp;quot;those people.&amp;quot; No one would treat them if they were sick and injured, so they would die without proper medical care unnecessarily. None of this involved the power of the state. But the collective actions of individuals of the majority precluding minorities from participating in civil society created significant civil strife and endangered civil society&amp;#39;s continued existence. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;5) Ergo, the people of the democratic republic demanded that civil society address the issues of lack of inclusion of minorities. The result was that civil society decided collectively that businesses were free to exist and operate within civil society but one of the personal rights they could not violate was the right to not be discriminated against based on membership in a protected minority. Now, this law has plenty of controversy around what should and should not be a protected minority. However, there&amp;#39;s absolutely zero basis for any contention that civil society, upon which a businesses ability to exist depends, lacks the authority to set such rules. Further, the experience of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries demonstrates quite clearly that failure to consider overt discrimination a crime resulted in significant social harms that negatively impacted civil society in a way that was considered unacceptable, and legitimately threatened it&amp;#39;s continued existence. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
CMV: Bagged Cereal is superior to boxed cereal in every way,"Oat blenders.  Mini spooners.  Coco roos.  Honey Scooters.  You know them.  You see them in the cereal section of any grocery store.  They are in giant bags in a metal bin right next to the boxed cereals.  Far too often, these bagged cereals are breezed past and not rightfully regarded as the most superior way to purchase cereal.  * Price - Cant beat it.  Per unit weight, they are far cheaper than their boxed counterparts.  * Freshness - Fresh to death.  The bags all come with a resealable spout, much like a ziploc bag.  Squeeze all the air out, reseal, and you are ready for the next day.    * Taste - Admittedly, they are not superior in taste to boxed counterparts.  But they are indistinguishable.    * Environmental - Bagged cereals use less than half the packaging of boxed cereals.    * Quantity - Get a lot more, which prevents you from having to worry about breakfast for much longer.   * Hilarity - I snicker to myself every day that I pour myself a bowl of apple zings. Never once chuckled at a box of applejax.   Edit - Some good points about selection and variety.  Maybe I should have rephrased my title better to reflect that bagged cereals are better than their boxed counterparts.  I want to reward people for their good points, but I don't know if deltas are the best way to do it as my view was not changed. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boxes:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;stack neatly (if the sizes match, which they are standardized)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;give you cardboard which can be used for crafts or educational purposes.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition, boxed-cereal brands typically:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;provide better reading material/activities on the back of the box&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;contain better &amp;quot;prizes&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;have more entertaining ad campaigns, which in turn fund other types of entertainment.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if that&amp;#39;s enough of a difference to merit the price difference. (And honestly, almost all, even &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; breakfast cereal is diabetes-bait. I&amp;#39;d stick with a nice omelette or steel-cut oats with sea salt.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boxed cereal stores better in that you can stack them. The extra price is that you are paying for that storage and for a brand name. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As for freshness, that is fairly  random. You are not at all guaranteed for them to be more fresh. I have also never encountered a bagged cereal with a resealable spout. They have always required attempting to tie the bag in some manner or putting them in a separate container. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,2.0
CMV: Zoos can be ethical,"It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified:  * The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for, either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild. If we're using the usual justification of animal rights - they can feel pain/have a life - then letting them lead a safe and happy life in captivity seems to be more moral than the dangers of the wild.  * This is a less quantifiable good, but zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies.  While I guess the best way to C my V would be to provide overwhelming evidence that zoos provide lower quality of life for the animals than life in the wild and that there are more effective means of conserving/promoting endanger species, I'm mostly interested in values/premises I haven't considered.

The reasons why some animals are protected in the wild or in a zoo are wildly irrational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of these animals are &amp;#39;exotic&amp;#39; and you concern has very little chance of changing things in these animals former countries. Also there are many other ways to attract attention to these animals than enslave them and put them in a cage. We actually did that at the World Expo in Brussels with Congolese tribesmen. And I can conclusively confirm that it wasn&amp;#39;t really conductive to intercultural understanding and enlightenment. It was another freak show, and the exploitation of living beings for financial purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So yes, zoo can be ethical but it has never been their vocation. They are not actual non-profit organizations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is true and useful.  But only a tiny percentage of animals in zoos are endangered.  Also, &lt;em&gt;keeping them in zoos&lt;/em&gt; renders them unable to live in the wild.  A far more effective, long term method of preserving endangered species is to protect the wildlife in which they live.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Animals who are born, raised or otherwise spend long periods of time in zoos are no longer able to survive in the wild.  It&amp;#39;s actually considered immoral to release them into the wild because they will die long before their ability to mate.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is true that zoos bring animals closer to humans, but there isn&amp;#39;t any evidence to show that humans are more caring of the wildlife environment as a result.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though, mostly zoo life for animals is a lot like prison life for humans.  No one would argue that a human in prison is alive.  Or that it&amp;#39;s not cared for.  Humans have food, shelter, entertainment and social structure.  But all of the things that make life worth living are gone.  The ability to build a family.  The option to find a mate.  The ability to build the things in our lives which we each assign value to.  Animals are not so different.  They might mate with another because they are incited to.  But they often have ideas of who they like or don&amp;#39;t.  They cannot hunt their food in spite of an evolutionary drive to do so.  Also, often, the topic of animal depression is discussed in zoos where it would be nearly nonexistant in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is the guarantee of &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt; which is more than the wild offers.  But it is a guarantee of a &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of life which is less than is offered in freedom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",1,2.0
"CMV: Someone who exaggerates their finances or has $10,000 in credit card debt at over 20% interest is not qualified to be President.","*I am not saying that they should be banned from running, but I am saying that regardless of their policies, it is dangerous to let someone with $10,000 in credit card debt or someone who inflates their net worth by billions to run a major economy.*  **Donald Trump**: His self-reported net worth, in excess of ""TEN BILLION DOLLARS"", is significantly above third-party estimates as well as above his own figure of ~$7b from several months earlier, which included over $1b of bullshit naming rights.

Eliminating a President because of one flaw, no matter how severe, can be bad.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For instance, if you had 10 candidates that exaggerate their finances while you have 1 candidate who doesn&amp;#39;t, but has policies that would essentially end the world due to their nuke trigger-happy beliefs, I definitely would not vote the last one for fear of Cold War: The Sequel (This time, it&amp;#39;s personal).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I definitely would never vote Trump and Scott Walker either, but not for those reasons alone. Had they had incredible policies that would improve this nation better than the other candidates, I would have chosen them as the President despite this one aspect. There&amp;#39;s a potential they may damage the economy somewhat, yes, but if their policies can make up for that, I&amp;#39;d choose them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the examples you gave are bad Presidents altogether, but concrete examples aside, the concept is there.

CMV: The truth of an idea should matter more than its politics,"What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. Those aspects are about whose power and legitimacy the idea undermines, and they have no bearing on truth, which should be the only thing that determines the believability of an idea.  Here is an example of a true racist idea: ice age adaptations make caucasians less athletic than black people. It's mainly noticeable at the extremes: the best black athletes are better than the best white athletes. I should believe this idea because evidence supports it, and not be afraid of the power dynamics it may disrupt. That is *intellectual integrity*. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose an old man lies on his deathbed, and you are his estranged son. As he lies dying, he apologizes for the issue that has caused a rift between you, and asks for your forgiveness. No matter what he says, though, you can&amp;#39;t really find it in your heart to give it to him. So do you lie and tell him you forgive him, or do you tell him the truth and make his final moments painful?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Consider another situation. The prime minister of a nation is the best they have every seen. Under his leadership, the wealth gap between the rich and the poor has decreased; democracy has flourished from the ruins of the previous dictatorship; GDP has increased dramatically, and foreign investments are pouring in. You are his secretary, and one day you accidentally walk in on him having sex with another man, who you recognize as another member of the government he has close ties with. The people in your country are socially conservative, and the knowledge that he has sex with men and is cheating on his wife would ruin him. One day, a reporter comes up to and says that she has suspicions of just this. Do you answer her honestly?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s naive to say truth is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing that every matters about a statement. Honesty is a good policy because we cannot function without trust. But truth functions as a weapon just as much as misinformation. It is a true fact that black people have lower IQs than white people. Stating this fact without context (the fact that IQ correlates with environment and social class, the subsequent discussion about why African Americans tend to be in a lower social class due to the effects of American history and why this is almost certainly not genetic, the fact that IQ tests are biased in favor of the life experiences of the writers, the fact that a reverse Pygmalion effect exists racially, the fact that race as we use it is a social construct and that generalizations over race are basically meaningless the way most people use them, and so on) ends up having a sociopolitical effect anyway. Rather than explain why the fact does not imply what most people think it implies, I would rather not state the fact in the first place because facts don&amp;#39;t exist in a vacuum. I wouldn&amp;#39;t lie about it- but I wouldn&amp;#39;t bring it up unless I knew my audience would understand it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The truth is important. The problem is that the truth is wrapped up in a web of theory, and the wrong truths to the wrong theories will lead to people holding harmful views. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I think I agree mostly, but the way humans tend to process generalized information, unless you&amp;#39;re very precise with the idea you run the risk of, by holding a true and honest idea in your mind, carrying and perpetuating a false &lt;em&gt;impression&lt;/em&gt; resulting from that idea. Let&amp;#39;s take your proposed example for analysis:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a true racist idea: ice age adaptations make caucasians less athletic than black people. It&amp;#39;s mainly noticeable at the extremes: the best black athletes are better than the best white athletes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; noticeable at the extremes. In the NFL, for example, 68% of players are black vs. 17% of the U.S. population. At the collegiate level black athletes are about 45% of the player population, and at the high school level the ratios are even less skewed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In other sports, however, it&amp;#39;s not really as clear or precise as you say. For example, Kenyans (specifically a particular tribe of Kenyans) dominate marathons, but you don&amp;#39;t see them dominating in the NFL, do you? Or look in international football (soccer) competitions... the German world cup team (a bunch of whiteys) has done pretty well over the years, with tons of championships. Other national teams have also shown excellence, despite a lack of black athletes. The phrase &amp;quot;less athletic&amp;quot; is such a coarse generalization that it might give you the impression that white players cannot be competitive at the highest level, or that in the median competitive range (where most actual people would exist) that it&amp;#39;s not close enough as to be ignorable. By perpetuating that unqualified general idea (even if in some sense correct) you&amp;#39;re risking perpetuating a lot of related specific ideas that are false.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And for ideas that are &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt;, don&amp;#39;t you think that a false idea that causes suffering is worse than a false idea that causes no suffering or at least causes less suffering? If so, then presenting a true general idea that carries with it associated false and harmful ideas, should be undertaken much more cautiously than a true general idea that has little associated downside, shouldn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;",0,1.0

Not TV talking heads who act as if the scientific establishment is some sort of corporate monster whose goal is to poison food and children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over &lt;a href=""http://journals.lww.com/journalpatientsafety/Fulltext/2013/09000/A_New,_Evidence_based_Estimate_of_Patient_Harms.2.aspx""&gt;200,000 deaths are associated with preventable medical errors.&lt;/a&gt; You know who prevented a lot of these medical errors? The patients. But that&amp;#39;s not possible in a world where popularity trumps knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When people adopt counter- and non-scientific opinions, massaged into fact-shaped blurbs by TV charlatans, they replace reason with rationalization. They become trained to accept utterly arbitrary data based on how well it soothes their mind and conforms to their biases rather than the outcome of clinical trials. And when the real scientific process, ugly, slow, and unintuitive, rears its head, they become hostile towards it. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Charlatans crave ignorance, and when their audiences accept their roles as empty-headed children, unworthy of and uninterested in knowledge of the real world, our society becomes ever more dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Basic ethical concepts in medicine like &lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent""&gt;&amp;quot;informed consent&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; become impossible.

Blinded by lies and deprived of tools, we rely on luck and chance.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with false hope in impossible situations. But these are not impossible situations. This is nutrition. These are basic, daily concerns, containing no harsh or unbearable truths.

CMV: USA was unjustified in bombing Japan to hasten the end of World War 2. The government of USA should apologize from the nation of Japan.,"Why I hold this view:  1.  America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.  2. Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda executed a brutal plan to orchestrate the 9/11 attacks. [According to them, their major motivation was to end the presence of US in gulf countries and other motives as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks#Motives) For this purpose they chose to ram airplanes in the WTC  &amp; Pentagon to achieve maximum civilian casualties and make a frightening spectacle for the US public. The ends justify the means seems to be their reasoning. Was Al-Qaeda &amp; Co justified in perpetrating 9/11?  No one would say yes.       If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths.    3. Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.  4. The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared. How do we even know the outcome of Operation Downfall? Moreover Japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the Secretary Of War, Henry Louis Stimson agreed:   “Japan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.”   We erased two cities and its people from history. We dehumanized them, reduced them to a statistic. W[e even censored images and stories of the Japanese victims to push the narrative in our direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Depiction.2C_public_response_and_censorship). At least the Government should officially apologize to the nation of Japan. ","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hiroshima and Nagasaki were entirely justified by the standards of the time. You&amp;#39;re objection is also rather interesting, because you seem to be hung up on the use of nuclear weapons, when that&amp;#39;s not even the worst thing that was done:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hiroshima had 100,000 dead. Nagasaki is around 80,000.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Firebombing of Tokyo, using conventional weapons: 120,000.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Battle of Berlin: 200,000 dead, of which 22,000 were civilians, but where a massive number of the &amp;quot;soldiers&amp;quot; were actually conscripted elderly men and young boys.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Battle of Stalingrad: 1,700,000 to 2,000,000 casualties, 40,000 of which were civilians that fell to Luftwaffe air raids &lt;em&gt;in the first week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rape of Nanking: Unknown, on the order of 100,000 to 300,000.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Battle of Okinawa: 120,000 soldiers killed, and 150,000 civilians killed or committed suicide, amounting to 1/4 of the local population. &lt;strong&gt;Bear in mind that this happened immediately prior to the bombings, and were used as a case study as to what could happen if the US invaded the Japanese mainland.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition, by this point in the war, 20,000 Chinese were dying every week under the Japanese occupation of China, which was still ongoing despite the disastrous nature of the Pacific campaign for Japan.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The fact of the matter is that Operation Downfall was something the US military wanted to avoid, particularly in the wake of Okinawa, where the civilians themselves fought off the US forces or committed mass suicide. The Japanese casualty figures for a mainland invasion were a direct extrapolation of what happened on Okinawa.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All told, 60,000,000 people (at least) died in World War II. There was significant evidence at the time that an invasion of Japan would have tacked on another 10,000,000 to 15,000,000.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition, the Japanese weren&amp;#39;t going to surrender to the terms that the Allies demanded (which themselves were terms that were meant to prevent &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; world war from ever occurring). Ultimately, the bombings were a necessary event that brought an end to probably the most horrific decade our species has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The comparison to 9/11 is also not appropriate, because the bombings were between two countries in a declared state of war, and where actual military targets were identified, and also in an era where civilian casualties were much more acceptable. In all likelihood, if we hadn&amp;#39;t nuked the two cities, we would have obliterated them with conventional weapons. 9/11, on the other hand, was a direct attack against a target that was entirely civilian in nature, and against another target that was staffed almost entirely by civilians, and in the modern era where civilian casualties are no longer acceptable (largely due to the horrors of WWII, as well as Vietnam and Korea).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;","&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;America can&amp;#39;t ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war.
